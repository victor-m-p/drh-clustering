211,Amarna Religion,35,Religious Group (v5),"Tell el-Amarna is the modern name for the ancient city, Akhetaten. It was created by Amenhotep IV, who would later change his name to Akhenaten. This ruler emphasized the role of the god Aten, promoting the belief that this god was primary among all other gods in ancient Egypt, and presented himself as the god's one true prophet and intermediary. This meant that the other Egyptians were cut off from direct access to their gods. At this time in Egyptian history, the god Amun had become particularly prominent, and Akhenaten's workers moved through Egypt erasing the name of Amun (as well as his divine family members, Mut and Khonsu). Aten is the solar disk, and so the religion of this period, often referred to as Amarna Religion, emphasizes solar elements. Access to light and sun were central to the practice of Amarna Religion, including leaving temple spaces open. This period is a dramatic and short break from the normal state of affairs in ancient Egypt. After Akhenaten's death, traditional religion was returned to Egypt, with considerable efforts to erase any references to Akhenaten, or, ""that fallen foe from Amarna"". The city of Akhetaten was abandoned, which has left it well preserved for modern excavators. In modern periods, Amarna Religion has often been seen as the earliest monotheistic religion, though this is an oversimplification of at least religious practice at this time. While Akhenaten promoted the Aten as the most important god, and then the only god, there is significant evidence for the worship of other gods at this time, particularly in domestic contexts, including at Amarna. There is therefore evidence that not all Egyptians followed the ideas put forward by Akhenaten. Sigmund Freud, however, who was an avid reader of the Egyptologist James Henry Breasted, identified Amarna as the source of biblical monotheism, which is a big reason that this period is so well known by the public.",-1350,-1320,34,707,Thomas Schneider,5,Courtney Fitzsimmons,2015-04-08 18:45:44.060 +0200,2022-03-11 19:18:39.657 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),9.464186020720812e-24,0.8003624956903672,1.7097842035660795e-35,8.40548466500056e-24,0.07452237866459545,0.12511512564503738

358,16th-17th c. Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava Tradition,35,Religious Group (v5),"The Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava tradition is a Hindu devotional tradition that originated in the Bengal region of India during the 16th century. The 16th-17th centuries were a particularly theologically formative and constructive time for this group. Most traditions considered ""Hindu"" view the collection of texts referred to as the śruti, or “that which is heard,” which includes the Vedic Saṃhitās and Upaniṣads as the most authoritative sacred texts. Among these, many, including the early Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava theologians, attribute more authority to various texts belonging to the genre of smṛti, or “that which is remembered.” Among these texts, there is no more authoritative than the Bhāgavata Purāna.


Using the Bhāgavata Purāna as the basis for their theology, early Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava theologians drew on a range of existing texts and traditions and used various hermeneutical strategies to develop and advocate for a path of devotion (bhakti-mārga) to Kṛṣṇa, the exclusive and supreme object of devotion (bhakti). They argue this path is superior to all other soteriological paths and the best means for realizing one’s true eternal nature (svarūpa), attaining the highest level of transcendental pleasure (ānanda), and achieving liberation from the cycle of birth and death (sāṃsāra). 

The starting point of the path of devotion is śraddhā, or ‘faith;’ the overarching goal of following the path is to attain premā, or ‘divine love’ for Kṛṣṇa; and the principal means of attaining premā consists of faithfully engaging in sādhana, a range of diverse regulated religious practices that systematically engage the mind and body in devotional acts. In the course and consequence of attaining the goal of premā, early Gauḍīya theologians reference and describe occurrences of devotees having what they refer to as a ‘direct perceptual experience’ (sākṣātkāra) of Kṛṣṇa relative to the devotee’s qualifications and devotional temperament.",1500,1699,620,343,Travis Chilcott,24,Travis Chilcott,2016-09-08 07:00:00.000 +0200,2024-06-11 13:16:37.320 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.11267504746391592,0.003232775802067392,0.7925053782917049,0.09156679261274143,2.000582957031626e-05,2.687559596466388e-33

415,Shaiva World Renouncers,35,Religious Group (v5),"Hindu ascetics renounce social structures, sexual activities, and the Vedic sacrificial fire which symbolizes society. When sadhus (female: sadhvin, but usually, female ascetics are also referred to with the male term sadhu) renounce the social world, they are ritually dead to their old life and are reborn into a new one: They get a new name and are part of a new family. The final goal of most renouncers is a release from the cycle of rebirths. The religious practices of Hindu ascetics are diverse and include rituals, devotional acts, and social service. Lay devotees admire them for their possible spiritual powers, but also fear them for the potential dangers arising from these powers.

Edinoverie allowed the converts from Old Belief to use their previously prohibited rituals and provided them with churches and monasteries where the 'old rites' could be used. This establishment of edinoverie was initiated and supported by the imperial Russian state. Edinovertsy, as the converts to edinoverie were known, were either peasants or merchants: by the time of the Russian Revolution, they numbered no more than 250,000 to 300,000, grouped around approximately 300 parishes scattered across the empire.

442,Donatism,35,Religious Group (v5),"Donatism emerged in North Africa as a result of disagreements over the proper way to deal with Christians who lapsed during the persecutions. Against the mainstream, Donatists argued that the lapsed could never re-enter the Church.

A contested episcopal election of 311, in which the Donatists and the Catholics each elected their own bishop, led to the Donatists appealing to Constantine in 313 to determine the rightful bishop. Constantine sided against the Donatists. From 317-321, he ordered their suppression using measures akin to those of the persecuting emperors: confiscating property, exile, and death. A brief but violent revival of the persecution occurred in 347-348 under his son, Constans. The emperor Julian (361-363) supported Donatism and brought Donatist bishops back from exile as part of a broader program to undermine Catholic Christianity. 

Augustine of Hippo often wrote against them, and the Council of Carthage in 411 also condemned them. Nevertheless, Donatists made up the majority of North African Christians from the fourth to fifth centuries.

443,Tyva (Buddhism),35,Religious Group (v5),"Tibetan Buddhism’s influence in Inner Asia swept through in a few major waves.

The second wave arrived nearly a thousand years later during the Ch’ing (Manchu) dynasty beginning in 1634 (Barfield 1992; Heissig 1980). Arguably, another wave currently in progress was marked by the demise of the Soviet Union. During their repression of Buddhism in the form of executions and the destruction of lamaseries (Mänchen-Helfen 1992: 107), the Soviets destroyed Tyva’s center of Buddhism—the Üstüü Khüree temple in 1937.

However, what we know of Essene belief and practice is unsurprising within first-century Judaism. Essene identity did not preclude identity as Pharisee or priest, and the Essene movement was itself probably internally diverse, popular, and influential.

472,Karma Kagyu or Kamtsang Kagyu,35,Religious Group (v5),"Karma Kagyu (Tib: karma bka' brgyud) is one of the major lineages of the Kagyud school of Tibetan Buddhism. Dusum Khyenpa (dus gsum mkhyen pa) or the 1st Karmapa (1110-1193) founded the lineage in the 12th century in Tibet by nurturing thousands of students and building three major monasteries as his main seats. In the Tibetan spiritual history, he was known as the first reincarnated lama (Tibetan sprul sku: Taking rebirth consciously and on purpose) of Tibet. After receiving profound meditation instructions from Gampopa (1079-1153), his principal teacher, he meditated over sixteen years on the snowy mountains of Kampo Gangra and Tsurphu and conquered his inner channels and breathe, which means he found a survival skill without depending on the outer world. His fame and teachings soon spread all over Tibet, thus, many students, i.e. scholars, Yogis, merchants, and farmers, gathered together around him for seeking his teachings. 

Teachings of the lineage mainly focused on a particular method of unifying Mahamudra meditation with Six Yogas of Naropa. Besides that the school practices vast and various sutra and tantra teachings within both monastic and lay audiences. Because of the group identity, monasteries, and the selected teaching transmissions, etc, the lineage was transformed into a systematic school after the Karmapa's death. The lineage has continued for around nine hundred years within the Asian countries. Recently, after 1959, led by the 16th Karmapa Rangjung Rigpe Dorje (1924-1981), the glory of Karma Kagyu reached an international audience. As a result, in the 21st century, this lineage becomes one of the largest and charismatic Tibetan Buddhist organizations in the world led by two young and talented 17th Karmapas, Ugyen Trinley and Thaye Dorje. Under their leadership, the religious organization has thousands of monasteries, nunneries, monastic institutes, and lay Buddhist Centres around the globe. 

Lastly, although being an expert in this lineage both academically and empirically, I admit that many answers here are not absolute but variable of time, place, and people. Also, I found that many questions asked here are anthropological and social science-based inquiries, in which the lineage may or may not necessarily have the answers.

However, beginning in the 10th century, some Cham communities began to become influenced by Islam as well. During the seventeenth century, the contemporary form of Cham Ahiér religion became more standardized, as rulers from the Kingdom of Panduranga encouraged practices that blended concepts from the Cham Awal - who practiced a localized form of Islam - and the Cham Ahiér, whose practice is predominantly based on a Brahmanic form of Hinduism.

The first emperor to receive an official deification was Augustus in 14 CE, although the deification of Julius Caesar, and the establishment of his cult after his assassination in 44 BCE, can be seen as a precursor. Although involving the traditional material and ritual culture of Roman religions—temples, altars, sacrifices, festivals, priesthoods—the cult was not strictly defined, and substantial variations existed across geographic regions and time periods. The spread of the cult throughout newly acquired territories was an important vehicle for the establishment of Roman imperial authority. For the local elites in provincial cities, the imperial cult offered opportunities to simultaneously express affiliation to Roman values, while promoting individual power agendas.

562,Medieval Śrīvaiṣṇavism,43,Religious Group (v6),"Śrīvaiṣṇavism is a Hindu sect that worships Viṣṇu along with his consort Śrī, the main leader of which is Rāmānuja (traditional dates: 1017: 1137), a proponent of viśiṣtādvaita (‘qualified non-dualism’). This tradition is based on ubhaya-vedānta, i.e. both the Sanskrit and the Tamil scriptures. The latter consists essentially of the poetry of the Āḻvārs (Tamil bhakti poets [6th-9th centuries]), collectively known as the Nālāyira Tivviya Pirapantam (or Nālāyira Divya Prabandham), especially Nammāḻvār’s Tiruvāymoḻi, which is referred to as the drāviḍa-veda (‘Tamil Vedas’) or dramiḍopaniṣad (‘Tamil Upaniṣad’). Therefore, this sect, while not limited to Southern India, is much more present in that region than elsewhere. Around the 13th-15th centuries, differences of opinions began to rise with its important ācāryas (e.g. Piḷḷai Lokācārya [traditional dates: 1264-1327], Vedānta Deśika [traditional dates: 1268-1369] and Maṇavāḷa Māmuni [traditional dates: 1370-1445]) interpreting the scriptures differently on a few theological issues. This schism became cristallised a couple of centuries later (around the 18th-19th centuries), leading to the formation of two schools, the Northern (vaṭakalai) and the Southern (teṉkalai) ones.

564,Tribal Christianity (and allied castes) in the Himalayas,43,Religious Group (v6),"The tribal Christian population of the high Himalayas and low-lying hills spans five countries (India, Nepal, Pakistan, Bhutan and China) and contested boarderlands (Tibet, Sikkim, Aksai Chin and Kashmir, among others). It encompasses approximately 6 million people. The largest Christian tribal populations are 4.9 million converted Baptists, Presbyterians and Catholics in Northeast India and 375,000 Evangelical Protestants in Nepal (a figure sometimes rounded up to 1 million) -- arguably the fastest-growing Christian population in the world. Small but important Christian tribal communities are in Bhutan, Sikkim, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Jammu and Kashmir. The historical timeline of tribal conversion to Christianity depends on the region and date of missionary penetration into the hills. The Portuguese Jesuit João Cabral was arguably the first European to access the Himalayan region in 1627 with missionary designs. Since then, thousands of missionaries have come into the Himalayan region, from the London-based Church Missionary Society (Punjab region through the 20th century) to the recent explosion of South Korean missionaries populating language institutes and centered in the Kathmandu Valley. Indigenous house churches have sprouted up in remote tribal villages. Himalayan tribal Christianity falls into a broad spectrum of official affiliation. Some expressions of tribal Christianity are largely indigenous and invisible; they address local aspirations and offer respite from spiritual affliction and caste discrimination within circumscribed tribal cosmologies and social stratifications. Other expressions of tribal Christianity are hooked into international NGOs and global ideoscapes promoting salvation that are backed by foreign patronage and theological instruction; they are networked through social media platforms and employ a range of conversion techniques associated with Western (and South Korean) Evangelicalism. In some cases, tribal Christianity in the Himalayas allows discriminated-against Dalit groups who are embedded within tribal formations to find self-respect and social validation within the new idiom of salvation and equality under Yesu Masih (Jesus Christ). Although Christians are persecuted throughout South Asia, overt violence against the minority religion is not as strongly evident in the Himalayan tribal range as it is in Pakistan and non-Himalayan India states (especially Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Odisha, where in 2007-08 in Kandhamal District 50 Christians were killed and 95 churches burned down). The rise of right-wing Hindutva politics since 2014 and the disproportionate criminalization of Christian conversion as coercive have pushed Christianity further into the social margins everywhere through India, including the Himalayan tribal belt. As would be expected, Christian tribals in the Himalayas are not strongly unified around their minority religious status; divided by language, geography and often theology and sectarian affiliation, they are sometimes balkanized into subdividing communities. Nevertheless, they are conceptually and anthropologically interconnected as a Pan-Himalayan community of faith, spiritual aspiration and unique forms of theological syncretism.",1950,2018,799,576,Stephen Christopher,5,Courtney Fitzsimmons,2018-05-06 11:08:27.895 +0200,2018-06-15 18:00:32.382 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.9587677971194699,2.2143375595561705e-13,1.384366046852565e-11,9.662743905186916e-11,0.04123220276983753,2.6305275185126893e-30

567,Gay and Lesbian Vaishnava Association (GALVA-108),35,Religious Group (v5),"GALVA-108 (The Gay and Lesbian Vaishnava Association) is an international nonprofit religious organization (incorporated in 2002) using hermeneutics and scriptural/historical interpretation of the Vedas and Vedic culture to argue for queer inclusivity within Gaudiya Vaishnavism and Hinduism in general. It is nonsectarian, has no official physical centers, and has been online for over 20 years. As an active community of queer Vaishnavas, GALVA-108 has about 4,000 worldwide followers and 200 currently active members. Western Europe and the West Coast of the USA are population centers. Although a cyber-organization, members are closely networked with each other and have had group meetings and shared pilgrimage not only in sacred places such as Vrindavan and Mayapura (sites associated with Lord Krishna) but also in their home countries (largely but not exclusively in North America, India and Europe). The organization was founded on May 8, 2001, by Amara Das Wilhelm, a direct disciple of A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. The founding intent was to counterbalance negative perceptions of queerness that were common within ISKCON (The International Society for Krishna Consciousness) and other Gaudiya Vaishnava groups. Amara Das published a research article about Vedic conceptions of non- normative gender and sexuality entitled “Tritiya-Prakriti: People of the Third Sex.” After publication and setting up a website (currently hosted by Wix), several queer followers began joining the cyber-community and GALVA-108 quickly spread through Yahoo!, Temenos and Gaudiya Vaishnava websites such as CHAKRA, VNN and Harmonist. Ultimately, group discussion was moved to several specific Facebook pages. In 2004 the research article was published as the first chapter of a book, which has been updated periodically and an abridged version produced in 2010. Arguably the only book dedicated to queer acceptance from a Vaishnava perspective, it was preceded by several well-cited academic volumes covering similar terrain, such as Ruth Vanita’s and Saleem Kidwai’s 2001 “Same-Sex Love in India: Readings from Literature and History.” The group is strongly devoted to the core teachings of Lord Caitanya as enunciated by the six Goswamis and shared by all Gaudiya Vaishnavas. Like all other Gaudiyas, they advocate sharing the sankirtana movement (congregational chanting of the Lord’s holy names) with everyone through the common means of public kirtana and the distribution of literature, books and prasada (sanctified food). In another sense, GALVA-108 stands apart by arguing for the centrality of LGBTQI+ people (often collectively called the ‘third gender’) in styles of deity worship and other temple-related practices. They focus on networking GALVA-108 members with other queer and third-gender communities worldwide and are theologically concerned with instilling God consciousness to queer followers, thereby ensuring not only virtuous living but also psychosocial wellbeing.

570,Supreme Master Ching Hai World Society,35,Religious Group (v5),"As Ching Hai initiates do not prefer to speak of their community as religious, it may be more precise to describe Suma Ching Hai as a transnational cybersect primarily composed of diasporic East and Southeast Asians. Suma Ching Hai is inseparable from a vast mediascape of online lectures, videos, chat groups, commercial enterprises and tightly-controlled official messaging. Sum Ching Hai is also a New Religious Movement that blends together aspects of Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity and messianic theology. The charisma of the Supreme Leader Ching Hai, called Thanh Hải in Vietnamese, binds the community together. She is often revered by initiates as partly divine, as a perfected being who preaches the proper meditation style (Quan Yin Method) and spreads compassion and the uplift of spiritual consciousness. Born in Vietnam, raised in the West and now based in Taiwan, Ching Hai teaches a syncretistic theology. Based on her time in India, she incorporates Sant Mat traditions, Surat Shabd Yoga (emphasizing divine sound and light), and Radhasoami as practiced in Beas. There are many similar theological touch points: 2 1/2 hours of required daily meditation; spiritual progression through stages of consciousness; abilities to experience astral planes; and total devotion on the spiritual master as an aspect of divinity. Practitioners of Ching Hai are given initiation after watching and summarizing (in written essays) 90 lectures of Ching Hai (available online) and practicing vegetarianism for at least 3 months. They are initiated by either Ching Hai herself or, more likely, by about twenty disciples who are authorized to perform initiations. Children of initiates are given ""half initiation"" at 6 and ""full initiation"" at 12 based on their spiritual advancement. Practice of Ching Hai depends on region: in Southeast Asia (Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam especially) and China, governments have branded Ching Hai as an ""evil cult"" and news stories abound about confiscations of illegal religious material or cult-like forms of psychological manipulation of initiates. In Vietnam, for example, Thanh Hải followers in Hanoi do so surreptitiously, with fear of government reprisal. Their meditation center is secret. Conversely, Thanh Hải  followers in Ho Chi Minh City are building an official meditation center and do not live under the same shroud of fearful secrecy. Besides official adherents, there are many people who practice Quan Yin Method privately and consume online material related to Ching Hai without identifying explicitly with a community or even community of faith. The global community of Ching Hai followers could be briefly summarized as bounded together by a range of theological beliefs, meditation practices and forms of digital consumption. Significant communities exist in Taiwan (called Qinghai Wushang Shijie Hui), where the main headquarters were established in 1986. Of Vietnamese origin, several thousand are practitioners and refer to Ching Hai affectionately as Chi Hai (""eldest sister"" in Vietnamese). Other concentrated populations of practitioners are in mainland China (although banned officially), South Korea, Singapore, Indonesia, Japan and California. Based on five normative precepts -- which includes not taking life and eating a vegan diet -- non-initiates of a vegan persuasion may discover this NRM by visiting one of 160 or so Loving Hut restaurants -- from Prague to Hanoi to San Jose -- where they will be exposed to Ching Hai's spiritually-infused artwork on the walls and her teachings beaming through 24 hour satellite TV. A cursory glance through online and printed media highlights the importance of veganism and these restaurants in shaping the public perception of Ching Hai (which is sometimes branded a ""Vegan Cult"" in Vice, for example).",1986,2018,806,576,Stephen Christopher,5,Courtney Fitzsimmons,2018-05-13 12:51:51.127 +0200,2018-06-09 20:42:06.672 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.6889476831413169,0.004965462115426312,1.6324768419557055e-11,0.29195915660099997,0.014127698125932113,1.721758195011911e-19

Prior to European contact and Christian/Muslim influence, the traditional Ganda (who refer to themselves as “Baganda”) religion was based upon a hierarchy of gods, ghosts, fetiches, and amulets. Religious beliefs were interwoven with political structure, so the Ganda religion is best described as coterminous with the society.

Most live along the Rereiket River (Siberut Island, Mentawai Archipelago, Indonesia), residing primarily, as of 2017, in the communities of Matotonan, Buttui, Ugai, Madobak (Madobag), and Rokdok (Rogdog), as well as the developing settlements between those villages and the region of Attabai. Some Sarereiket people have also moved into the settlements surrounding Muara Siberut, especially Muntei.

The Sarereiket Mentawai live both in settlement villages (barasi) and in traditional longhouses (uma) or other residences in the forest. Those living in settlement villages are more likely to attend regular services of religions like Protestantism, Catholicism, and Islam, and they are more likely to enroll their children in school.

The Nyakyusa are linguistically and culturally similar to the Ngonde, who live on the northwestern coastal plain of Lake Malawi. After the establishment of European colonial regimes (ca. 1870s), the Ngonde became a part of the British Protectorate of Nyasaland (known as Malawi after independence), and the Nyakyusa were incorporated into the German colony of Tanganyika (Now Tanzania). After World War I, Tanganyika passed to the British, who assumed the territory under a League of Nations mandate and administered it until independence. (Kenny, 2011).  

The Nyakyusa religion is best characterized as a system of shared beliefs and ritual practices that are interwoven with Nyakyusa society at large. The major elements of their religion include ancestral spirits, mystical powers, and the presence of witchcraft.

592,Veerashaivas,35,Religious Group (v5),"The Veerashaivas are devotees of Shiva, who emerged in in the 12th century, in regions that are now the modern states of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. The Veerashaiva path of devotion or bhakti was one that sought to remind its society that the mechanical performance of ritual would not help achieve 'arivu' or understanding. Arivu, led to the cessation of the cycle of birth and death. They also reminded the people around them that for moksha and for sadhana (striving towards it), all were equal, irrespective of class, caste and gender. Quite spontaneously, a number of people from different castes and communities followed this path of devotion and charted their self-transformation through a spontaneous verbalization of experience known as vachanas or simply, speech. Some describe the self-transormation in terms of six phases or Shatsthalas, which are Bhaktasthala, (2) Maheshsthala, (3) Prasadisthala, (4) Pranalingi Sthala, (5)
Sharanasthala and (6) Aiykasthala. 

Together, the Veerashaiva saints of the 12th century founded the Anubhava Mantapa, a forum for the discussion of experience, in the city of Kalyana, northern Karnataka. Anubhava literally means experience. Prominent figures of this mode of bhakti are Allama Prabhu, Basavanna, Akka Mahadevi, Soole Sankavva, Ayadakki Maramma, Devara Dasimayya and others. 

The vachanas explicate a yogic path and are essentially oral literature. The Veerashaivas are said to have emerged from earlier Shaivite sects such as the Kaalamukha and their tradition derives much from the Agamas. Many devotees of the Veerashaiva tradition took to expressing their devotion through madhura bhava (known specifically within the tradition as satipati bhava) or, love for the chosen deity and through surrender or sharanagati. The philosophy of surrender led to the Veerashaiva devotees to become known as 'shivasharanas.' For the Veerashaivas, Shiva is composed of Guru (teacher), Linga (abstract form of Shiva) and Jangama (guru with no attachments). The Veerashaivas believe in qualified monism or qualified non-dualism. 

Although the Veerashaivas expressed devotion in filial terms, their approach was largely renunciatory. They, however, did not quit society like other renunciants but instead stayed within and continued their duties. This continuation of the performance of labour but dedicating it from the beginning till end to the deity, Shiva, they considered as kayaka.",1200,2018,826,558,Sushumna Kannan,24,Travis Chilcott,2018-06-21 14:08:43.705 +0200,2020-09-25 11:55:55.410 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.9961103200775713,2.0832256398104606e-12,3.996780455009766e-21,2.699705893245161e-22,0.003889679920345428,3.14402416550029e-19

The first missionaries arrived in New Zealand in 1814, but a change in indigenous religious beliefs was gradual and not salient until several decades later.

623,Diasporic American Hinduism,43,Religious Group (v6),"In 1893, Swami Vivekananda spoke at the Parliament of World Religions and espoused a monistic version of Hinduism which continues to be influential in the United States today. He was one of the first emissaries of Hinduism in America. In 1965, the Immigration and Naturalization Act allowed for increased immigration from all regions of India to the US. These immigrants were mostly skilled workers, particularly in areas related to technology and medicine. This ushered in an era of temple building. Also at this time, there were many  Indian gurus who began movements in the United States, gathering followers and espousing wisdom. These gurus brought yoga with them and what was originally a Hindu meditative practice often became separated from its origins in its American context. Finally, these immigrants started families and now there are many Hindu-Americans who were born and raised in the United States. Temples continued to grow as community centers in part to educate this new generation of Hindus. This is different from how Hindu temples function in India. 

Hindus in America are people of both Indian and non-Indian origin who practice Hinduism in its American diasporic context, where there is no overarching governing structure, but where ""Hinduism"" as a whole becomes more codified, regardless of regional or sectarian differences, in part due to its contrast with other religious groups.

The Copper Inuit did not have official political leadership; power was fluid among these nomadic people. Their religious beliefs centered around non-human and human spirits, as well as strongly held taboos related to the separation of land and sea. Shamans were mediators between the living and supernatural, and their powers were due to control over spirits. Shamans had limited secular influence.

Due to the theistic nature of their beliefs and their status as a Vaiṣṇava school of theology, they also have distinctive beliefs that set them apart from other Brahmin communities, such as the belief in the doctrine of hierarchy of all beings, and the unique status given to the wind god Vāyu. Every member of the community is affiliated with a religious institution (maṭha), and each maṭha has a lineage of monks who contributed to the community through their philosophical and devotional writings.

639,Chinese Esoteric Buddhism (Tang Tantrism),43,Religious Group (v6),"Before mid-Tang, numerous texts containing Buddhist tantric practices and mantra had arrived in China and they were translated into Chinese. But the systematic and more particular version Esoteric Buddhism did not appear until Emperor Xuanzong's reign. Three Indian Tantric masters Śubhakarasiṃha (善無畏), Vajrabodhi (金剛智) and Amoghavajra (不空), brought the Esoteric Buddhist (later known in Japan as Zhenyan  真言, ""true word"", ""mantra"") tradition from 716 to 720 during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. Tantra/Esoteric Buddhism that has spread in Tang China and was transmitted to Japan during the same period via two famous masters Kukai (空海) and Saicho (最澄). This tradition highly depended on mandalas, mantras, mudras, abhiṣekas, and deity yoga, containing magical rituals, spells, and other elements also seen in other Indian religions. Gradually this systematic tradition died out in China after the destruction of Buddhism during the Wuzong period (846). Later during the Song, more Esoteric Buddhist texts were brought to the Song court and translated, but their influence was incomparable to Tang tantric Buddhism. However, various elements and practices still existed in Chan and Pure Land Buddhism in China until today.

645,"Meo Muslim, Mev, Mewati Muslim",43,Religious Group (v6),"The Meo, also called Mev or Mewati Muslim, self-identify as a distinct socio-cultural ethnic community, and, despite their Muslim religion, trace their lineage to the Hindu Rajputs in North India. It is also contended that the Meo converted to Islam after leaving other Hindu caste groups and a tribe, Meena, with whom they shared several similarities or that they were a nomadic Islamic tribe called the Mids, or Meds, who migrated from Western India into the region now known as Mewat, between the ninth and eleventh centuries. Today, perceived as converts from Hinduism, the Meo, numbering around 20 lakh, are considered low caste, or Neech zat, by the Indian Muslims. The Meo men and women are disfavoured for marriage by the Indian Muslims because of their suspect religious identity and their low caste status within the Muslim hierarchy.

Till recently, they have considered themselves both as a caste group and a distinct religious faith within Islam because of this dual identity. During the colonial period, they were considered a distinct caste by both Hindus and Muslims. Their customs, traditions, life cycle ceremonies and modes of prayer, till the 1990s, closely replicated the Hindus with nominal adherence to Islamic practices like circumcision, nikah or marriage ceremony, and the burial. Though lauded for their syncretic culture and religious practises that adopted and adapted traditions from both religions without succumbing to the hard-core religiosity of either, they historically faced rejection from both the faiths because of their identification as neither a ‘true’ Muslim nor Hindu. 

Historically, the Meo inhabited a geographically contiguous space called Mewat or the ‘land of the Meo’, understood more as a cultural space than an administrative unit. In present-day India, it is administratively divided up between the districts of Nuh (formerly Mewat), Palwal, and Faridabad in southern Haryana and Alwar and Bharatpur and Dholpur districts in Rajasthan.

679,Santal,43,Religious Group (v6),"The largest of South Asia's tribal populations, the Santals live in the Indian states of Bihar, West Bengal, and Orissa (Carrin-Bouez and Beierle, 1998). Christian missionaries arrived in the region around the mid-1800's, but found little success in conversion attempts. The Santal religion is primarily concerned with numerous spirits/deities known as Bongas, which are of various classes (such as clan, village, family, and specific places). A high god is present but otiose. The village priest (Ato Naeke) and his assistant (Kudam Naeke) are responsible for communicating with the supernatural realm, as well leading communal religious ceremonies. In addition to the Ato Naeke and Nudam Naeke are other practitioners, such as the hunt-priest (Dehri), herbalist/medicine man, Bonga-doctor (Ojha), and witch detector (Jan guru) (Biswas, 1956:107). Religious practitioners (mainly the village priest) typically work with the village headmen. Because the Santal religious beliefs and practices are bound up with many aspects of society, this entry considers the Santal religious group to be coterminous with the society at large.

Mata devotees have typically belonged to lower-caste and Dalit groups, though middle-caste groups such as Rajputs also hold Matas in high esteem as clan goddesses. Mata worship has traditionally taken place at small shrines in rural areas and villages, though Mata temples have recently grown in size and number in urban areas, particularly since the liberalization of India's economy in 1990. The number of Mata adherents is difficult to calculate, as individual religious affiliation is often plural in Gujarati Hinduism, though the figure is likely growing, as a gaining preference for a Brahmin-styled ritual repertoire at Mata sites has drawn in some upper-caste devotees.",1850,2019,677,651,Darry Dinnell,40,Stephen Christopher,2019-05-21 23:21:05.227 +0200,2019-05-22 21:42:25.894 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.8503409616789884,0.019713521912062524,6.51354954839697e-11,0.12598509904686472,0.003960417296948926,6.626245399035588e-21

682,Lakher,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Lakher, who refer to themselves as the Mara, “inhabit the south-eastern corner of the Lushai Hills district, south of the Haka sub-division of the Chin Hills, and the extreme north of the Arakan Hill Tracts” (Parry, 1932:1). This area is located primarily in the Indian state of Mizoram, but also extends into Burma and Bangladesh. The Lakher are comprised of six groups: the Tlongsai, Hawthai, Zeuhnang, Sabeu, Lialai, and Heima. These groups are further subdivided into clans, but the village (led by a chief or bei) is the primary social, political, and religious unit. This entry focuses around the time of 1930; just six years after the Lakhers came under British rule. At this time, Lakher customs remained largely unchanged by foreign influence (British government and Christian Missionaries), and traditional religious beliefs were still held by the majority of the Lakher population. The Lakher’s supreme high god is known as Khazangpa, who is believed to have created the world and holds control over all its inhabitants. Other supernatural beings include zang (tutelary deities/guardian spirits), leurahripas (demons/evil spirits), and ancestral spirits. No official religious practitioners are present; the heads of households perform most rites and sacrifices. Mediums (zhazanghneipa) have special communication with spirits, and typically use this communication for medicinal purposes (such as finding out what sacrifices to prescribe a woman hoping to increase her fertility, for example). Ceremonies are present, and accompany most major life-cycle events. Also present is a yearly cycle of rites/feasts associated primarily with agriculture and the propitiation of supernatural beings.  Zhazangpina is the most important sacrificial rite, which is performed by the head of a household in hopes of pleasing Zhazangpa, who will in turn bless the household with good health and prosperity. The Lakher’s religious beliefs are bound up with the functioning of society as a whole, so this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society at large.",1905,1935,910,577,Emily Pitek,1,M.

684,Huron,43,Religious Group (v6),"This entry is based upon ethnographic materials that reconstruct the Huron society prior to cultural changes as a result of outside influence. Reconstruction is made possible from accounts written by European traders and Jesuit missionaries during early contacts with the Huron. This entry focuses on the Bear (Attignawantan) and Cord (Attigneenongnahac) subtribes around the time of 1634, which were located between Lake Simcoe and the Georgian Bay in what is now Ontario, Canada. These two subtribes are the largest and oldest of the four Huron subtribes (the other two being the Tahontaenrat and Arendahronon). At the focal time of 1634, the village was the primary unit of daily life, encompassing social, economic, and religious importance. The village was led by a council of elders, a war chief, and a general chief. However, this varied by village and sometimes several chiefs were present. Leaders acted as a council, with no chief outranking others, and holding their position on the basis of ability, experience, success, courage, etc. Religion did not have its own distinct sphere in Huron society, rather, it was a part of all Huron beliefs and practices; “to them, their religion and way of life were one and the same” (Trigger, 1976:75). Consequently, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society. The Huron did not have religious specialists (e.g. a shaman or priest position), rather, chiefs often held ritual offices and duties in addition to their secular roles. The religion did not have a well-defined pantheon of supernatural beings, but the most important deity is the sky, serving as a present but otiose high god. Also present are previously human spirits, but these beings are not discussed in extensive ethnographic details. Non-human supernatural beings include Iouskeha and Aataentsic (two of the most important, best-personified, and most described beings), as well as  “… animate spirits [that] resided in the earth, the rivers, lakes, certain rocks, and the sky and had control over journeying, trading, war feasts, disease, and other matters"" (Tooker, 1964:80). Religious observances (e.g. taboos, superstitions) were associated with almost all aspects of Huron life, such as subsistence strategies and life cycle events. Four types of feasts were held, including singing (celebratory) feasts, thanksgiving feasts, curing feasts, and farewell feasts.",1615,1640,907,577,Emily Pitek,1,M.

685,Badjau,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Badjau of Tawi-Tawi Island (also known as the Sama Dilaut) is a subculture of the larger Samal culture. The Badjau group is distinguished by their nomadic, boat-dwelling lifestyle, which consequently allowed for the preservation of their indigenous religious beliefs (which differ from the Islamic beliefs of the land-dwellers). This entry focuses specifically around the time of 1963, “when the traditional culture of these people was still intact” (Nimmo, 1990:4). At this time, Badjau religious beliefs were not distinguished from other aspects of life; this entry therefore considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society at large. Badjau supernatural beings include an otiose high god (Tuhan), non-human spirits (saitan), ancestral spirits (ummagged), vengeful ghosts (pangguah), and a variety of other ghouls/monsters. Religious practitioners known as djin (shamans) communicate with spirits, officiate rites of passage, and serve as ritual leaders. Magic is also present, and include the practices of anting-anting (the wearing of protective amulents), and kabolan (spells and formulas used to being about desired ends such as weather changes). The most important social unit of the Badjau is the nuclear family, which will occasionally come together at moorages to form family alliance units that cooperate for work activities and religious ceremonies. In addition to family alliances, the Badjau recognize about seven localized kin groups (comprised of related family alliance units that regularly moor together). Localized kin groups are led by a headman, and usually contain at least one djin.

This entry focuses on the Sierra Popoluca (the largest of the four groups) living specifically in the town and environs of Soteapan, Veracruz around the time of 1950. This region has a long history of cultural contact with outsiders beginning with the Spanish arrival in the sixteenth century. With the Spanish came Catholic missionaries, who built churches, preached, and converted natives. Consequently, the Popoluca are now nominally Catholic. However, Catholic ideas and practices (including the Christian God and rites such as baptism and marriage) have been blended with indigenous beliefs. Elements of former religion can be seen in the variety of supernatural beings as well as rites and ceremonies associated with agricultural and subsistence practices. Priests occasionally visit the area, but no full-time religious leaders are present otherwise. Magical practitioners known as nawats/nawals are present and practice malevolent magic--these individuals can be described as magical practitioners.

712,Huichol,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Huichol are native inhabitants of what are now the Mexican States of Jalisco, Nayarit, Zacatecas, and Durango. In 1722 the Huichol were conquered by the Spanish, after which Franciscan Missionaries arrived and nominally converted the Huichol to Christianity before leaving the area in the mid 1800’s (Lumholtz, 1973:22). Missionaries left a varying degree of Christian influence across Huichol communities, but at the time this entry focuses on (around 1890) native beliefs were still held and traditional customs and ceremonies were still practiced; the Huichol religion would become more syncretic with Christianity in the 20th century. To the Huichol, religion does not constitute a separate sphere of life; there is no distinction between sacred and everyday life. As such, this entry considers the Huichol religious group to be coterminous with the society itself. Religious practitioners known as shamans are trained in healing, divining, and priestly activities, and communicate with the supernatural. In addition to the spirits of the dead, the Huichol pantheon contains a variety of deities representing personified natural phenomenon such as fire, air, earth, and water. Fire (also known as Grandfather) is said to be the greatest and oldest, existing before the sun (Father). Fire is associated with deer and peyote. The Huichol “petition the deities for sun and rain for the crops, successful deer hunts, fertility, good health, and protection from the dangers of the natural and supernatural worlds” (Schaefer, 2016). The Huichol have an annual cycle of feasts and ceremonies associated with the propitiation of gods, and connected to the agricultural cycle and environmental phenomenon such as rain. Most importantly is the annual journey to sacred (known to the Huichol as híkul͂i), peyote land, where the plant is harvested and later utilized in rituals and to communicate with the gods.",1880,1934,925,577,Emily Pitek,1,M.

There is no central political authority among the Igbo; the largest social unit is the village-group, bound together by ties but each village is functionally independent. In fact, there is “no individual of outstanding power or authority either directly in things spiritual or indirectly in things secular (Green, 1964:49).” Although there are not official religious leaders among the Igbo, there are two types of religious practitioners: priests and dibeas. Hereditary priests observe taboos and lead ceremonies, but are otherwise viewed as “ordinary” members of the community (Green, 1964:53). A dibea, on the other hand, undergoes training and initiation rites to become a specialist in the professions of diviner and/or doctor-magician. Various types of supernatural beings are present. There is belief in a supreme high god who is largely viewed as an otiose creator deity overseeing the world from above, and is not typically worshipped directly. Additionally present are the spirits of deceased humans, and ancestor worship appears to be the concern/responsibility of individual households and families. Several non-human spirits are also present, including village and village-group deities. Larger-scale rituals/ceremonies/celebrations are present, such as the annual rites surrounding the worship of the village-group deity. It is important to note the presence of Christian influence among the Igbo, beginning with the arrival of missionaries in the mid 1800’s.

This entry focuses specifically on the Jahai (alt. sp. Jahay) around the time of 1925, and uses the terms Jahai and Semang interchangeably. The Semang do not possess a formal leadership office, either religious or secular. However, a religious specialist is present, and is called hala’. The hala’ has the special abilities of communicating with the supernatural realm, and serves as medicine-man. An individual becomes hala’ either through a dream, hereditary transmission, or taking possession of the Ćebu stone (which has ritual importance). The term Orang hidop refers to supernatural beings, and is best translated as “the immortals”. The orang hidop include spirits of the dead--who linger for several days but ultimately travel to the realm of the dead--as well as other, non-human beings. Of primary importance is the supreme high god Karei, god of thunder, followed by Ta Pen’n. Also present are Karei’s wife Manoij, their sons and daughter, Karei’s servants, and the Ćenoi (celestial spirit-beings closely related to the hala’). The Semang’s most important religious ritual is the blood sacrifice ceremony, during which individuals must draw and sacrifice their own blood in order to appease Karei either after breaking a taboo, or during thunderstorms to prevent further catastrophes.

In the late 1880’s the Gros Ventre, along with the Assiniboin, were relocated to Fort Belknap Reservation in northern Montana. This entry focuses around the time of 1835-1885, with tribal territory centering around the Milk River, and the Belknap Reservation representing a small portion of Gros Ventre held land. Principal ethnographic authorities use fieldwork, informant accounts, and primary documents to reconstruct Gros Ventre life prior to 1885, which marked the end of the buffalo era and the beginning of consistent missionary contact. The Gros Ventre were traditionally comprised of about 12 bands, each led by a respective chief who was distinguished in war and recognized as the band’s leader. Each band also had a Flat Pipe and a Feathered Pipe Keeper, both of whom served as religious leaders while also possessing political influence. The bands would periodically come together as a tribal unit, which was led by a tribal leader. Ceremonial organization cut across band organization, and most religious ceremonies were held at the tribal level. Gros Ventre political and religious life were interwoven, and this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society at large. Gros Ventre religious beliefs included a Supreme Being, who was considered to be the ultimate ruler and controller of all other supernatural beings, as well as the Earth and its inhabitants. The Supreme Being ranked highest in importance; he was always invoked first and received first offerings. Also present in the superntatural realm were ghosts and ancestral spirit helpers, as well as other non-human supernatural beings like Bha’a, the storm ruler or the thunderbird.",1835,1885,930,577,Emily Pitek,1,M.

729,Kikuyu,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Gikuyu refer to themselves as the “Gikuyu” or “Agikuyu”; “Kikuyu” is their spoken language, and also the name used by British Colonial administration and anthropologists (Davison, 2010). The Gikuyu live in central Kenya in the administrative districts of Kiambu, Fort Hall (Murang’a), Nyeri, Embu, and Meru (as defined in the 1920’s). This entry focuses specifically on the Gikuyu living in the Fort Hall District of Kenya around the time of 1920. By this time, British colonialists held political control over the Gikuyu, and Christian missionaries had arrived in the area. Despite such contact, the Gikuyu culture and religious beliefs at the specific time and place this entry focuses on remains largely traditional. Gikuyu socio/political organization centers around three factors: the family group (mbari/nyomba), the clan (moherega), and an age-grading (riika) system that unites the whole society. The family, led by a patriarch, is the main social, economic, and religious unit. No full-time religious specialists (such as priests or shamans) are present. Rather, ""in religious ceremonies, and in political and social gatherings, the elders hold supreme authority"" (Kenyatta, 1953:263). Elders serve as intermediaries between Ngai (the high god) and ancestral spirits, and maintained communication with these beings (especially through the form of sacrificial ceremonies). The highest status for a Gikuyu man is the religious or sacrificial council (Kiama Kia Maturanguru), which is reached after passing through and being initiated into all age-grades. The religious and sacrificial council are considered “holy men” who are charged with leading all religious and ethical ceremonies. For the Gikuyu, religion is interwoven with all aspects of life; this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society itself.",1895,1930,937,577,Emily Pitek,1,M.

749,Korean shamanism,43,Religious Group (v6),"Korean shamans are often denoted by the term mudang, which encompasses a variety of folk religion practitioners, and other kinds of spiritual consultants. While most Korean scholars, mass media, and public discourse apply mudang to both trance and non-trance practitioners, the terms mansin or kangsin-mu (god-descended mediators) more narrowly denote possessed practitioners. Sesŭp-mu are hereditary practitioners; they do not assert that gods descend into them and were not ordained after sinbyŏng (spirit possession sickness). This kind of initial possession serves as a demonstration that the practitioner was chosen by supernatural entities to be their mediators with people. The term mudang can be applied to both kinds of practitioners because before modern urbanization, regional traditions used to be the main factor that determined which kind of mudang will be common in each place. Although hereditary shamans are not possessed, they still engage with and talk to spirits. Sometimes, they harness the help of a spirit medium who can deliver messages from spirits and gods, although she cannot perform full kut rituals on her own. Furthermore, the dances and songs of this received cultural tradition are significant in terms of artistry because they are learned for many years, sometimes from a very young age. Their artistry has been acknowledged by the South Korean government designation program, as has been also the case with several possessed practitioners, or mansin.

794,Omaha,43,Religious Group (v6),"This entry focuses on the Omaha living in what is now Northeastern Nebraska, around the time of 1860, prior to significant American influence, Christianization efforts, and subjection to the law of the United States. This entry relies primarily on the principal ethnographic authority (Fletcher and La Flesche, 1911), which provides a reconstruction of Omaha life prior to significant cultural changes. As Fletcher and La Flesche (1911) state, “tribal organization of the Omaha was based on certain fundamental religious ideas, cosmic in significance; these had reference to conceptions as to how the visible universe came into being and how it is maintained” (p.134). The prominent religious idea that the authors refer to is Wakónda, which is the invisible and continuous life force that pervades all things both seen and unseen. Wakónda manifests itself in duality: of motion and permanency, of male and female. It is the sense of oneness of the universe. Wakónda is relevant to all aspects of Omaha life, from social and political structure to religious beliefs and practices. Representing the duality of Wakónda, the Omaha were organized into two grand divisions: Inshtacunda, representing the Sky People, and Hongashenu, representing the Earth People. Within each division were five gentes; each gens was an exogamous kin group with distinct rites, tabu, and symbolic characteristics. Each of the two grand divisions had a principal chief; these two chiefs, together with five other chiefs from across the grand divisions, comprised the Council of Seven. The Council of Seven was tasked with the political leadership of the Omaha and duties such as the maintenance of order and decision-making responsibility. Chiefs were favored by Wakónda; chiefs had a special relationship and connection to its unseen powers. In every gens, a particular family held the hereditary right to fill the position of keeper or “priest” who was charged with the gens’ sacred object and associated rites and rituals. As religious leader, the keeper was responsible for conducting ceremonies and rites for his gens. All ceremonies were connected to Wakónda, including both individual and communal practices. Because religious beliefs permeate almost all aspects of Omaha life, this entry considers the Omaha religious group to be coterminous with Omaha society itself.",1840,1880,986,577,Emily Pitek,1,M.

839,19th century German Protestantism,43,Religious Group (v6),"German Protestantism of the 18th and 19th century, mainly in the Lutheran tradition, was a crucible for widely disseminated theology that continues to influence contemporary Christianity. This period was entrenched within the Enlightenment, and very consciously so. The efforts to systematize theological views and biblical interpretation within the new paradigms of scientific progress and Rationalism greatly influenced both institutional and personal piety in this period. The birth of biblical studies within academic institutions was also developed in this period. Particularly, scholars of theology began applying socio-historical criticism to the Bible in ways that drove the theological debates among the elites. As in many societies, elite discourse did not necessarily affect the day-to-day of practitioners immediately, but many of the developments within the academy did find themselves disseminated broadly, particularly as culminated in the popular works of Adolf Harnack at the end of the 19th century.
For most practitioners, their attentions would have been less on the academic debates and more on their immediate socio-political environment. Germany in the 19th century saw many revolutions, such as that of Napoleon Bonaparte, the end of constitutional monarchy of 1919, the revolutions of 1848-1849 (Märzrevolution), the rise of the German Empire, and the industrial revolution, the latter making Germany one of the most powerful nations in Europe. The population grew greatly in this new democracy, creating new opportunities and challenges in itself. Thinkers like Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770-1831) and Karl Marx (1818-1883) greatly influenced the political landscape and fueled ideologies of revolution.
The relationship between the Church and the State also changed greatly in this period. Frederick William III endeavored to unify the Protestant Church. Lutherans, Calivinists, and Reformed congregations made moves to merge their parrishes. Some, particularly the “Old Lutherans,” rejected such moves and emigrated elsewhere to avoid possible sanctions. The United States and Australia were popular destinations for these Lutherans, where they established the “Missouri Synod” and the Lutheran Church of Australia, respectively.
While many people surely went about their lives without notice of the paradigm shifts Germany was experiencing, the net effect of these changes shook the world on the economic, religious, and social levels. A full understanding of Protestant religion today and the formative events of the 20th century on European and American culture (particularly the World Wars), benefits from a comprehension of the 19th century Protestant developments which fed directly into the creation of modernity.",1788,1914,1008,722,Ryan Fitzgerald,18,Robyn Walsh,2020-07-16 11:01:59.669 +0200,2020-08-15 22:51:29.429 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.11142904221384904,0.0002946150097132455,5.975075451822126e-22,0.884534430799012,0.0037419119774256488,6.956328946045256e-32
841,Sa skya,43,Religious Group (v6),"In order to classify Tibetan Buddhism, genuine classification principles have to be applied, e.g. according to the monasteries in which certain schools of Tibetan Buddhism were established, or on the basis of the name of the master to whom a particular school of Tibetan Buddhism is attributed, or according to the preferred spiritual and cultural background of a particular master.

The school is named after the Sakya Buddhist monastery founded in 1073 by Khön Könchog Gyelpo (1034-1102), which is located in Sakya and was called Sakya Densa (sa skya gdan sa) or Sakya Gönpa (sa skya dgon pa) in Tibet.

Kun dga' snyin po (1092-1158), whose studies were mainly devoted to the cycle around Hevajra, the tutelary deity of the Sa skya pa himself.

842,American Evangelicalism,43,Religious Group (v6),"American Evangelicalism is a subset of American Christianity that spans numerous denominational groups including Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians, and Pentecostals among others. A theologically diverse movement, American Evangelicals are often recognized for their emphasis on revivalism and personal religious conversion. The movement lacks a centralized institutional leader, but diverse local, regional, and national networks help reinforce religious authority. 

American Evangelical beginnings can be traced back to the early eighteenth century when a series of religious revivals took place in colonial New England. Preachers like Jonathan Edwards and George Whitefield along with lay leaders like Sarah Osborn preached a version of Christianity that prioritized a personal conversion experience in which individuals became assured of their salvation. By privileging an individual experience, evangelical adherents gained the power to proclaim their faith in God giving some scholars the impression that the movement “democratized” Christianity. While individuals may have gained some authority through this emphasis on a personal religious experience, an individual’s community functioned to help evaluate and verify whether experiences were genuine. 

Revivals and worship services that seek to encourage a conversion experience have been hallmarks of the American Evangelical movement. These large events include singing hymns and preaching and could take place either in a church or outside as with the Cane Ridge Reveal of 1801. Individuals like Dwight Moody, Billy Sunday, and Aimee Semple McPherson carried this revivalistic tradition into the twentieth century. Today, large Mega Churches like Saddleback Church in California effectively turn Sunday worship services into large revivalistic events. Not all American Evangelical churches are large, however, and many have no more than a couple hundred members.

American Evangelicals are incredibly effective institution builders, utilizing technological innovation, print culture, higher education, and marketing tactics to attract new members as well as shape and reinforce their identity. From organizations like the American Tract Society to evangelical Colleges and Universities, American Evangelicals have been successful through constructing institutions and accruing wealth as a result of these institutions. 

Coupled with their institution building, American Evangelicals are also politically active. In the nineteenth century this political activism took the form of moral reform societies, and by the twentieth century, evangelical political activism became more intensely wedded to partisan politics. In 1976, the magazine Newsweek declared it the “Year of the Evangelical” spurred in large part to the election of President Jimmy Carter, a self described “Born Again,” evangelical Christian. American Evangelicals continued to exercise significant political influence in American political life well into the twenty-first century, and overwhelmingly supported the election of Donald Trump in 2016.",1730,2020,1011,728,Andrew Gardner,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-16 18:25:05.960 +0200,2020-08-21 16:57:02.510 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.13052211000670047,0.0006809462061401249,1.0416757989747689e-22,0.8071026703288826,0.061694273458276896,6.285987676303106e-30
843,Bnay Qyāmā and Bnāt Qyāmā,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Bnay Qyāmā and Bnāt Qyāmā (""Sons of the Covenant"" and ""Daughters of the Covenant"" respectively) were Syriac Christian ascetics first attested in the fourth century CE. These individuals, sworn to an ascetic and celibate life, served public and liturgical functions within Syriac churches and communities. Evidence of their activities survives in remarks in a variety of religious treatises and hagiographical texts as well as rules promulgated by religious leaders. This article summarizes the known origins, social significance, and ecclesiastical functions of the bnay/bnāt qyāmā.


The precise social and linguistic origins of the designation are debated. The noun often translated “covenant” (qyāmā) derives from the root qwm (“to stand”), and it has a wide range of meanings, including status, station, oath, and contract. Robert Murray has suggested an origin for the term in baptismal rites, where the catechumen took a proverbial “stand” and rose from the waters (Murray 1974/5). According to another view, the related noun for “resurrection” (qyāmtā) may have played a role in this use of bnay qyāmā (cf. Luke 20:36). Finally, M.R. Macina has argued that the term related to Greek kanon and tentatively proposed that the bnay qyāmā – “members of the [church] institution” – were more integrated into the clerical hierarchy (Macina 1999).


If we are to believe fourth and fifth-century martyr narratives which claim that children of the covenant were targeted in the persecutions of Diocletian and Shapur II, “covenanters” probably existed as pre-monastic ascetic movement in the third century (Harvey 2005, 126). The most important early source is Aphrahat’s sixth demonstration which dates to around 336/7 and describes the renunciatory ideal of the bnay qyāmā. His text, replete with military and athletic imagery, exhorts the children of the covenant to reject the refinements and attachments of the world and instead embrace a spiritual marriage with Christ.


Aside from passing references to the group in hagiographies and church histories, most of our knowledge of the bnay/bnāt qyāmā derives from lists of canons, most notably the rules attributed to Rabbula, bishop of Edessa in 411-32 (see Phenix and Horn 2017), but also in canons attributed to Maruta of Maipherqat in the fifth-century and John of Tella in the sixth-century (see Vööbus 1975 and 1982). These rules prescribe communal and celibate living, either with ones family or with fellow children of the covenant (of the same sex). It can be inferred that vows of poverty were not required based on their prohibition from usury and exemption from collections from priests. Clothing was to be uniform and modest, and outside business and legal entanglements were not allowed. Prayer and fasting were their primary responsibilities, but they also cared for church administration, the staffing of hospitals, and the care of the poor.


One feature of the “covenanters” which distinguishes them from later monastic communities in the west was their central role in public liturgical singing. The bnāt qyāmā were particularly unique in this regard (on which, see Harvey 2005). The fifteenth canon of the synod of Phrygian Laodicea restricted singing in church to these women. According to Jacob of Sarug, Ephrem the Syrian (late 4th c.) established a choir of women to sing his hymns. In this role, they embodied and taught the eschatological and soteriological ideals of the wider religious community. 


By the medieval period the bnay/bnāt qyāmā had declined in importance. On the one hand, the bnāt qyāmā became assimilated with deaconesses and nuns. On the other hand, bnay qyāmā were eclipsed by both clerics within the ecclesiastic hierarchy and cenobitic monks. Aside from a smattering of literary references, the bnay/bnāt qyāmā had largely disappeared by the tenth century.

The geographic extent of the bnay/bnāt qyāmā was much broader than the region marked here, namely the Roman province of Osroene in the fifth century, which was chosen both for the sake of simplicity and due to the importance of Edessa as a cultural and religious center. Syriac Christianity and the institution of the bnay/bnāt qyāmā certainly extended into other provinces of the Roman empire and the Persian empire to the east.",300,900,1012,724,Jonathan Warner,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-16 19:20:53.242 +0200,2020-08-15 19:03:19.860 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.10289570404474999,0.0027358469064437934,0.7991461272260284,0.09521348226147294,8.839561304797324e-06,2.7515748570704356e-34
849,"""Gaiwiio Religion,"" ""Longhouse Religion,"" or ""The Way of Handsome Lake"" of the Seneca Tribe",43,Religious Group (v6),"""Gaiwiio,"" ""The Way of Handsome Lake,"" or simply ""The Good Message,"" is a new religious movement that emerged among the Seneca tribe of present-day northeastern U.S in the early 19th century. It combined moral and theological elements of Protestant Christianity (especially Quakerism) with Iroquois rituals and cosmology. The founder of the movement, Handsome Lake (1735-1815), was from the Seneca tribe--one of the six great nations of the Iroquois Confederacy (1722-1867). The movement, popularly referred to as ""Longhouse Religion,"" remains active today.

In 1799 Handsome Lake, brother to the Seneca war chief Cornplanter, experienced a vision while in a fevered state. This vision marked the beginning of the Gaiwiio religion. While laying bedbound, Handsome Lake pondered the misfortune of his tribe. The Seneca, once a proud Iroquois Nation, had become a broken people during the burgeoning expansion of a young America. Poverty and alcoholism, in particular, had laid waste to his people. As he drifted into sleep, he was visited by three spirits, which made him well again and, additionally, bestowed upon him a message from the Great Creator and commanded him to spread the instruction among his people. 

The Next day, at the Strawberry Festival, a healthy Handsome Lake conveyed this divinely delivered message to all who had attended. The message primarily contained instructions from the Creator on how to order society on earth. It preached against four ""words"" or evils which the people were to avoid: whiskey, witchcraft, love-magic, and abortion or sterility. Those guilty of these acts must repent to Handsome Lake, or, if the transgression was severe enough, to the Creator. From accounts taken by Quakers at the Strawberry festival, we know that this message was well received and that one could ""feel the weight of the Spirit"" and ""the love of God"" present and flowing among the audience (Wallace 1969, 242). 

In the years to come (1799-1801), Handsome Lake would have new visions sent to him by spirits sent on behalf of the Creator. The second essential vision set out an apocalyptic theology for the followers of Handsome Lake. In it, he saw the death of the earth and the eternal fate of the wicked and the good. The sinful suffered at the hands of the Tormentor (or Punisher), while the righteous reunited with the Great Spirit in the Heaven World. A third vision instructed Handsome Lake to spread his Gospel to all Indians. Thus at the end of these three visions, Gaiwiio had its essential form. It was concerned with living righteously on earth for the sake of eternity, fascinated with the inevitable destruction of the planet, and aimed to convert as many Indians as possible to its ranks.",1750,1850,1016,732,James Waters,5,Courtney Fitzsimmons,2020-07-17 22:37:21.359 +0200,2020-07-23 20:44:39.788 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.9036161866006974,0.022577837086604095,1.3285609824319647e-21,0.06815705475535086,0.005648921557347738,4.0742132453629895e-19
851,Sikhism in the United States,43,Religious Group (v6),"Sikhs first immigrated to the United States in 1899 from Punjab. During this time, as they were adapting to life in a new country, religion remained an important factor. In the early 1900s, Sikhs remained adamant in wanting to retain their culture and religion. In a 1910 article, “The Tide of the Turbans,” Herman Scheffauer, a German-American journalist, notes that:

“It was the same son of India who, wishing to become a citizen of the United States, refused to remove his turban while taking the oath and so remained a British subject. Always the turban remains, the badge and symbol of their native land, their native customs and religion. Whether repairing tracks on the long stretches of the Canadian or Northern Pacific railways, feeding logs into the screaming rotary saws of the lumber-mills, picking fruit in the luxuriant orchards or sunny hillsides of California, the twisted turban shows white or brilliant, a strange, exotic thing in the western landscape.”
As decades went by, Sikhs’ mentality about Sikhism adapted. By the mid-1940s, Sikhs at Stockton Gurdwara introduced chairs inside the gurdwara, so worshippers were not required to sit on the floor. The community even dropped the requirements for people to remove their shoes and cover their heads when they enter the gurdwara. If one was to walk inside Stockton Gurdwara, the physical space would resemble the inside of a church more than a gurdwara. Bruce LaBrack notes that this is “because they were better educated and more at ease in the American culture milieu [and] began to question some of the practices associated with Sikh Worship.” Sikh practices were classified by Sikhs of this time as “backward and unnecessarily strict interpretations of gurdwara etiquette,” which is completely different than the terminology and spirit of the first wave of immigrants. With the Immigration Act of 1965 allowing more Sikhs to immigrate to the United States, Sikhism reverted back to its more traditional form. Following the 9/11 attacks, many Sikhs have been victims of hate crimes throughout the United States mainly due to two things: the color of their skin and their turbans. As a matter of fact, the first victim of a hate crime in the aftermath of 9/11 was Balbir Singh Sodhi, a Sikh. Despite the struggle they face in America, Sikhs remain resilient. Today, the number of Sikhs in the United States has grown to over 500,000 with a number of new non-Punjabi converts joining the faith – mainly through the Healthy, Happy, Holy Organization (3HO) started by Harbhajan Singh also known as “Yogi Bhajan.” Throughout the entire history of Sikhs in the United States, their faith continues to be a key component. This section will look at Sikhism in the United States from when they first immigrated in 1899 to the present day.",1899,2020,1018,740,Tejpaul Singh Bainiwal,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-18 18:55:32.157 +0200,2020-07-23 06:20:57.790 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),5.252491715831998e-23,1.5650414017040809e-25,8.212112497780429e-44,0.9970626040995966,0.0029373959004034144,8.810275888013286e-21
852,Pre-Christian Religion / Paganism in Ireland,43,Religious Group (v6),"Historical pagan, pre-Christian Ireland was an autonomous island region of Iron Age Europe inhabited by Celtic language speaking tribes. Encompassing 32,595 square miles, it is situated in close proximity to Britain and the Isle of Man, as well as parts of Continental Europe. 

Prior to the introduction of Christianity in the fifth century CE, the people of Ireland did not typically create written records of any size. A system of writing known as Ogam was designed specifically for the Irish language (an early form referred to as Primitive Irish), created sometime between the late 4th - early 5th centuries, probably in south-west Ireland. It was typically used for memorial stones and dedications, although names and other data were sometimes recorded on personal items. 

Because of the lack of contemporary written source materials - native or foreign - much of our knowledge of the region is obtained through archaeology. Iron Age Ireland was inhabited by numerous tribes, each ruled by a king to whom the people owed their loyalty. 
Society appears to have been hierarchical, and also organized around kin-groups.

In addition to kings and nobles, there were learned professions such as the druid and harpist, as well as skilled craftspeople. The land contained numerous small farmsteads focused on the production of cereal crops and other plant foods and resources, as well as the herding of livestock (primarily cattle).

In addition to archaeology, useful comparisons pertaining to culture and religion have been made with other Iron Age Celtic-speaking cultures in Britain, Gaul, Continental Europe and Galatia (Asia Minor). 

The religion of pre-Christian pagan Ireland consisted of polytheism, with the possibility of animism as well. Our main evidence includes archaeological data pertaining to the location, layout and orientation of ritual sites, votive offerings and depositions, and burial practices, as well as informed analysis of ethnographic accounts of Gaulish religion and belief, including the training and functions of the Druidic class of religious specialists.

Linguistic analysis and comparisons of place-names, personal names, theonyms, and socio-religious terminology from other Celtic regions has proven fruitful, as has examination of possible parallels with religious themes and symbolism from early medieval written sources from Britain, Continental Europe, and Ireland itself.

From the available evidence we can discern a vibrant pagan culture in Iron Age Ireland, whose people attended socio-religious gatherings at local or tribal assembly sites. Depositions of votive offerings were also made into ritual shafts or pits, and bodies of water (rivers, lakes, bogs, ocean).

As in many traditional cultures, religion would have infused nearly every aspect of daily life, and archaeological work has focused on the interconnection between religious spaces, local settlements, and the landscape, as well as cosmological elements. 

In addition to archaeology, early medieval Irish literature is an important potential source of information. While written down after the introduction of Christianity, early Irish law tracts are believed to reflect aspects of native Irish law, elucidating certain aspects of society and culture. These included an appreciation and respect for values such as truth, wisdom, honesty, loyalty and courage, as well as music, eloquence, poetry and skill.

In addition, there are numerous sagas, poems, mythic narratives and onomastic tales which mention supernatural beings referred to as the 'Síabra' or 'Áes Síde,' and later as the 'Túatha Dé Danann' (the 'People or Tribes of the Goddess Danu'). 

While there is considerable scholarly debate about this body of literature and what pre-Christian material it contains or reflects, the sheer volume of it - and the amount of material pertaining to beings expressly described as gods or goddesses (as well as other mythological or visionary material and themes) - must not only be acknowledged but interpreted with some care and discernment. 

According to the literature, there appear to have been numerous Irish deities, whose attributes were associated with aspects of culture (healing, prosperity, warfare, magic, horsemanship, food and drink, arts, crafts, seership and fertility) as well as those with some associations with aspects of the natural world (rivers, wells, trees, groves, animals and birds).

It should be noted that historical Irish paganism was not solely (or perhaps even primarily) an ""earth religion,"" as that term is commonly understood in the 21st century. The attributes of the deities are highly concerned with culture as well as nature, and this appears to be the case in other Celtic regions as well. 

What is extremely prevalent in the archaeological evidence and the literary sources is a focus on interactions and relationships between human beings and the divine, whether that entails deities, ancestors and / or the Otherworld realms. 

If the laws and the literature reflect
any semblance of earlier cultural beliefs and practices, it is reasonably safe to assume that religious ceremonies would have been presided over by members of a highly-trained Druidic class, who probably also served in a judicial capacity. They still had legal status in Ireland at the time of the 7th-8th century CE law tracts, although this diminished over time. 

In Irish, British and Continental written sources, the Druids of history were described as arbitrators, moral and natural philosophers, and experts in the nature of (and communication with) the divine. They appear to have also provided counsel to leaders, performed divination, and engaged in healing rituals. In addition, they served as instructors to druidic candidates over a period of many years, and this training involved a great deal of memorization, as this was an orally transmitted culture. 

In Gaul, the Druids apparently taught the people that the soul was immortal and after death would enter another body, and that the people should ""honour the Gods, do no ill deed, and practice valour."" Early Irish literature provides examples of similar concepts, and much else besides. 

While the debate over the content of the literary sources was in recent memory stalled in a stand-off over 'nativist' and 'non-nativist' stances, in more recent times Celtic Studies has participated in more refined approaches. By engaging with each text in a nuanced and informed manner, and incorporating useful data from interdisciplinary and comparative methodologies, researchers have the potential and capacity to further illuminate the religious beliefs and practices of Iron Age and early medieval pagan Ireland. 

It is important to note that the historically documented training and practices of the Druids in Celtic-speaking regions of Iron Age Europe have little or nothing to do with modern Neo-Pagan druidism or druidry, which are recent occult-based, earth-honoring religions developed in the 19th and 20th centuries.",-500,900,1019,739,Sharon Paice MacLeod,50,Andrew Danielson,2020-07-18 19:09:59.470 +0200,2024-06-05 21:52:03.554 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.4628540873653055,0.4129135749217497,2.1062947446577007e-11,0.07732552839918136,0.04685540900904928,5.140028365111464e-05
854,pre-Christian Irish,43,Religious Group (v6),"Unlike Great Britain and Continental Europe, for which almost everything we know about the pre-Christian religion of the Celtic-speaking peoples comes from either Classical writers or archaeology, Ireland provides us with an abundance of medieval vernacular literature purporting to tell us about the pre-Christian period.  Indeed, the religion of the Irish Iron Age survived to varying degrees well after the introduction of Christianity in the fifth century CE.  Also unlike the Celtic cultures of Britain and the Continent, where the traditional learned class was systematically attacked and suppressed by the Romans, the pre-Christian Irish had a learned class that continued to flourish, maintaining oral historical records, overseeing the legal and educational systems, and carrying out a variety of religious functions.  It is to this learned class that we owe most of our knowledge of the old religion, as their educational system made heavy use of memorization of verse and prose stories, which were thus originally pedagogical, meant to serve as mnemonic devices to help in remembering other knowledge.  These included information about not only the religion but also the natural world, history, proper behavior, and much else.  Because they played a key role in the educational system, they were designed to also be entertaining and thus more easily remembered.  It is probably because of its pedagogical role that this oral material was eventually preserved, written down by scribes based in the Christian monasteries despite its rich pagan content.  Nonetheless, this preservation appears to have been selective, as the scribes would have been inclined to minimize those elements involving the older faith.  The manuscript literature thus provides us with information about many of the deities (Tuatha Dé), but it provides little information on specific beliefs or rituals, although much in the new religion appears to have been compatible with the old.  It has even been suggested that Christianity first gained a foothold in Ireland through its acceptance by the younger members of the learned class, who saw it as offering only a somewhat different perspective on their existing beliefs,   But as a result, the manuscript material must be used carefully as we cannot be certain that elements within it were not invented within the monasteries rather than reflecting true tradition.  A few things do seem clear.  The old religion and its gods were tied closely to the landscape and the annual agricultural cycle.  The gods occupied an invisible Otherworld closely paralleling our own.  And there was a strong belief in reincarnation.  So, to be fair, though there are many hints in the medieval manuscript literature, we really have almost no direct evidence contemporary with the period in question that can provide us with unbiased information about the nature of the religion.  What I have presented here is, therefore, based on my personal evaluation of these early manuscript materials and a scattering of other evidence.  Other scholars may well disagree with my interpretations, as I tend to assume more continuity in beliefs than some others do.  For an in-depth discussion of the issues and difficulties in using this material to reconstruct the pre-Christian religion, see Williams (2016)",-400,900,554,742,Ronald Hicks,9,Ben Raffield,2020-07-18 23:37:03.471 +0200,2022-11-08 23:38:10.999 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),3.014961861569334e-49,9.55860298400442e-17,4.704600736834373e-105,2.86282234602619e-82,6.793689570627176e-15,0.9999999999999931
855,Middle-Class Migrant Muslims in the UAE,43,Religious Group (v6),"The UAE is home to millions of Muslims who exhibit a range of beliefs and practices that reflect the diverse ethnic composition of the country's population. These Muslims are both impacted by local customs and laws governing religion and connected to other places in the world that influence their practice and experiences of religious belonging. In this entry, I provide a general introduction to how religion figures into the lives of middle-class migrant Muslims in the UAE. 

Rather than focus on Emirati citizens, I look at noncitizen residents who have made the UAE their home. This entry is not focused on the working classes of the UAE, employed in sectors like construction or domestic work, nor the ultra-rich, but on migrant Muslims who fall in between the ends of such a spectrum— the people who constitute the UAE’s teachers, doctors, engineers, and business men and women. These men and women are literate, which gives them greater direct access to religious knowledge, and they are educated professionals, which holds implications for their taste and interests in Islam.

While these middle-class migrant Muslims can be mapped across many theological categories, those considered in this entry would generally be categorized as Sunni Muslim. Despite that, their beliefs and practices extend from Salafi inclined, literalist readings of the Quran, hadith, and Islamic tradition to Sufi oriented practitioners who privilege the interior over the exterior.
What characterizes this religious group is their existence and practice of Islam in a state that is not their own. 

Though their religious practice is governed by the UAE, these migrant Muslims do not have a more permanent claim to a long-term presence there. Moreover, they have connections to other places around the world—other religious scholars, sources of authority, and communities—that play a role in their experience of Islam. It is the process of navigating such different pulls that makes this group unique.

As middle-class migrant Muslims, they also have the literary abilities, language skills, technologies, time, and freedom which permits them to access religious knowledge quite independently—by turning directly to scholars online, published books, or attending Islamic classes in one or multiple languages. This capacity to engage an array of Islamic knowledge introduces them to a range of beliefs and practices in the UAE that they likely would not have had access to in their countries of origin. Such particularities hold implications for how they proceed to embrace their faith.",1900,2020,1021,743,Joud Alkorani,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-19 12:16:20.826 +0200,2020-08-13 13:12:54.092 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.39387269098179467,0.0017661135345630615,6.544312045573728e-11,0.602003973099483,0.0023572223187162985,2.82321458728219e-32
857,Wesleyanism,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Methodist/Wesleyan denomination can be said to have commenced in 1738 When John Wesley, an Anglican pastor,  had an experience of the Holy Spirit on the road to Aldersgate in the outskirts of London. He wrote in his Journal, following the teachings of Martin Luther on righteousness that, “I felt my heart strangely warmed. I felt I did trust in Christ, Christ alone, for salvation; and an assurance was given me that He had taken away my sins, even mine, and saved me from the law of sin and death.”  One of the distinctive features of Methodism/Wesleyanism is what has become referred to as its “quadrilateral;,” the four sources of ecclesiastical authority. These consist of scripture, tradition, experience, and reason. This supplements the Anglican threefold sources, which consist of scripture, tradition, and reason.
To the traditional Reformation doctrines of salvation by faith alone (sola fide) and justification by faith, and antinomianism, John Wesley added certain maxims that distinguished his movement from the larger Reformation tradition. Acutely among them was his notion of perfection in love in the earthly life. This notion is rooted in 1 John:1 12, 17, Hebrews 12:1f., and Matthew 5:48. Christians are to be perfect as their heavenly father is, especially in love. Additionally, Wesley emphasized a doctrine known as “Arminianism” (named for the Dutch theologian Jacobus Arminius), a rebuke to the Calvinist notion of predestination. Additionally, he stressed the “means of grace” that include of piety, mercy, as well as social and communal practices. With Calvin, Wesley emphasized the “real presence” of Christ in the Eucharistic elements; against Calvin he prescribed an open Communion—even the unbaptized are welcome at the Table of the Lord (he referred to Communion as a potential “converting ordinance.” Another chief ordinance is Holy Baptism, performed either in childhood or in adulthood. The United Methodist Book of Worship contends, “The Baptismal Covenant is God's word to us, proclaiming our adoption by grace, and our word to God, promising our response of faith and love.” Wesley also borrowed the concepts of prevenient grace, original righteousness, and sanctification from other Christian traditions.
Wesley’s closest associates were his brother Charles (primarily known for his proficient hymnody) and George Whitefield (himself a Calvinist who believed in predestination), as well as his mother, Susannah who was his foremost spiritual consort. Methodism/Wesleyanism gave birth to the Holiness Movement, which in turn gave birth to Pentecostalism. The Church of Jesus Christ, Latter Day Saints, was formed by a former Methodist. Methodist/Wesleyan denominations today include the United Methodist Church (primarily in the United States but with a large following in sub-Saharan Africa), the Church of the Nazarene, the British Methodists, the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the African Methodist Episcopal Church, Zion, and merged, united denominations in Canada, Zambia, and Australia. Most denominations have an episcopal, connexional polity – a bishop presides over larger collections of congregations, a superintendent over more local collections, and an ordained elder over individual (or multiple) local churches. Lay participation is encouraged.",1738,2020,1097,750,Tasi Perkins,43,Quinn Clark,2020-07-20 18:43:00.735 +0200,2023-02-25 05:31:37.919 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.1478839077449343,6.474273580412103e-06,2.5754400494217023e-33,0.8153114475203054,0.03679817046117994,3.041234782769176e-30
859,Valentinians,43,Religious Group (v6),"Valentinians are an early branch of Christian practitioners that have often been labeled as ""gnostic."" They are generally understood to be Christians who were influenced by the teachings of Valentinus, a second-century teacher and preacher in Rome. Valentinian Christians are best-known for their treatment of God as totally unknowable before Jesus's appearance, their conception of God as a collective entity of Aeons or emanations of the divine, and their belief in a heavenly counterpart that one needed to reunite with.

Our sources for Valentinian thought are split between their own writings and those of their opponents. Until the 20th century, most of our knowledge of the Valentinians came from heresiologists like Irenaeus of Lyons and Tertullian of Carthage, who wrote tractates that stereotyped and condemned their theologies and practices. We also had a few fragments of Valentinus’s own writings and a letter from the Valentinian Ptolemy to Flora embedded in other patristic texts. With the discovery of the Nag Hammadi Codices in the 1940s, we gained access to a broad array of Valentinian texts. These texts gave us a better understanding of Valentinian liturgical practices, exegetical concerns, and cosmological narratives. 

Valentinians have been condemned as heretics since the late second century. However, Valentinus himself was never formally condemned during his lifetime, nor was there any mechanism by which to expel him from the Roman churches in the second century. Valentinians often accused of looking “too much” like other types of Christians and attending the same services, which made them a threat to some Christians who feared that they were duplicitous.

Valentinians writings and theological explorations have often been depicted as having two substantial trajectories, known as the Eastern and Western schools. However, recent scholarship has questioned a clear divide between the two schools. Likewise, scholars have recently questioned how “Valentinian” Valentinus himself was, since the cosmological and theological concerns of second- and third-century Valentinian writers often turn in very different directions than the fragments of Valentinus that have been preserved. 

Perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of Valentinian thought if their conception of God as androgynous, and that the various emanations of God exist in male-female dyads. This conception of God’s completeness as based on twoness is also expressed in Valentinian descriptions of union with the divine, in which one joins with their accompanying angel in the ritual of the “bridal chamber” in order to achieve redemption.",135,400,6,754,Chance Bonar,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-20 18:57:41.614 +0200,2020-07-26 15:32:09.210 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),9.775387412731485e-52,1.982655789308953e-28,1.763523470606641e-98,2.97382930028755e-83,1.1245059615062618e-14,0.9999999999999887
860,Kimpa Vita,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Antonian Sect (Antonianism) is a religious movement initiated by Dona Béatrice Kimpa Vita, a young enlightened Kongolese leader, from the eighteen century. This religious  movement advocated for the restoration of the kingdom of Kongo through a spiritual approach grounded on local beliefs and practices, and the rejection of western (missionary) beliefs system perceived as ideological and deleterious to the unity and greatness of the kingdom of Kongo. Kimpa Vita believed that God was not white. She also believed that she was the reincarnation of saint Anthony and used these claims to promote the restoration of a unified and powerful Kingdom of Kongo. The deeper issue behind Kimpa Vita's claims was the idea of ""inculturation"" i.e. christian ideals and values must be understood and interpreted through Kongolese cultural paradigms in order to restore and strengthen the unity of the Kongolese kingdom. Her teaching attracted many followers and ultimately became a threat to the missionaries. She was burnt alive by missionaries in 1706. Despite her death and the collapse of the kingdom of Kongo, Kimpa Vita's spiritual and political intuitions (ideas) are embraced by many African and Congolese people who still perceive her as a prefigure to inculturation and Afrocentrist movements. Nowadays, Kimpa Vita's movement continues in a different way through the ""Ngunza religion"" from Congo-Brazzaville. The Ngunzas venerate and practice a ritual dedicated to Kimpa Vita.

869,Sichuan Esoteric Buddhist Cult,43,Religious Group (v6),"Shortly after Emperor Wu 武 of the Tang dynasty initiated the Huichang 會昌 Suppression of Buddhism in 842 CE, Tang Esoteric Buddhism lost the imperial patronage and fell into decline. While esoteric Buddhist activities suffered severely in the capital Changan, it was believed that a lay Buddhist named Liu Juzhi 柳居直 (855-907, also known as Liu Benzun 柳本尊, “the principle master Liu”) received the transmission of esoteric Buddhist teachings, especially the incantations efficacious in curing diseases and eliminating evil spirits, and devoted himself to spreading his teachings in Yizhou 益州 (nowadays Chengdu 成都) and surrounding areas. 

Grottoes related to Liu Benzun’s esoteric Buddhist cult were built in Anyue 安岳 and Dazu 大足 county in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Both the Pilu 毗盧 (Vairocana Buddha) Cave in Anyue and the niche 21 of Mt. Baoding 寶頂 (Summit of Jewels) in Dazu preserved large-scale tableaux depicting ten scenes of Liu Benzun’s self-mutilation. Chinese scholars argue that the tableau in Dazu was produced later than the tableau in Anyue as a remodeled version of it. Mt. Baoding, as a prominent part of the Dazu Rock Carvings (listed as a World Heritage Site), was famous for a series of grottoes presenting varied themes of Buddhist teachings. According to the entry from a Southern Song geographical guidebook and the inscriptions from two Southern Song steles preserved at Mt. Baoding, these grottoes belonged to Buddhist practitioner Zhao Zhifeng's 趙智鳳 (1159-1249) carving project, which aimed at propagating esoteric Buddhist teachings inherited from his patriarch Liu Benzun as well as the secular value of filial piety. Evidence of this carving project’s emphasis on the esoteric tradition can be found as the inscription in niche 21, which writes Liu Benzun’s honorific title as “the supreme master of Tang Esoteric Buddhism.” 

Due to the lack of extant historical texts, the study of Liu Benzun’s esoteric Buddhist cult was limited to the analyses of stele inscriptions, sculptures, and stone relief carvings. Most scholars hold the opinion that, contrary to the statement claimed in his biographical inscriptions, Liu Benzun did not obtain an orthodox transmission from Tang esoteric Buddhist patriachs. Moreover, scholars remain skeptical about the account of Zhao Zhifeng’s studying at the major practice hall of Liu’s teachings. Based on interpretations of the carvings at Mt. Baoding, scholars suggest that Zhao established this site as a cultic center where the cult of the deified lay Buddhist Liu Benzun was integrated with Mahayana Buddhist traditions, Confucianism, and Daoism. 

The stone inscription and tableaux preserved in Anyue and Dazu areas illustrated that the esoteric Buddhist cult prevalent in the Sichuan area from Late Tang to Southern Song was a regional Buddhist cult with distinctive doctrines and practices which embodied an amalgamation of Tang esoteric tradition, exoteric Buddhist traditions, and local beliefs.",855,1279,1031,730,Yi Liu,45,Matthew Hamm,2020-07-22 11:02:32.389 +0200,2020-08-02 13:00:08.553 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.18645080701328834,0.00489096348825323,0.647121966644858,0.16148439340159518,5.1869452005307784e-05,1.9648854278186365e-22
870,Postsocialist Mongolian Buddhism,43,Religious Group (v6),"Before the socialist period (1921-1990), Buddhism was the main religion in Mongolia. In 1936, before the violent religious purges of the late 1930s there were around 767 monasteries in Mongolia and somewhere between 75,000 and 100,000 lamas (robed monastics) in the country. By 1940 there were 251 lamas left in the country, an estimated 14,000 having been killed during the period. Following these purges of the late 1930s, religious activities of all kinds were severely restricted during the socialist period. Only one monastery, Gandantegchenlin Khiid was allowed to operate in Mongolia’s capital city, Ulaanbaatar. Due to active repression during the socialist period, most of the attendees of this temple were the elderly, particularly older women. In the winter of 1989-1990, Mongolia, dialoguing with broader democratic movements in the socialist world, had a Democratic Revolution. Following the revolution, religious freedoms were ensured and people once again began to practice religion in public. Since 1990, Buddhism has become one of the main religions in Mongolia, mostly following the Vajrayāna tradition. Although it shares many similarities with other Vajrayāna schools, in particular the Gelug and Nyingma lineages, Buddhism in Mongolia has unique characteristics that come from its local religious heritage, Mongolian beliefs systems and translocal organised religious groups, both Buddhist and non-Buddhist. Following the lifting of religious restrictions at the start of the democratic period, Mongolian lamas who had been lamas before the socialist purges once again donned robes and began to practice in public. These lamas reinhabited old temples and built new ones and began to take on new students. These lamas set about reinvigorating old traditions that had been kept alive in secret during the socialist period or remembered from their youth. At the same time as local practices were re-emerging, transnational Buddhist organisations (mostly from the Vajrayāna lineages) came to Mongolia to assist local efforts to re-establish Buddhism in the country. Many young novices were encouraged to go to India to study at monasteries connected to Tibetans in diaspora. Postsocialist Buddhist practice in Mongolia has also been characterized by the growth of other ritual practices and translocal religious traditions. These include local ritual practices, such as Mongolian shamanism, that have been gaining in popularity during the democratic period, and translocal religious traditions, such as Christianity and new religious movements. Buddhism in the contemporary period, as was the case in the presocialist period, has geopolitical significance. Its historical ties to Tibet and the Dalai Lama have been the source of geopolitical tensions with China. The relationships between Tibetans in diaspora and international organizations have internally affected Mongolian Buddhist hierarchies as well as lay Buddhist beliefs.",1990,2020,1032,751,Saskia Abrahms-Kavunenko,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-22 11:14:36.549 +0200,2020-07-27 10:10:23.768 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.5496958254173642,0.00910657554416241,1.553161194236267e-11,0.06399455825149526,0.3772030407714399,6.755644980912523e-15
873,The Branch Davidians,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Branch Davidians were a millenarian sect active in the United States from 1960’s through 1993. The group developed out of a Seventh-Day Adventist offshoot called the Davidian Adventists, which believed itself to be the pure remnant of a now-global Adventist church that had grown lax and sinful. In contrast to Adventist understandings that the Kingdom of God would come about through a spiritual transformation of the world, the Davidians taught that the Kingdom of God would be physically established by a second Christ in the modern-day land of Palestine. In 1935, the Davidians moved to a large farm in Waco, TX, from which they proselytized (mainly by mail) about the imminent return of Christ.

After the death of Davidian founder Victor Houteff in 1955 (and after Christ failed to materialize on the day that Houteff’s widow predicted in 1959) the group began to splinter, and by the early 1960’s it re-coalesced around members Ben and Lois Roden, who both eventually assumed the mantle as prophets and renamed the group the “Branch Davidians.” In 1981, a recent convert named Vernon Howell began to stake claims to the prophetic role that Lois Roden still held. Out of the power struggles that followed Roden’s death in the mid-1980s, Howell emerged the clear leader of the Branch Davidians. After a trip to Israel where he claimed to have had a vision of angelic forces, in 1990 he legally changed his name to David Koresh and began to teach that he was a second Christ sent to complete the mission that Jesus had started by ushering in the end of days. 

Koresh and a group of over 100 followers lived communally at Mount Carmel, their compound in Waco, Texas. There, members participated in lengthy daily Bible studies led by Koresh. They believed that he had been sent by God to reveal the full meaning of the Christian Bible, and in particular, to unfold the narrative of the imminent apocalypse. They believed the apocalypse would be triggered by a conflict between the Branch Davidians and the forces of “Babylon” that would take place in the land of Palestine at some point in the near future. Aiming to purify themselves in preparation for the end of days, they sought to live as a perfect community; they came to see themselves as a divine family, with adults spiritually married to Koresh and all of the children spiritually his – and many of them biologically his own, as well. 

In the spring of 1993, when federal agents – legally spurred by an arrest warrant for Koresh on weapons charges, but also deeply motivated by fears driven by the anti-cult movement – began a violent siege on the group’s compound. After 51 days, the compound went up in flames, killing 76 Branch Davidians, including Koresh. The movement was effectively ended, though some believers survived, and though some other groups have risen up to claim the name of Branch Davidian. Some elements of life at Mount Carmel remain contested to this day, with conflicting reports from members and disaffected ex-members emerging during and after the siege.",1962,1993,1035,738,Joanna Smith,5,Courtney Fitzsimmons,2020-07-22 17:05:48.732 +0200,2020-08-16 15:07:18.828 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.10289570404474999,0.0027358469064437934,0.7991461272260284,0.09521348226147294,8.839561304797324e-06,2.7515748570704356e-34
879,Free Methodist Church,43,Religious Group (v6),"A Christian denomination in the Wesleyan/Holiness tradition which broke away from the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1860. The major issue leading to the split concerned disagreements over slavery. The Methodist Episcopal Church (MEC) still had many slaveholders after the schism in 1844 saw the creation of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South (MEC, S). Official church policy recognized slaveholding as sin, but in practice had accepted the reality of the practice and attempted to justify it under several theories (e.g., paternalism toward slaves, keeping slaveholders in the church). Roberts and other abolitionists saw this compromise as a violation of the ethical precepts of Christianity and their Wesleyan heritage (John Wesley had was an abolitionist in Britain). However, the direct cause of the formation of the Free Methodist Church was a series of political maneuvers in Roberts’ home conference which saw Roberts and several other pastors expelled from the MEC. There is a split in the scholarship as to whether Robert’s abolitionist views lead to the political maneuvers or was merely one view amongst many that angered important parts of the church’s hierarchy (see Snyder, 406-7).
	Upon establishing the new denomination, Roberts ended the practice of ‘pew renting’ by which wealthy individuals could ‘rent’ a pew in church with better visibility, both for and of themselves. He also ended instrumental music in churches, not on grounds against such music, but against the practice of paying trained musicians out of the church’s funds which could have gone to other needs. Like much of the holiness tradition of the nineteenth century, simplicity was a virtue.
Currently, the church has less than 100,000 members in the United States but totals more the one million total members worldwide. It is episcopal in organization with three bishops, each based in the USA. The church is connected to five universities in the United States: Roberts Wesleyan in New York, Spring Arbor in Michigan, Greenville University in Illinois, Central Christian University in Kansas, and Seattle Pacific in Washington; and another four internationally. The church is also affiliated with several non-denominational schools, including Azusa Pacific in California, and Asbury University and Asbury Theological Seminary in Kentucky.
The Free Methodist Church fits nearly all definitions of ‘evangelical’ and members are generally theologically and politically conservative (in the USA) though the latter has more diversity among congregants. Among the other Wesleyan related churches, Free Methodists are most similar in theology to the Church of the Nazarene and the conservative (sometimes called ‘traditional’) wing of the United Methodist Church due to their teachings of both progressive and instantaneous sanctification at some point after justification. This experience has many names from different theologians but most use the terms ‘Entire Sanctification’ or ‘Second work of grace’ to describe it.",1860,2020,1103,773,Steven Lane,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-22 19:27:44.688 +0200,2020-08-11 17:21:08.721 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),2.3082013841864856e-24,2.1874881306900034e-26,4.146524534084164e-34,0.9999965320437325,3.4679562674509446e-06,3.2033041889398935e-34
880,Egyptian Salafism (inluding North Africa and West Asia),43,Religious Group (v6),"Salafis' main aim is to practice Islam as the ""pious predecessors"" (al-salaf al-salih) of Prophet Muhammad practiced it. This means overlooking or even shunning any practice or belief that is deemed an accretion to what the earliest Muslims did or believed. Salafi thought is often linked to the Saudi Arabian thinker Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab, but scholarship suggests that the movement has roots in 19th century Islamic Egyptian thought. Traces of Salafi practice and belief can be found worldwide.
The main sources of Sunni practice and beliefs are the Qur'an, the normative example of the Prophet Muhammad (sunna) and the lifestyle of the early generation of Muslims. 
The intellectual roots of the movement lie in the thought of the eighteenth-century Arabian thinker Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhab (d.1791). A man of little traditional religious training, Ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhab nonetheless sought to rectify what he perceived to be the unlawful accretions to Islam and Islamic practice that he observed in his people in what is today Saudi Arabia. He wanted to eliminate the practice of venerating saints and sought to place tawhid (the belief in Allah’s oneness) at the center of Islamic belief. Any actions that were deemed antithetical to this or were seen as an innovation (bid‘a) were to be condemned and eliminated.  
But the term Salafism is a tricky one. Scholars like Henri Lauzière explain that there are two usages for the term. Although modernists religious scholars like Jamal al-Din al-Afghani (d. 1897) and Muhammad ‘Abduh (d. 1905) did not actually call themselves Salafi, they are often credited with having spearheaded the movement in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. These “Modernist Salafis,” as Lauzière calls them, strove to “rearticulate their religion in terms that were more relevant to contemporary realities and more intelligible and appealing to the rational minds of the educated elite.”  Like Ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhab, they viewed the immediate followers of Prophet Muhammad (al-salaf al-salih) as the exemplars of pious Islam. They were thus committed to the example of the salaf and to the text but did not believe that this should be a hindrance on their ability to adapt aspects of the law to help the Muslim world (umma) move forward in the ever-changing, modernizing world.  
“Purist Salafis,” on the other hand, are exclusionary in that they view that theirs is the only form of Islam that could lead to salvation. It is the pure Islam of the salaf, “unsullied by any innovation, deviation or accretion and uncontaminated by exogenous influences” that should be followed by all.  Lauzière argues, however, that, in the beginning, Purist Salafism did not completely reject religious compromise. Between the 1920s and the 1950s, leading Salafi activists “modified their understanding of Islamic reform…mainly to accommodate political considerations and to increase the likelihood of achieving political independence from colonial powers.”  They thus constructed a rigorist form of Salafism that emphasized purity but sought to unite and gain a following throughout the Muslim world.  Post-independence, however, Purist Salafis no longer had to downplay their exclusionary vision of Islam. This form of Salafism “responded to the challenge of modernity by escaping to the secure haven of the text, but it treated rational moral insight as fundamentally corrupting of the purity of the Islamic message,” stunting its growth and ability to respond to modern needs and inquiries.  Despite this, it was the purists who continued to thrive, while modernists, having played their part during the colonial period, fell by the wayside.
States like Saudi Arabia sought to spread this brand of Salafism globally since the 1970s through preachers, funding Salafi mosques and promoting and distributing Salafi texts worldwide.",1870,2015,1038,774,Nareman Amin,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-22 20:54:20.322 +0200,2020-08-03 07:44:07.459 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.9849238422144531,0.014686043366642363,1.9106517646415787e-10,8.551451904527056e-12,0.0003901142192878025,1.6008493291224895e-31
883,Catholics in the People's Republic of China (PRC),43,Religious Group (v6),"This group includes all Catholics in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) (i.e. mainland China, excluding Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau) from its founding in 1949 to the present. It includes believers who participate in the registered (or ""above ground"") part of the church as well as the unregistered (or ""underground"") part of the church, and those in both urban and rural locations.
In 1949, when the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) led by Chairman Mao Zedong defeated the Nationalist Party (KMT), and established the PRC, there were an estimated four million Catholics in China. Whereas the KMT government supported them and had established diplomatic relations with the Vatican, the CCP (even before 1949) had begun to persecute Catholics as agents of foreign imperialism. Broader CCP efforts to eradicate all religion in favor of Marxist atheism began in the 1950s. Fr. Beda Chang (Zhang Boda 张伯达), the first Catholic martyr under CCP rule, was martyred in 1951. After resisting CCP pressure, a large group of Catholics in Shanghai, including its first Chinese bishop, Ignatius Kung Pin-mei (Gong Pinmei 龔品梅), was arrested in 1955. 
In 1957 the government established the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association (CCPA), a government body responsible for ensuring compliance with the demand that the Church in China must be “independent” and self-sustaining, with no official ties to the Vatican or the Pope. A percentage of clergy accepted these demands, and formed the state-approved official, or “above-ground” church, while the majority of Catholics, who rejected these demands as incompatible with the Catholic faith, became known as the unofficial, or “underground” Church. The CCPA began orchestrating the appointment of bishops without papal approval, which continued until 2018, when a controversial agreement between the Holy See and the PRC government was signed. Since 2018, the government has continued to pressure underground clergy to agree to a separation, or “independence” from the Holy See.
During the Cultural Revolution (1966-76), all perceived political enemies of Mao were persecuted, and believers of all religions, including official and underground Christians were killed or suffered mental or physical mistreatment. After Mao’s death, official churches reopened, but still under the CCPA’s oversight. To the surprise of many, the number of Christians had grown during these silent years, and continued to expand from the 1980s to the present. Today China has an estimated 10-12 million Catholics, and many more Protestant Christians.",1949,2020,1132,777,John Lindblom,45,Matthew Hamm,2020-07-23 02:02:18.430 +0200,2021-09-29 20:35:45.217 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),7.646939714873541e-12,2.704846153167058e-13,5.929048892029196e-11,0.9999743513171672,2.5648615624897284e-05,6.612819503799652e-34
884,Sub Saharan Africa Pentecostalism,43,Religious Group (v6),"European missionaries brought Christianity to Sub Saharan Africa with the goal of converting the population of the region. They were indeed successful in that the local population took Christianism and made it their own. Hence was born African Independent Churches in the early twentieth century leading later to the Pentecostal movement. After the wave of independences from colonial rule in the 1960s, the independent churches thrived until the 1970s when the Pentecostal movement which was at that point an underground movement became full blown. It is now becoming the dominant form of Christianity in Africa attracting converts from all religions, tribal and ethnic groups, and all walks of life. 

The movement is defined by the day of Pentecost and refers to the encounter with God in the Bible’s book of the Acts of the apostles. Pentecostals believe they receive an impartation of God’s spirit when they confess the name of Jesus. Its main pillars are the concept of being born again, the baptism of the Holy Spirit, speaking in tongue, the divine healing, the eschatological belief of the return of Jesus Christ, and all wrapped in the concept of the full gospel. First, the concept of ‘born again’ refers to a spiritual birth of an individual which in the African context connect the person to the invisible world. Second, the baptism of the Holy Spirit is a Christian concept of spiritual empowerment which is also found in African spiritual belief which gives the person a spiritual awareness and discernment. Third, the divine healing mimics African belief that a person can be supernaturally healed in opposition to modern medicine. Finally, the return of Jesus Christ is similar to African eschatological belief that there is an invisible world out there which controls the visible world.

 In fact, African cosmology assumes two worlds: one which is invisible and populated with spirits and the other which is the visible world. The interaction between the invisible and visible worlds determines human’s faith. Pentecostals practice exorcisms where evil spirits are cast out followed with weeping, laughing, and screaming. They engage in what is known as spiritual warfare, praying, and fasting. These beliefs are ingrained in Africans’ psyche and were comfortably found in Pentecostal belief generating what is known as African Pentecostalism. It gives people a sense of self, meaning, and reconcile years of exploitation with the newfound identity. It encourages free enterprise, hard work, and self-determination.",1907,2022,1041,744,Azizou Atte-oudeyi,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-23 02:16:24.816 +0200,2022-05-08 00:54:56.460 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.10289570404474999,0.0027358469064437934,0.7991461272260284,0.09521348226147294,8.839561304797324e-06,2.7515748570704356e-34
885,Contemporary West African Vodun,43,Religious Group (v6),"The word Vodun means spirit in Fon and Ewe, two languages spoken in coastal Benin, Togo, and South East of Ghana. The Vodun religion is an ancestral religion common to the population living in the west African coastal corridor covering the countries mentioned above. The deities comprise of the supreme god and intermediary gods who cover different domain of life. The supreme god is known as ‘Mawu’, a benevolent god who has the control of the whole universe. The Vodun religion in its encounter with imported religions was associated to a demonic religion and continues to lose membership due to the westernization of the region. The contemporary Vodun religion evolves in an environment where most members practice syncretism with Islam and Christianism and most members are secretive in their allegiance to the Vodun gods.
For contemporary Vodun worshippers, the supreme god Mawu is most of the time assimilated to a monotheist god. Depending on the tribe, Mawu is either a female or a male or both. Mawu plays a moderator role in that all the intermediary gods’ actions are controlled. Below Mawu, there are seven intermediary divinities. These intermediary gods are active in everyday life and play a role in their domain. Sakpata is the god of the Earth. Hêbioso is the thunder god. Agbe is known as the god of the sea. Gû represents the god of war. Agê is in the domain of agriculture. Finally, Lêgba is the unpredictable god and serves as the contact point with the other gods. The ambivalence of modern worshippers is mostly visible in the rituals and sacrifices made to these gods in order to change the course of life in the changed world. Though some of Vodun priests can be found in the inner cities, the majority are located in rural area reinforcing the mystery and secrecy that surround them and their practitioners. Blood sacrifices, incantations, rituals, and the confinement of children and women in Vodun convents are some of the practices of this religion. 
Contemporary Vodun practitioners have adapted their religion to their time. With the introduction of monotheist religions, Vodun was predicted to disappear. Instead, Vodun continues to survive and has expanded to the diaspora where the Vodun has become an identity issue for former African slaves’ descendants in the Caribbean islands and the Americas. Even in contemporary West Africa, Vodun is used to affirm the African identity of its members in comparison to African Muslims and Christians.",-1960,2022,1071,744,Azizou Atte-oudeyi,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-23 04:06:38.102 +0200,2022-05-08 00:53:49.335 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.1717607297113643,0.0026928499074311187,4.3051639981851146e-11,0.8254636246269723,8.27957111806772e-05,4.000383796659122e-33
886,Pushtimarg (The Path of Grace) in the UK and Gujarat,43,Religious Group (v6),"Pushtimarg was developed by Vallabhacarya (1479–1531 CE), a Vedic philosopher who emphasised the Bhagavad Purana (a religious text of Hinduism). As a form of North Indian bhakti (devotion), the sampradaya follows Krishna as Shrinathji (as well as his other forms though focus is on his childhood). Vallabhacarya did not preach a life of asceticism or renunciation. His monistic philosophy was called Shuddhadvaita (pure non-dualism) where the focus is on the Supreme Being as personal, with the potential of developing a relationship. The Pushtimarg is a householder sampradaya (community) and therefore generating wealth and having a family are important parts of Krishna's world that he created for his lila (play). 

Historically, the popularity of the bhakti movement in India was twofold; “One the one hand, bhakti bypassed the hierarchy and ritualism of the Vedic sacrifices, monopolised by Brahmans and sponsored by their wealthy twice-born patrons, by teaching that salvation was open to all, regardless of caste, wealth, or sex, through the sincere and spontaneous expression of love for the divine. On the other hand, bhakti provided a more practicable alternative to the disciplined path followed by the renouncer” (Bennett 1993; 2). 

The community is dispersed globally, from Mozambique to Australia. In the 1990s, Pushtimarg gurus (who are called goswamis and are descendants of Vallabhacharya)  began to travel more frequently to the diasporas around the US and Europe though this trend came relatively late compared to other forms of North Indian Krishna worship (e.g. Hare Krishna or ISKCON and the Swaminarayan faith).",1990,2020,1042,779,Anishka Gheewala Lohiya,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-23 10:10:41.156 +0200,2023-04-08 21:03:34.159 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.10289570404474999,0.0027358469064437934,0.7991461272260284,0.09521348226147294,8.839561304797324e-06,2.7515748570704356e-34
887,Postsocialist Mongolian Shamanism,43,Religious Group (v6),"Shamanism has co-existed with Buddhism for many centuries in the Mongolian cultural region. Shamanic practices pre-date the arrival of Buddhism in the region which first became a state religion during the reign of Chinggis Khan’s grandson Khubilai Khan (r. 1260–1294). Shamanic practices and shamans have been the subject of religious oppression both by Buddhist institutions and more recently during the socialist period (1921-1990). Since the Democratic Revolution of 1989-1990, shamanism is once again allowed to be practiced in the public sphere. Since 1990 there has been a significant increase in the number of shamans and shamanic ceremonies in Mongolia. Shamanism in Mongolia differs from shamanism further north in Siberia due to the types of spirits that are channelled. Siberian shamans religious practices tend to be more animistic, channelling spirits as anthropologist Morten Pedersen puts it, ‘horizontally’. Mongolian shamans, on the other hand, channel ancestor spirits ‘vertically’. These are human spirits located within social hierarchies. Mongolian shamans typically communicate with an allied spirit or an ‘ongon’ who are the spirits of deceased human beings, generally within the shaman’s family. These spirits are historically located, reflecting specific genealogies. The presence of other spirits in the landscape is accepted by shamans, however it is not generally the focus of their ritual practice. Novice shamans are often found during shamanic ceremonies. Shamans can be recruited through extensive illnesses for which no cure can be found or other difficulties. Some men can become trapped in a semi-shamanic like state characterised by aggression and alcoholism which is known as ‘agsan’. Once a shaman establishes a relationship with an ongon they should carry out regular ceremonies and ritual offerings to maintain the relationship. Shamanic spirits don’t tend to provide eschatological or ontological answers, rather they provide advice for success in this life. Mongolian shamans enter a trance state without the use of drugs. They wear heavy clothing and a corded mask. Drumming and dancing is part of the trance state. Some shamans identify as yellow shamans as their practices include Buddhist elements.",1990,2020,1043,751,Saskia Abrahms-Kavunenko,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-23 12:49:33.516 +0200,2020-07-25 09:59:40.904 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.6067231742961549,0.01012255398496715,1.7655484051342546e-11,0.07274550167582729,0.31040877002539313,2.1838060205408835e-15
888,Céli Dé monks,43,Religious Group (v6),"Christian monastic communities of strict observance, characterised by Sabbatarianism, concerns for ritual purity, constant spiritual surveillance, and a strong sense of in-group distinctiveness in the face of other laxer communities. In general, the term refers to communities influenced by the teachings of saint Máel Ruain, abbot of Tallaght, Co. Dublin (obit 792). From Tallaght, four written sources are extant: the Old Irish Penitential, the Martyrology of Tallaght, the Martyrology of Óengus, the Stowe Missal and possibly a hymn in honour of Saint Michael. Additionally, it is likely the Old Irish Table of Penitential Commutations emerged from Tallaght as well, as a complement to the Penitential. From Terryglass (Co. Tipperry), a community headed by Máel Ruain’s disciple Máel Díthruib, is extant the so-called “Tallaght Memoir” (in three recensions: the “Monastery of Tallaght,” the Rule of the Céli Dé, and the Teaching of Máel Ruain). An array of other sources may have been influenced by or relevant to the Céli Dé movement (especially, the poems of Blathmac Mac Con Brettan and the Rule of Fothad).   It is unclear whether the different settlements were united in a sort of monastic federation or were independent bodies sharing a common spirituality. The number of the communities is also unclear: the membership of Terryglass is quite certain, as are those of the monastic houses mentioned in the ""Lucht Óentad Maíle Ruain"" (in Leinster and East Munster). The term Céle Dé (while consolidated in academia) is somewhat misleading, as it was employed by religious individuals without Máel Ruain's tradition too. Apparently, they called themselves ""maic bethad"" (Sons of Life) more often than ""Céli Dé"" (Clients or Companions of God). The group was constituted by monks (both ordained and not), nuns, para-monastic married tenants and at least some high-ranking members of the warrior aristocracy (such as Fedelmid mac Crimthainn, who became king of Cashel and over-king of Munster in the ninth century). The Céli Dé were characterised by their high regard for the Old Testament, which was expressed in their strict Sabbatarianism and their concern for ritual purity (sexual, alimentary and death-related taboos). They also enforced a complex and all-encompassing system of spiritual surveillance through detailed and frequent confession, called “anmchairdes” (soul-friendship). The Céle Dé have been studied quite deeply in the past centuries (mostly by Reeves, Hughes, O’Dwyer and Etchingham in the past). The most recent and throrough monograph is Westley Follett’s “Céli Dé in Ireland” (2007).",780,900,1044,749,Exequiel Monge Allen,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-23 17:45:24.016 +0200,2020-07-25 20:29:57.291 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.39387269098179467,0.0017661135345630615,6.544312045573728e-11,0.602003973099483,0.0023572223187162985,2.82321458728219e-32
891,Peruvian Mormons,43,Religious Group (v6),"Peruvian Mormons identify as members of the largest sect of Mormonism, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. They identify as Peruvian either because they were born in Peru or because one or more of their parents or grandparents were. Peru is a highly diasporic nation, and though most Peruvian Mormons live in Peru, many live in the U.S. state of Utah where their church is headquartered. There may be Peruvians who identify as members of sects of Mormonism other than The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, however, none of the participants in the principal anthropological study from whence this data set emerges identify with these sects nor do they know of any Peruvians who do. Importantly, most Peruvian Mormons do not identify as “Peruvian Mormons.” This is partially because their church, on August 16, 2018, expressly directed its membership to eschew the “Mormon” moniker from self-identification, but mostly because the general membership of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints desires to be seen as a global fellowship, not as a set of nationally situated religions with local, syncretic practices. Designating Mormons who happen to also be Peruvian, “Peruvian Mormons” is part of a theoretical intervention that separates the Mormonism happening among Peruvian Mormons in Peru and Utah from the sorts of Mormonism happening among the people Peruvians call ""Anglos"" in order to highlight the unique challenges Peruvians face in navigating a decidedly non-Peruvian organization that was founded upon early colonial U.S. (Anglo) conceptions of race and kinship.",1956,2020,1047,783,Jason Palmer,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-23 22:09:02.836 +0200,2022-11-08 23:40:09.536 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.10289570404474999,0.0027358469064437934,0.7991461272260284,0.09521348226147294,8.839561304797324e-06,2.7515748570704356e-34
892,Charismatic Renewal Movement in Christianity - Second Wave Pentecostalism,43,Religious Group (v6),"For the first six decades of the 20th Century, Pentecostalism was viewed with skepticism and often outright dismissed by other denominations of Christianity. Many Christians believed Pentecostals to chaotic and disorderly. Pentecostal practices of speaking in tongues, their beliefs in divine healing and prophecy, and their unorganized and noisy prayer gatherings ostracized them from other established Protestant traditions believed to be more orderly and respectable. They were seen as a fringe group that stood outside of the traditions of mainline and evangelical branches of the larger Protestant community.  

However, Pentecostalism and a majority of the Christian communities in the United States would undergo a massive shift as Pentecostal theology and practices burst into the “orderly” worlds of mainline denominations and swept across denominational boundaries beginning in 1960.  In a small Episcopalian perish in Van Nuys, CA in April 1960, the charismatic renewal found its genesis when Reverend Dennis Bennett shared his experience of being baptized in the Spirit and speaking in tongues. His announcement angered his congregation and he was asked to resign shortly after sharing his experiences. 

Despite the parishioners of St. Mark’s Episcopal Church being told to not speak about what Reverend Bennett shared about, one parishioner was not going to be quiet. Jean Stone was a parishioner who began a media campaign to chronicle and share about Reverend Bennett’s experience.  Stone got Time Magazine and Newsweek to write articles about the renewal movement and Bennett became the defacto face of the Charismatic Renewal movement in the United States. As Bennett’s story spread throughout the country, other clergy from mainline Protestant denominations began to share about their experiences of being baptized in the Holy Spirit. Methodists, Lutherans, Baptists, Presbyterians, Anglicans, Mennonites, Roman Catholics, and others began to open up about their Pentecostal experience and many began to practice speaking in tongues, prophesying, healing, and deliverance.

Although there is an overlap between some of the beliefs between Pentecostals and Charismatics, there are some key differences. Both groups believe in the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, which is an experience that often takes place after conversion (although some adherents experience the Baptism of the Holy Spirit at their conversion). A key difference is the evidence of being baptized in the Holy Spirit. Pentecostals believe that a person must speak in tongues in order to demonstrate that they have been baptized in the Spirit. Charismatics claim that although many people do speak in tongues as their first sign, it is not the only sign that accompanies being baptized in the Holy Spirit. Any manifestations of the gifts of the Holy Spirit outlined in the New Testament are recognized by Charismatics as being baptized in the Spirit.  

The Charismatic Renewal Movement validated Historical Pentecostal churches and movements as part of the American Christian landscape. Prior to the movement, Mainline and Protestant denominations viewed Pentecostalism with disdain and were weary of their theology and practices. However, the media coverage of Reverend Dennis Bennett’s experiences in California in 1960, as well as the rise in denominational clergy sharing about their own experiences of being baptized in the Holy Spirit, led mainline denominational leaders were to address the Charismatic renewal movements taking place in their churches.  Most of these denominations ultimately accepted Charismatic adherents as part of their tradition. Other denominations left their position on the charismatic renewal movement open without rejecting the movement outright.",1960,2020,1018,762,Nathan Womack,5,Courtney Fitzsimmons,2020-07-24 00:12:00.075 +0200,2020-08-11 00:30:30.510 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.05722106101119321,0.00034797271176552775,5.597313596273358e-12,0.9423786018892849,5.2364382158968576e-05,6.0391814150919745e-33
894,Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches,43,Religious Group (v6),"The UFMCC (often shortened to “MCC”) is a Christian denomination that was founded first and foremost as a ministry for LGBTQ people. Reverend Troy Perry, who grew up in rural Florida and worked as a pastor in Baptist and Pentecostal churches before coming out as gay, launched the initial congregation in his Los Angeles living room in 1968. When the denomination was officially established in 1970, there were a handful of congregations, spanning several states. By 1972, there were 35 congregations in 19 states. Today, the MCC consists of over 200 congregations in over 30 countries around the world (although this entry focuses on the U.S. and Canada).

Perry served as Moderator (the denomination’s head) until 2005, and since then there have been three Moderators. Rev. Elder Cecilia Eggleston was elected Moderator in 2019. Every three years, all MCC ministers and selected members gather for General Conference, where the Moderator and the Governing Board (administrative leadership) are elected.

Individual congregations maintain a great deal of autonomy over their worship practices, and thus there is a wide variety of worship styles in the MCC. Many churches blend charismatic and more formal influences. One of the few denomination-wide requirements for worship is that every congregation offer Holy Communion at weekly services.

The theologically diverse denomination defies easy labels of ""conservative"" and “liberal.” For decades, the denomination’s doctrinal statements proudly proclaimed that the MCC “moved in the mainstream of Christianity,” which they defined by the Apostles’ and Nicene creeds. Additionally, these doctrinal statements made what most would deem to be orthodox Protestant affirmations, such as “All men are justified to God through Faith” and “the Bible is the divinely inspired Word of God.” 

In the twenty-first century, however, the denomination's official proclamations of doctrine have become less insistently “orthodox.” Even as the personal theologies of many MCC ministers and members continue to resemble “orthodox Protestant” beliefs, the denomination’s Statement of Faith now includes proclamations like “We don't all believe exactly the same things” and “We are part of an ongoing conversation on matters of belief and faith, shaped by scripture and the historic creeds” (with no attendant declaration of the scripture’s divine inspiration). 

If there is one unifying theological theme across the MCC, from its inception to the present, it is the belief that support for LGBTQ equality is an outgrowth of authentic Christian faith, which is “grounded in God's radically inclusive love for all people” (as the current Statement of Faith puts it). In recent years, what began as the church’s focus on equality for “homosexuals” has expanded, at least in many of the denomination’s circles, to include a focus on social justice issues more broadly.",1968,2020,1049,785,William Stell,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-24 00:32:51.624 +0200,2020-08-16 22:19:01.702 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.9646281377262985,3.7099782074928075e-14,4.93202901026115e-23,4.0363595350963054e-20,0.03537186227366436,9.321399571665904e-29
896,Sannō Shintō,43,Religious Group (v6),"Sannō shintō refers to narratives, doctrinal analyses and artistic depictions related to the “mountain sovereigns” (jp. Sannō), the deities of the Hie shrine, now Hiyoshi taisha, in Sakamoto at the foothills of Mount Hiei. 
In Sannō shintō, the identity of the Hie deities is chiefly conceptualised with the vocabulary and semiotic framework of Tendai Buddhism, and in special (but not exclusive) relation to the lineages residing at the Enryakuji on Mount Hiei, to this day the main Tendai centre in Japan. While the first extant sources relating the Hie deities to the Enryakuji date back to the ninth century, Sannō shintō reached its apex as a discourse in the middle ages (12th-15th century), throughout which the majority of the material extensively treating the identities of the deities was collected.
More concretely, Sannō shintō can be defined in two ways. In a narrow sense, it only indicates discourses produced at the Enryakuji, mostly mythological and doctrinal, which establish correspondences between the deities of Hie and specific Buddhas and bodhisattvas. Although Sannō is a collective term for the whole host of deities enshrined in the twenty-one shrines of Hie, most often the “mountain sovereigns” are three of them: Ōmiya, presiding over the western compound of the shrines; Ninomiya, presiding over the eastern, and Shōshinji, also a deity of the western compound. In the “strict” definition of Sannō shintō, these are considered as emanations of, or identical to, three Buddhas: Śākyamuni, the main Buddha of the Western pagoda area of the Enryakuji (saitō), Yakushi (sskr. Bhaiṣajyaguru), presiding over the Konpon chudo in the Eastern pagoda area, and Amida (sskr. Amitabha), presiding over the Yokawa area. Such correspondences are sanctioned by monastic treatises such as the Keiranshūyōshū (14th century).
At a broader level, however, we can say that Sannō shintō is also made up of discourses on the deities of Hie that do not quite befit the narrow interpretation. For instance, these might be mythological accounts produced at the Hie shrine, touching upon subjects such as the origin and enshrinement of the deities; accounts of the festival held each year for the deities, as well as monastic discourses which do not quite conceptualise the deities within the same correspondences of the narrow definition. In this entry I shall adopt the broader definition for three reasons. Firstly, because the medieval Hie shrines and Enryakuji were closely intertwined from an institutional point of view. Secondly, because the correspondences of the narrow definition do not represent the full extent of the diachronic evolution of Sannō shintō. Thirdly, because the “narrow” definition of Sannō shintō presupposes the “broader” one, especially from a mythological perspective. Thirdly, because textual material that presents the correspondences of the “narrow” version of Sannō shintō often also includes accounts produced not by monastics, but by priestly lineages at the shrines. Such is the case for two of the the texts which are considered synonymous with Sannō shintō, Yōtenki (13-15th century) and Sange Yōryakki (13th century).
Taking account of this, in consulting this entry one should keep in mind at all times that Sannō shintō was not a conscious religious group, but a discursive field comprising various mythologies, ritual and devotional aspects, all joined together by being centred on the same deities and the same place. 
Please note that this article focuses on the medieval discourse on the Hie deities, but not on Sannō ichijutsu shintō, the pre-modern discourse issued from Sannō shintō but focused on the Tōshōgū, in Nikko.",800,1571,1050,787,Emanuela Sala,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-24 09:53:43.566 +0200,2022-11-08 23:40:20.497 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),1.670028700180108e-14,1.1521403483717272e-26,1.8412864163625444e-79,1.7577506988169707e-57,0.9048393702152042,0.0951606297847791
899,Nahdlatul Ulama (NU),43,Religious Group (v6),"Nahdlatul Ulama is an Islamic mass organization in Indonesia. The organization was founded in 1926 by Hasyim Asyari in Surabaya, East Java, in response to the increasing presence of modernist Islam in the Dutch East Indies and the institutional force of Muhammadiyah, a modernist Islamic mass organization. The stated goal of the organization was to defend the interests and values of the scholars of traditionalist Sunni Islam, Ash'ari theology, and the Shafi'i school of jurisprudence. 

Although the organization has a central leadership, there are many additional centers of authority underneath this top level, including provincial and regional branches and autonomous affiliated organizations for certain groups (e.g. women, youth, students). The beating heart of the organization is the network of traditionalist Islamic schools called (pesantren), where the future leaders and scholars of the organization are educated. Through the extensive pesantren network, the organization is able to reach and recruit constituents in a widely dispersed geographic area. The kyai or leaders of these pesantren are furthermore authoritative figures in their respective communities that exceeds the education of youth. 

The organization has undergone multiple shifts in its almost century-long history. During the last years of Dutch colonial rule and the Japanese occupation (1942-45), Nahdlatul Ulama became politically active. After independence, Nahdlatul Ulama and the modernist Islamic mass organization Muhammadiyah worked together in a political party, Masyumi, representing the interests of Indonesian Muslims; but due to internal conflicts, Nahdlatul Ulama withdrew from Masyumi in 1952 and founded their own political party. The organization remained active in party politics until 1984. Since this time, it has not been directly involved in party politics. 

Since the fall of the New Order in 1998, Nahdlatul Ulama has taken an active role in the formation in what they consider a tolerant, civil, and moderate Islam. In 1999, the renowned former chairman of Nahdlatul Ulama, Abdurrahman Wahid (more commonly known as Gus Dur) became the first democratically elected president of Reformation Era Indonesia. While his tenure as president was only two years long, his vision for the organization and the relation between the country and Islam continues to shape the organization until today. Gus Dur is held up as a hallmark of a friendly, accommodating, and tolerant Islam. Since 2015, this vision of a moderate Islam has become known within Nahdlatul Ulama as ‘Islam Nusantara,’ the Islam of the Indonesian world, a term which points to the organization’s commitment to embracing local culture, to coexisting peacefully with others, and to being an bulwark against radical Islamic influence.",1926,2020,1053,735,Verena Meyer,37,William Noseworthy,2020-07-26 22:02:17.972 +0200,2020-07-27 22:40:45.838 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.3098085195951341,0.0022409414121637833,2.261716681728595e-22,1.5756329260773396e-11,0.6879505389769457,1.2860920387375002e-27

Note: The gradual Christianization of Britain in this period was not a homogeneous or coherent process. The British Church appears to have a well-integrated provincial hierarchy in the fourth century: our earliest documentary evidence is the presence of British bishops at the Council of Arles in 314 CE. Yet its continuation is shadowy until the sixth century. Christianity retained a stronger foothold in the Western and some northern parts, while it may have declined in the East under pressure of Germanic raids and settlements by the end of the period. Just across the northern border however the Picts also appear to adopted (and abandoned) Christianity, while St Patrick brought it across the water to Ireland.

906,The Church of England,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Church of England is the established church of the nation of England and has its origin in Henry VIII's break from Rome in 1534. The so-called 'Elizabethan Settlement' was an attempt by Queen Elizabeth I to find a via media between the radical Protestantism of the Puritan movement and the excesses of Roman Catholicism. As such, under Queen Elizabeth, the Church of England established its identity as Reformed and Catholic: 'Reformed' in the sense that it identified its theological authority not primarily in the traditions of the Church but in Scripture, and 'Catholic' in the sense that it retained such Catholic traits as an emphasis upon the apostolic succession of bishops, the sacramental identity of the Church, a formal liturgical character, and the Church's continuity with the Medieval and Patristic past.
In the modern period (here demarcated as beginning in 1963 with the publication of the significant work of liberal theology 'Honest to God', by the then Bishop of Woolwich John Robinson), the Church of England's identity and sources of authority are contested. Although its sources of doctrine and practice are still formally codified in Canon Law as deriving from Scripture and its historical formularies - the Book of Common Prayer, the 1662 Ordinal, and the Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion - there is wide divergence of opinion as to how this is to be understood.
The current 'parties' in the Church of England can be divided into three: Evangelical, Catholic and Liberal. Evangelicals emphasize the Reformed heritage of the Church of England and note the authority of Scripture. Catholics stress the importance of the Church's sacraments, its links to the Medieval and Patristic past, and its relationship with other episcopally led churches such as the Roman Catholic Church. Liberals highlight the role of reason in the interpretation of Scripture and the historic formularies. The existence of these different 'traditions' within the Church of England results in a sense of its contested identity: doctrine, belief and practice often vary dramatically from church to church. Its unifying feature must be said therefore to be the institutional structure focussed on the ecclesiastical hierarchy - archbishops, bishops, priests etc. - and the centralized and diocesan adminstrations which oversee parishes and other institutions within the Church.",1963,2020,725,793,Jamie Franklin,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-28 11:33:10.109 +0200,2020-08-05 17:05:20.676 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.10289570404474999,0.0027358469064437934,0.7991461272260284,0.09521348226147294,8.839561304797324e-06,2.7515748570704356e-34
908,Sino-Christian Theology,43,Religious Group (v6),"“Sino-Christian Theology” designates an academic, cultural, and theological movement that began in mainland China during the 1980’s, and that later developed in other Sinophone areas like Hong Kong and (to a lesser extent) Taiwan. Distinct from the official Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association (CPCA), Three-Self Patriotic Movement (TSPM), and the substantial evangelical, charismatic, and Neo-Calvinist movements, it represents a small, possibly waning, but altogether unique expression of Christianity in postsocialist China.  ¶  The term “Sino-Christian Theology” translates hanyu jidu shenxue, which literally means “Han-language Christian theology.” Most commonly, it refers to an intellectual wave inaugurated by the work of Liu Xiaofeng and He Guanghu, both professors at Renmin University who have since become quasi-canonized as its “church fathers.” While the movement has diversified over its decades-long development, three broad features remain. Sino-Christian Theology: is written in Chinese; emphasizes the contemporary situation; and prioritizes universities (rather than churches or seminaries) as the primary site for knowledge production.  ¶  Conventionally, Sino-Christian Theologians tend to be “Cultural Christians” (wenhua jidutu), i.e. Christians who do not profess “personal faith” in Christianity or who are not regular, church-going attendees. As far as the Chinese public and even most scholars are concerned, Sino-Christian Theology and Chinese Cultural Christianity are virtually synonymous. “China’s Apollos,” “China’s Nicodemus,” and “Scholars in Mainland China Studying Christianity” (SMSC) are other appellations that have been used to describe the movement.  ¶  Sino-Christian Theologians have tended to approach theology from within the disciplines of literature, philosophy, and various social sciences. Yang Huilin sees the movement as closer to Religious Studies than Theology (as conceived in the West), while Chloe Starr observes that Sino-Christian Theology constitutes a “theorizing of theology itself.”  ¶  There are three primary contexts in which Sino-Christian Theology has arisen. The first, as Fredrik Fallman observes, concerns the broader Chinese quest for modernity. Since China’s humiliating defeats by foreign imperialists during the so-called “Century of Humiliation”, Chinese intellectuals have labored to reform China and re-negotiate its place in the new global world order. Not unlike Republican-era Christians like Wu Leichuan and Zhao Zichen, Sino-Christian Theologians turn to Christian resources to address China’s ongoing aspirations to modernize. The second, following Starr, locates the movement within larger globalizing trends of the world-wide church. Alongside Black American, Korean Minjung, and various postcolonial theologies, Sino-Christian Theology represents the continuing Chinese attempt to forge a Christianity that does dialogical, liberational justice to contextual sociocultural realities. The post-Mao Reform Era constitutes the third context. The movement arose due to the relaxation of restrictions in virtually all spheres of life, whether economic, political, or religious. But despite this relative “opening up,” certain fundamental strictures of the state remain, whether in its official socialist-atheistic ideology or overarching materialist-economic aspirations. Nonetheless, it is precisely within these conditions – which have precipitated the much-discussed “values vacuum” of contemporary China – that Sino-Christian Theology performs its most creative and constructive work.",1980,2020,1119,794,Teng-Kuan Ng,45,Matthew Hamm,2020-07-28 19:42:07.867 +0200,2021-09-29 20:34:35.309 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.5853678285253411,0.006250072759439399,1.998912140819671e-11,0.4079086137666365,0.0004734849285938703,5.833219645167107e-21
910,Christian Base Community movement,43,Religious Group (v6),"Christian Base Communities (in Spanish: Comunidades Eclesiales de Base or CEBs) spread across Latin America in the years following the CELAM Bishop's conference in Medellín, Colombia in 1968. Associated with the emergence of Latin American liberation theology, CEBs of the late 1960s began as community formation projects led by missionary nuns and priests in poor communities. Their model and method took inspiration from Paulo Freire’s Pedagogy of the Oppressed (1968), the Second Vatical Council (1962 – 1965), from early Catholic Action programs, and from the social and political critiques that emerged among liberation movements across the region following the Cuban Revolution. Throughout the 1970s, CEBs became increasingly lay-led and developed into a powerful religious and political social movement. As such, while CEBs often formed larger regional or national organizations to facilitate communication and political mobilization, this movement was broadly grassroots, disaggregated, and pluralistic in theology, practice, and sense of purpose. Despite their significant diversity, Latin American CEBs shared common tendencies such as: lay leadership and greater lay participation in liturgical life, small community worship and organization, an emphasis on gender parity, a commitment to grassroots politics, a Marxist and liberation theology-informed social critique, and a spiritual educational model rooted in lay analysis of scripture applied to present, worldly concerns.

914,Tariqa Shadhiliyya,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Tariqa Shadhiliyya is a Sufi order dating back to the 13th Century CE.  It takes its name from Abu al-Hasan al-Shadhili who was born in the Ghumara region of Morocco (1196) and died in Humaythara, Egypt (1258).  Originating in the milieu of the western Islamic world (Andalusia and al-Maghrib), the Shadhiliyya spread through North Africa (via Tunisia) and established a firm foundation in the Middle East as one of the prominent Sufi orders of the medieval and modern Muslim world.  Influences on the al-Shadhili included figures in this western Islamic world such as Abu Madyan (d. 1198), Abd al-Salam b. Mashish (d. 1227), and Ibn Arabi (d. 1240).  It also emerged in the political context of the Almohad revolt against the Almoravids, and therefore the emphasis of the former on the absolute unity of Allah (the principle of tawhid) became a component of al-Shadhili’s teachings, although it was filtered through Ibn Arabi’s conceptions of wahdat al-wujud (unity of existence).  While influenced by his contemporaries, al-Shadhili saw himself not as merely an inheritor but as the creator of a distinctive path (tariqa).  In the case of al-Shadhili, this path was passed on through specific prayers and formulaic sayings whose repetition is integral to the spiritual development of the disciple (e.g., hizb, dhikr, wird, du’a).  Although these core practices remain present, the attitude of continued reform embodied in al-Shadhili’s teaching and reflected in the common saying ‘A Sufi is a child of one’s time’ (al-sufi ibn waqtihi) allowed certain figures cast themselves (or are cast by others) as ‘renewers’ or ‘reformers,’ and these reform movements continue to give rise to new branches.

In line with many Sufi orders, the Shadhiliyya serves as a trunk out of which many branches emerge, so it is common to see references to the Shadhiliyya in hyphenated form.  For example, a full lineage of a northern Moroccan branch founded in 2007 would read Fawziyya-Alawiyya-Karkariyya-Darqawiyya-Shadhiliyya while another Egyptian branch is Jazuliyya-Husayniyya-Shadhiliyya.  The Shadhiliyya also has several branches of 'Western Sufism' (or led by western converts to Islam) such as the Murabitun (led by Ian Dallas aka Shaykh Abd al-Qadir al-Sufi), the Maryamiyya (founded by Fritjof Schuon), and Nuh Ha Mim Keller's Shadhili group in Jordan.  This interaction is not new, however, since its Andalusian spread potentially influenced a few Christian mystics like St. John of the Cross and Teresa of Avila.

What unites these distinct branches is that they trace their ‘tariqa’ (literally path or way) back to al-Shadhili through a spiritual lineage (silsila).  The term ‘tariqa’ has most often been translated as ‘order,’ often drawing on an analogy between Sufi and monastic orders.  However, rather than referring simply to the social group, tariqa refers to the way of life that leads one to live a pious life and potentially encounter the divine.  This ‘way of life’ consists of an ensemble of exercises performed under the supervision and with the guidance of a master shaykh.  For example, the recitation of prayers (ahzab) attributed to the founder or the performance of poetry from a collective corpus of poems (diwan) from famous Shadhili shaykhs are a major part of what defines a group as Shadhili.  

In the case of the Shadhiliyya, some of the prominent figures include:

-	Abu al-Abbas al-Mursi (d. 1271): Considered al-Shadhili’s successor, al-Mursi was an Andalusian Sufi now considered to be one of the main saints of Egypt.  

-	Al-Busiri (d. 1294): This Moroccan author of the famous poem ‘The Mantle’ (al-Burda) was originally from southern Morocco and studied under al-Mursi in the Shadhili order.

-	Abu al-Qasim al-Himyari: Known as Ibn al-Sabbagh, he was the author of ‘The Pearl of Mysteries and the Gem of Purity’ (Durrat al-Asrar wa tuhfat al-abrar) that contains valuable biographical information about al-Shadhili that details his time in Morocco, Tunisia, and Egypt, serving as a primary source for subsequent biographical dictionaries (tabaqat).

-	Ibn Ata Allah al-Iskandiri (d. 1309): Credited with consolidating and spreading al-Shadhili’s teachings, this Egyptian leader of the Shadhiliyya is widely known for his book of aphorisms ‘al-Hikam’ (The Wisdom) and his autobiographical ‘Lata’if al-minan’ (Subtle Blessings) written in 1298.  This latter work articulates a conception of sainthood connected to an inheritance from and emulation of the Prophet Muhammad.

-	Ibn Abbad al-Rundi (d. 1390): Born in Ronda, Spain, he is known for his commentary on Ibn Ata Allah’s aphorisms and for potential influences on Christian mystics in the region.  He is buried in the Bab Ftuh cemetery in Fes, Morocco.

-	Ali b. Muhammad Wafa (d. 1405): This Egyptian Sufi of Mamluk lineage created the Wafa’iyya-Shadhiliyya branch with his father Muhammad, blending a spiritual heritage from al-Shadhili with a local familial authority that allowed the father to compose unique litanies (ahzab) that were spread by his son Ali.  In addition to blending different modalities of sanctity, the Wafa’iyya branch reflects an earlier attempt to integrate the thinking of Ibn Arabi and the Shadhiliyya.

-	Muhammad al-Jazuli (d. 1465): One of the seven saints of Marrakech, this famous Moroccan Sufi wrote a compilation of prayers on the Prophet Muhammad known in short as ‘The Waymarks of Benefits’ (Dala’il al-Khayrat).  His renown also made him a significant political figure and as he gained a following, he was expelled and eventually poisoned by a rival politician in 1465.  The Jazuliyya-Shadhiliyya became one of the most prominent and influential branches during the medieval period.

-	Ahmad Zarruq (d. 1493): Labeled as a ‘conservative rebel’ by scholar of Islam Scott Kugle, Zarruq challenged al-Jazuli and his followers for their acceptance of sainthood grounded in popular politics and miraculous deeds.  In contrast, Zarruq presented himself as a ‘juridical saint,’ deriving his sanctity from his knowledge and practice of Islamic jurisprudence and performing that sanctity through the moral criticism of his surrounding society.  As such, he rebelled against what he saw as moral corruption (due in large part to divergent and exploitative saints) by articulating a conservative, reformed Sufism that placed a greater emphasis on jurisprudence.  He is an important early modern reformist thinker that would serve as a predecessor to later Sufi reform movements.

-	Muhammad b. Isa (d. 1526): Founder of the Aissawa (Isawa) order known for its music, trance dances, and intricate rhythmic structures, he was a member of the Jazuliyya-Shadhiliyya that built his own lodge (zawiya) in Meknes, Morocco.  In Morocco today, they are often hired as musicians for different events, making them both a Sufi order and something like a professional musicians’ guild.

-	Abd al-Rahman al-Majdhub (d. 1568): This famous Moroccan poet is known by his nickname ‘al-Majdhub.’  Literally meaning mad or crazy, majdhub refers to a divinely inspired madness that prevents individuals from functioning properly in ordinary life but allows them to provide insight and blessings or perform miraculous deeds.  Many of his poems are so widespread that they are transmitted not as poems but as proverbs in Morocco.  He was a student in the lineage of Ahmad Zarruq and is said to have founded a Majdhubi-Zarruqi-Shadhili branch that presented a rival vision of sainthood to the popular Jazuli-Shadhili order of the time.

-	Ahmad ibn Ajiba (d. 1809): As an initiate in the Darqawi-Shadhili branch, he was a prolific write widely known for his interpretation (tafsir) of the Quran ‘The Immense Sea’ (Al-Bahr al-Madid).  

-	Muhammad al-Arabi al-Darqawi (d. 1823): This Moroccan Sufi was a spiritual, political, and military leader.  On the political and military side, he participated in revolts against foreign influences (Ottoman, Spanish, French) and against domestic leaders (Mawlay Sulayman) in the 19th century.  At the same time, many Moroccan elites and members of the Alawi royal family were members of the Darqawiyya.  In the 20th century under the French Protectorate, political expediencies resulted in a mix of confrontation and collaboration with French and Spanish authorities.  As a spiritual leader, al-Darqawi is best known through his letters and is recognized as a ‘renewer’ that gave rise to multiple branches.

-	Ahmad b. Idris (d. 1837): Of Moroccan origin, although he did not formally establish his own order, this prolific figure had a tremendous influence on several modern Sufi reform movements (often glossed as neo-Sufi orders).  Three of these influences include (1) Muhammad b. Ali al-Sanusi (d. 1859) – founder of the Sanusiyya order that resisted French colonialism in Libya –(2) Muhammad Uthman al-Mirghani (d. 1852) – founder of the Khatmiyya/Mirghaniyya in Sudan that would later become central to Sudanese politics – and (3) Abd al-Rahman al-Duwayhi al-Rashid (d. 1874) – founder of the Ahmadiyya-Rashidiyya branch that would spread through East Africa, the Middle East, northern India, and southeast Asia.  His teachings included an emphasis on Islamic jurisprudence and the renewal of independent legal reasoning (ijtihad) as a way to overcome the stagnation of legal thinking and blind adherence (taqlid), as well as a spiritual doctrine of the Muhammadan Way (tariqa Muhammadiyya) that sought both the emulation of the Prophetic model (sunna) and encounter with the Prophet Muhammad in a conscious state. 

-	Abd al-Rahman al-Fasi (d. 1878): Initiated in the Darqawi-Shadhili branch, al-Fasi founded the Fasiyya branch in 1850 originally in Libya and later in Mecca with lodges in Yemen, Syria, and Egypt as well.  His most famous disciple was Abd al-Qadir al-Jizairi (d. 1883) who led a resistance movement against the French in Algeria and was eventually exiled to Damascus where he established a circle of followers under the spiritual patronage of al-Fasi.  This circle would be an important element in the development of modern Salafi thought.

-	Ahmad al-Alawi (d. 1933): Born in Mostaghanem, Algeria, Shaykh Ahmad al-Alawi (born Ahmad b. Aliywa) founded the Alawi branch of the Darqawi-Shadhili in 1914.  While working in a variety of modern fields to encourage the integration of European and Islamic ideas Shaykh Alawi had a significant influence on several European thinkers (e.g., Guenon).  He is considered a ‘renewer’ of the Shadhili for his redeployment of the spiritual retreat (khalwa) with a specific articulation (talqin) of the name Allah as a primary practice for disciples.  Currently, the Alawiyya is headed by Shaykh Khalid b. Tunis and has membership throughout Europe and North Africa.",1258,2020,1064,800,John Thibdeau,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-29 19:49:11.594 +0200,2020-08-14 20:37:22.557 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.9228896365742355,1.3266497648983193e-13,5.40197485536732e-23,1.2837313847069747e-21,0.0771103634256319,9.701058902486376e-28
915,Protestantism welcoming People with Disabilities,43,Religious Group (v6),"This group is unified by commitment to the inclusion of people with disabilities, rather than by geographical or other doctrinal unanimity. However, this commitment generates similar theological reflection and a shared range of social practices. Disagreement about the nature of inclusion persists; this group is distinguished by consistent participation in a conversation about disability inclusion. This entry will highlight how that conversation impacts these organizations' ritual, theology, and other social practices.

Most of this information is based on unpublished ethnographic research conducted by a team led by the Rev. Dr. Erin Raffety of the Center for Theological Inquiry from May - December of 2019, of which I was a part. Our team of 6 researchers worked with 10 organizations in the NJ-NY-PA area who were intentionally welcoming people with disabilities, with the goal of seeing what worked well and what could be done better. We received IRB approval before starting research from New England IRB. All participants signed consent forms showing their awareness of the research. Notes that lack explicit citation are based on this fieldwork, which will be published under the title, From Inclusion to Leadership: Congregational Ministry with People with Disabilities by Eerdmans Publishing in 2021. 

Through fieldwork, it became clear to me and the rest of our research team that one central question for these organizations concerns integrated vs segregated ministry. Ought churches start new programs to specifically welcome people with various disabilities? Or ought they reform their current programs and services such that people with disabilities can access them more effectively? 

Another prominent theme was reflection on the role of the Church in promoting the life and rights of people with disabilities. What ought churches provide and how can churches best support other non-profit organizations and schools that are already welcoming and supporting people with various kinds of disabilities? 

A final theme was the importance of empowering people with disabilities in addition to merely welcoming them. Many churches were eager to discuss different forms this could take, especially with regard to intellectual disability. Some were more reluctant but still open. What does it mean for people with intellectual disabilities in particular to be not just objects of ministry, but subjects? How might churches refine their conceptions of ministry and discipleship in light of this?

In this entry, I use the terms “people with disabilities” and “disabled people” interchangeably to represent some of the range of ways people with disabilities identify, some preferring person-first language and others not. Our research included people with a variety of physical disabilities (eg. blindness, mobility impairments), intellectual disabilities (Autism Spectrum Disorder, Down’s Syndrome), chronic illness (Crohn's, diabetes), and mental health challenges (depression, Bipolar Disorder).",2000,2020,1065,802,Kevin Vollrath,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-29 21:57:54.030 +0200,2020-08-15 23:25:33.415 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),6.761040221485037e-13,2.0940756374243544e-15,6.669248745806558e-33,0.9990452586475286,0.0009547413517932505,1.7162582358054842e-32
918,Fangshi,43,Religious Group (v6),"Fangshi (方士) has been variously translated as technicians, masters of methods, recipes or esoterica, even necromancers. Historical records show that they were active through the period of the late Warring States to the Han. It is unlikely, however, that they had a collective identity as such, as scholar Nathan Sivin notes, “fangshi is not a social category but an epithet.” 
No writings by these men which would represent their voice directly have been left. Instead the Shiji 史記 (Records of the Historian), written by Sima Qian司馬遷 (c.145-c.86 BC) offers the most famous and earliest accounts of the fangshi. Overall described in a negative light, the historian tells us that they were hired to procure drugs of immortality—the first emperor of the Qin (r.247-210 BC) had a great desire to become a transcendent— and promised a way to ascend to Heaven through sacrificial offerings—the emperor Wu of the Han (r.140-87 BC) seems to have preferred this. 
Their origin is obscure. According to the Shiji, they were mostly from the coastal areas of the Qi and Yan states. Evidence of their presence came to light in the invitation of the first emperor of the Qin upon the latter’s imperial tours after the unification. Since then, they rose to prominence at the court of the Han. However, historians and thinkers, especially of the Eastern Han (25-220 CE) were increasingly critical of these men saying that they were just selling empty words. Despite this disapproval, they became widely popular and some were revered as cult figures. From the 2nd century CE, many fangshi were entered in hagiographies of transcendents (xian 仙). 
For this reason, it seems almost impossible to draw a clear boundary between historical and fictional accounts of these men. This makes it difficult to evaluate their historical importance to religious developments in China. Several questions remain to be answered: how much did their activities overlap with other technical specialists like physicians, astrologers and diviners? Did the yangsheng 養生 (nurturing life) practices—diet, drugs ingestion, gymnastics and breathing cultivation etc.—widely circulated during the Han originate from the methods of the fangshi? What is the relationship between this group and the transcendents found in early accounts like the Zhuangzi 莊子? Though often condemned or mysticized, it might be fairer to say that they occupied an intermediate position between those who strived for transcendence by cultivating their body and those in positions of power who sought immortality by occult recipes. Most significantly, they played a crucial role in shaping Daoist religious traditions of later periods as their methods and lineages were largely incorporated in the techniques and teachings of the Dao (daoshu 道術/daojiao 道敎).",-475,220,10,761,Lana Ko,45,Matthew Hamm,2020-07-30 13:40:21.434 +0200,2021-09-29 20:33:29.103 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.0114092653077252,2.7298359989566826e-12,7.720448874158065e-14,1.1944732507867534e-13,0.27110383156252005,0.7174869031268283
919,Catholicism in contemporary Croatia,43,Religious Group (v6),"This database entry pertains to Roman Catholicism in contemporary Croatia. The geographical area covered corresponds to today's boundaries of the Republic of Croatia and the time period is delimited from 1995 to present-day (2020). Catholics represent the majority of the population in contemporary Croatia and have a very significant influence in the culture and politics of the country. It is widely accepted among scholars of the region that Catholicism is tightly bound together with Croatian ethnicity and national identity.

Undoubtedly, there are continuities between the religious group defined in this entry and other Catholic groups, in particular those in contemporary South and Southeastern Europe. Among these groups, Catholic Croats living in Bosnia and Herzegovina (especially in the region of Herzegovina) and some regions of Serbia (e.g. Vojvodina) stand out. These populations largely identify as part of a single ethnic group that shares history and traditions (religious and otherwise) with most of the population of Croatia. Nevertheless, Catholic Croats residing in neighboring countries or those living further afield, sometimes referred to as Croatian diaspora, are not included in this entry. The reason for this is that there are important differences in regard to their relationship to the state, the political status of their religious group and identity, and their interaction with other religious groups within the polity in which they live.

Regarding the similarity between Catholicism in Croatia and elsewhere, there is also a significant degree of coincidence. The Catholic Church in Croatia is in full communion with the Vatican, which means that all dogma, doctrine and cannon law are essentially the same as in the rest of the world. However, particular histories and socio-cultural contexts produce unique features in tradition, practice and even belief in every context, and Croatia is no exception. In this database entry, specific elements and idiosyncrasies that distinguish Croatian Catholicism, such as the importance of pilgrimages, are elaborated in the qualitative notes of the relevant questions.

Just like in the geographical dimension, in the temporal one there is significant continuity between Croatian Catholicism as described in this entry and that of preceding historical periods (e.g. S. XX). This continuity is particularly clear in the domains of religious belief and practice. However, that is not the case in the political, sociological and cultural domains. In this entry, 'contemporary' has been defined as the period from 1995 onward. This year marks the beginning of a peaceful, democratic period in the history of Croatia, existing as an independent nation, that lasts until the present. The period comes immediately after a violent war (1991-1994) where the Republic of Croatia fought against the central  government in Belgrade to gain independence from the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. This war is part of what is commonly referred to as the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s, which led to the eventual disintegration of the SFR of Yugoslavia. The history of this series of armed conflicts is very complex and is outside of the scope of this database. However, it is important to know that the main factions involved are generally defined along ethno-religious lines and that the conflicts were plagued with atrocities committed along these same lines. Therefore, 1995 represents the beginning of the peacetime political order that still prevails in Croatia; an order which is different from the preceding one in regard to, among other things, the status of, and relationships between, different religious groups within the country.

Finally, it is important to note that, in a database entry such as this one, it is impossible to make justice to the richness and diversity of experience, practice, belief and tradition of any religious group and, especially, one with millions of members and a theological tradition of two millennia. The yes/no answers in this entry aim to reflect the most general response to the questions. However, there are cases where such general answers are not possible. This could be because there is no doctrine regarding a specific issue and no general consensus among members of the group, because there is are differences between the doctrine of the Church and widespread beliefs or practices, or simply because the issues are contested even among religious specialists. In general, when there is no obvious consensus answer to a question, this entry favours Church doctrine and teachings, in particular as defined by the Catechism of the Catholic Church. When this is not possible, or when the practices or beliefs of Catholics in Croatia differ overwhelmingly from doctrine, then the popular view is favoured. In these cases, explanations, caveats and further clarifications are included in the qualitative notes.",1995,2020,1068,801,Miguel Alcalde,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-30 20:39:37.226 +0200,2020-08-14 19:57:09.527 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),6.309771073918482e-12,2.4397447781093334e-14,4.434694164748648e-43,0.975197923100314,0.02480207689335182,5.002644481679108e-20
921,Bhils,43,Religious Group (v6),"Bhils are a part of a geospatially dispersed tribal community of Western India. They are grouped under the constitutional category of Scheduled Tribes. While Bhili is the main language for the community, Bhils are known to be conversant with a variety of other vernacular languages depending on the region they reside in. Bhils have a rich tradition of orally transmitted religious literature which shares similarities with classical Hindu mythology and yet it is distinct in its own vernacular way. Bhils pay reverence to most popular Hindu gods, rituals, and customs; however, most of the gods and associated practices have hybrid histories with classical myths and practices fluidly blending in with vernacular variants.  


The term Bhil is thought to be derived from the word, Vill, which means bow in Telugu and Kannada. This is keeping in line with their reputation as skilled archers and hunters.  Historically, powerful Bhil kings are thought to have established their own kingdoms in what is present day Gujarat and Rajasthan. It was only through displacement by Rajput and Chalukya rulers of that time that Bhils were made to retreat into forests and hilly regions. Bhils are mentioned in historical records such as Ain-i-Akbari and ancient folk legends such as Kathasaritasagar. Mention of Bhils becomes clearer in the medieval period where their association with Marathas in their fight against the Mughals is well documented. Their knowledge of hilly and jungle terrains made them valuable allies for political powers hoping to control these regions. While some Bhil chiefs decided to assist local political powers, other clan chiefs would resort to resisting these powers often resulting in violent plunders of settled populations. With the influx of British colonialism, the anthropological urge to identify Bhils with primitivity and a prehistorical core of ancient India crystallized Bhil identity as that of Indian aborigines and native inhabitants of India. The British with their military might were more efficient in suppressing raids and plunders by Bhil chiefs. Through diplomatic ties and political manoeuvring, the British were also able to enlist peace treaties with the Bhils and also form Bhil Corps, an integral arm of the colonial law enforcement setup. 


Certain Indological scholarship and popular belief maintains that Bhils are the descendants of Niṣāda tribes mentioned in the Hindu epics, Ramayana and Mahabharata. This association can be mainly traced to descriptions of Niṣādarashtra (the Kingdom of Niṣādas) as lying between Vindhya and Satpura mountains – the present-day heartland of Bhils. Due to this connection, several characters in the epics such as Eklavya in the Mahabharata and Sabari in Ramayana are thought to be Bhils. A similar historical and communal consciousness, along with issues of socioeconomic marginalization and lack of state assistance for rural development, has led to the development of indigenous political movements. One such movement aims to generate support for the creation of a separate state ""Bhil Pradesh"" to be carved out from specific districts of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, and Madhya Pradesh.",1700,2020,1070,775,Maharshi Vyas,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-30 22:24:11.149 +0200,2020-08-22 21:04:50.896 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),4.631602526960257e-13,0.0005294420212389634,1.76476054674873e-66,1.240740930476276e-23,0.9994705579782096,8.824335656779556e-14

925,Rabbinic Judaism (Babylonia),43,Religious Group (v6),"The Babylonian Jewish community dates back to the 6th century BCE, with the exile following the destruction of the first temple. Rabbinic Judaism emerges in Roman Palestine following the destruction of the second temple, producing legal and exegetical texts (the Mishna, Tosefta, and Halakhic Midrashim) during the Tannaitic Era. With the close of the Tannaitic era c.220 CE, the Amoraic sages Rav and Shmuel moved to Babylonia and began to teach Rabbinic traditions to the community there.


During the Amoraic Era (c. 220-500 CE), and the subsequent Saboraic and Gaonic eras, rabbinic teachings were collected and edited into the Babylonian Talmud, a corpus nearly 2 million words long. These traditions encompass a range of genre including biblical interpretation, legal discussions, theology, angels and demons, humor, and history. 

Jews primarily lived along the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. This region was home to a diverse population including Christians, Manichaeans, and Zoroastrians (the official Persian religion).

As a community with roots dating back centuries, Jews in the Sassanian Empire were tolerated and permitted to practice. An official position of ""Exilarch"" was recognized by the Empire. Literary accounts in the Talmud and Gaonic sources speak of persecutions against Jews by the empire in the latter part of this period, although scholars debate their historicity.

The map covers the region of the major Jewish settlements within Babylonia, not the entirety of the Babylonian empire.

926,Ladakhi Buddhism,43,Religious Group (v6),"Ladakhi Buddhism is an inflection of the region’s inclusion in many political entities, in particular, Tibet in the 7th or 8th centuries. An independent kingdom from the tenth century until 1834, Tibetan Buddhism remains the strongest religious influence, especially in the present-day district of Leh. From the 13th century onwards, Ladakhi kings upheld legitimacy through their roles as protectors of the Buddhist dharma, at one point annexing part of western Tibet; but, territorial acquisition was not sustainable. Political contact with Muslim neighbors increased from the 14th century onward through the 17th century when Mughal emperors asserted power over neighboring Kashmir. Following the Ladakh-Tibet-Mughal War 1679-1684, Ladhaki kings’ sustained religious allegiance to Tibetan Buddhism; meanwhile, Muslim populations increase coincided with the matrimonial union between the 17th century Buddhist king, ‘Jam-dbyang-rnam-rgyal, and the Muslim ruler of Baltistan’s daughter, RGyal Khatun. Following failed Portuguese Jesuit missionary efforts, British encounters increased only after 1834 when the armies of Zorawar Singh invaded. By 1842, Ladakh lost its independence to Dogra rule. Four years later, it fell under the state of Jammu-Kashmir which acknowledged the authority of British-India. Royal patronage of the monasteries subsided, but monasteries received some support from the state of Jammu-Kashmir and through sustained connections with Tibet. Indian independence in 1947 was met with the complicated uncertainty of the simultaneous partition of India and Pakistan. Following the imposition of a ceasefire line in 1949, Ladakh and Baltistan were cut off, but further wars between India and Pakistan in 1965 and 1972 continued over Jammu-Kashmir territorial disputes. As of October 31, 2019, Ladakh and Jammu-Kashmir became separate Union Territories where Ladakh remains under direct rule of New Delhi, India.

927,Zealots,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Zealots were a Jewish sect of the first-century CE that appeared after the Roman occupation of Palestine. They are often characterized by their active resistance to Roman rule. Our primary resource for data concerning the Zealots comes from the Jewish historian, Josephus (War 2.4; 2.13; 2.22; 4.3; Ant. 14.9; 14.15; 16.9; 20.9), who offers a biased presentation of certain radical sectarian movements during the First Jewish Revolt (66-73 CE). For this reason, historical descriptions of the Zealots within Josephus are to be evaluated with caution. Josephus makes reference to a ""fourth philosophy"" that he speaks of with great disdain. In addition to the Pharisees, Sadducees, and Essenes, this philosophy is founded by Judas the Galilean or ""of Gaulanitis"" (see also Acts 5:37) and a certain Pharisee named Saddok. This philosophy attracted a great many people, some of whom were young and ""zealous"" (Ant. 18.1). Other characteristics that Josephus ascribes to Judas' movement include a close affiliation with the philosophy of the Pharisees, an interest in freedom, and a belief that only God should be their ruler. 

Elsewhere, early Christian literature refers to a disciple of Jesus with the titular Simon ""the Zealot"" (Luke 6:15; Acts 1:13); however, it is unclear if this terms refers to a religious group, a character trait of Simon (e.g., one who possesses zeal), or a geographical references (Matt 10:4; Mark 3:18). 

The Sicarii are traditionally understood as a more radical and violent subset of the Zealots led by the descendent of Judas, Eleazar (Josephus calls them a ""another sort of robbers"" in War 2.13); however, our sources are not always clear and some have advocated that the two groups be viewed as distinct from each other. The Greek term sikarios is a Latin loan word, meaning assassin, originating in Josephus (War 7.8-11; Ant. 20.9) with a lone reference in the book of Acts (21:38). It appears that the term derives from their weapon of choice, short daggers (see scimitar or sica). According to Josephus, the Sicarii assassinate Jonathan the High Priest and continue on from there to preform ""many"" other ""daily"" murders. The Sicarii are traditionally associated with Masada because of our account in Josephus: they are described as holding the fortress at Masada against the Romans (7.8.2), eventually committing mass suicide at the behest of Eleazar ben Yair; an event that some have described as Josephus' own literary invention. A wealth of archaeological discoveries have been made at Masada, which has lead some to corroborate Josephus' stories with material data (Yadin, Masada [1966]); however, such literal connections have been rightly questioned (see Jodi Magness, Masada: From Jewish Revolt to Modern Myth [2019]).

One of the challenges in differentiating these groups is the range of terms used in our sources including ""robbers"" (Greek: lēstai), ""sicarii""  (Latin: sicarius), ""Galileans"" (see Acts 5:37; Epictetus, Diss. 4.7.6), the ""Barjone"" in rabbinic texts, and the Zealots. Especially outside of Josephus in later rabbinic writings (e.g., Maksh 1.6), these terms appear to take on different meanings. For example, the term Zealot itself has come under scrutiny because the etymology of the semitic term ""zeal"" (qn') possesses a range of meaning outside of Josephus, including one who is zealous for God. With that said, some scholars insist that distinctions are necessary and important, especially considering the more violent descriptions of the Sicarii. Richard Horsley has characterized the Zealots as a group of ""non-violent, if active, resistance"" in stark contrast to the Sicarii (Bandits, Prophets, and Messiahs, 199). In one passage, Josephus appears to make a clear distinction between the Sicarii and Zealots (esp. War 7.8). Nonetheless, our source material is limited in that Josephus is both inconsistent and also shows contempt for both groups.",0,74,485,771,M.

928,The Ghost Dance Movement and the Lakota Sioux,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Ghost Dance was a new religious movement founded by a Pauite Indian named Jack Wilson. After experiencing a spiritual vision of a heavenly realm during a solar eclipse on New Years Day of 1889, Wilson began to travel and preach a message of universal love and nonviolence to Indians across the present-day Western United States. Wilson was a spiritual leader among the Northern Paiute (a people who inhabited present-day Nevada) and commonly referred to as ""Wovoka."" This entry focuses on the practice and religion of the Ghost Dance, but especially on how Wovoka's movement took hold among the Lakota Sioux near the turn of the 20th century. Most historians accept that the persistent practice of the Ghost Dance by the Lakota as one of the most significant factors which lead the US military to attack and murder hundreds of non-combatant Lakota people at Wounded Knee Creek in South Dakota in the late December of 1890. This event, until relatively recently, was known as the ""Battle of Wounded Knee."" However, there has been a push in the field to call it what it was: The Wounded Knee Massacre.

The Ghost Dance itself consists of a traditional circle dance, where many of the participants fell into ecstatic trances and chants. While the ecstatic states and mix-gendered dancing that the ritual entailed grated puritan sensibilities, what made the ceremony threatening to US citizens and military leaders was the ideology and beliefs that lay at the foundations of the dance. Wovoka, as did many spiritual leaders before him of the Paiute, prophesied the return of the dead and the overturning of the current hegemonic [white] order. When the dead returned, they would expel the whites from the land, and traditional indigenous ways of life would return. Death and sickness would cease to exist, and all would reunite with their beloved dead. The Ghost Dance ritual itself was performed to hasten this return of the dead and the overthrowing of oppressive white settlers. Lakota Sioux especially emphasized the upheaval and transformation of the current order in their practice of the religion. Thus, it is easy to see why the method was disconcerting to white onlookers. 

However, critical to the coming of the dead was the strict adherence to a Christian-like moral code and an unwavering commitment to nonviolence. Wovoka forbade war between tribes and between Indians and the white man. He preached, especially against the practice of rituals which required self-mutilation, warned against lying and stealing, and encouraged all indigenous followers of his Ghost Dance Religion to work hard and earn money through the established systems of the emerging industrial economy. Therefore, while the Ghost Dance Religion was indeed apocalyptic, most scholars believe it primarily functioned to integrate indigenous people into modern society for the sake of Native survival. The thought goes that Wovoka was trying to ensure indigenous flourishing while providing something like a societal pressure valve and release through the apocalyptic hope and practice of the Ghost Dance.",1860,1910,1075,732,James Waters,5,Courtney Fitzsimmons,2020-08-01 01:52:38.301 +0200,2020-08-05 22:42:23.964 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),6.257328094103198e-16,3.3587401574658635e-30,5.822048299300364e-82,1.5859553832221034e-37,0.9999999999998743,1.2491908037537205e-13
929,Drikung Kagyu,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Drikung Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism is a subsect of the Kagyu school, whose main teachings were passed from Mahasiddha Tilopa (988-1069) to his disciple Mahasiddha Naropa (1016-1100), and from Naropa to the Tibetan master Marpa (1012-1097), who brought the teachings to Tibet. Marpa’s principle student was Jetsun Milarepa (approximately 1040-1123), who passed on the teachings to his students, including Gampopa (1079-1153) from whom the Karma Kagyu, Tselpa Kagyu, Barom Kagyu and Phagdru Kagyu sects were founded. Gampopa’s student Phagmo Drupa (1110-1170) was the teacher of the founder of the Drikung Kagyu sect, Jigten Sumgon (1143-1217). Jigten Sumgon was the grandson of Achi Chokyi Dolma, a great female practitioner who would later come to be a protective deity of the Drikung Kagyu. Jigten Sumgon founded the monastery of Drikung Thil in Central Tibet, which would come to be the center of religious activity for the Drikung Kagyu. The main teachings of the Drikung Kagyu are the Six Yogas/Dharmas of Naropa, the Jewel Ornament to Liberation of Gampopa, the Fivefold Mahamudra (thus named by Phagmo Drupa), the Gongchik of Jigten Sumgon, as well as the biographies and devotional songs of the great Drikung masters (most prominently the 100,000 songs of Milarepa). Up until the 17th century, power was primarily passed hereditarily within the Kyura clan. The Kyura lineage ended with the brothers Gyalwang Konchog Rinchen (1590–1654) and Kunkhyen Rigzin Chödrak (1595–1659). They were recognized as the 1st Chetsang (older brother) and 1st Chungtsang (younger brother). Both of these positions have passed through reincarnation up until present day. They are now held by Chungtsang Rinpoche Tenzin Chokyi Nangwa (b. 1942), who lives in Tibet, and Chetsang Rinpoche Konchog Tenzin Kunsang Trinley Lhundrup (b. 1946), who lives in India. Although the seat of the Drikung Kagyu is located in Central Tibet, Drikung Kagyu monasteries, retreat centers and dharma organizations have been established all over the world. The Drikung Kagyu enjoy significant influence in the Nangchen region of Kham, as well as in Ladakh and Dehradun (the site of the Drikung Kagyu seat in exile) in India.

931,The Society of Jesus (Jesuits) in Britain,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Jesuits are a Catholic missionary order that follows the tradition of St Ignatius of Loyola, the first Superior General of the Jesuits in 1541. The Jesuits are the largest Catholic order of men in the world, and their headquarters are in Rome, close to the Vatican. Pope Francis is the first Jesuit Pope. 

The Society of Jesus in Britain, commonly known as the Jesuits, came to Britain during a mission from Italy in 1580. Jesuits are neither monks nor friars but 'clerks regular'. They take vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience and live in community. Most are priests, but there have always been Jesuit brothers who assist the Society's mission without ordination. Many Jesuit priests also take a fourth vow, unique to the Society of Jesus, of special obedience to the Pope with regard to missions. Jesuit historiography in Britain can is typically organized by Jesuit activity pre and post suppression with regards to The Reformation in Europe. A significant aspect of the history of the English Jesuits after their restoration was their missionary outreach. New missionary endeavors by the English Province of Jesuits included began in 1837–94, and the English Province of Jesuits still maintains a mission in Guyana. The Jesuits first came to Guyana in 1857. Since then, we have been serving the Catholic Church & people in all parts of this beautiful, remote, and oft-forgotten South American country.

933,Marcionites,43,Religious Group (v6),"Marcionism was a branch of early Christian thought often deemed ""gnostic"" or heretical by detractors like Tertullian of Carthage. It is often associated with Marcion of Pontus, a second-century Christian preacher that came to Rome around 144 CE. Marcion is best remembered for his belief that Jesus was the Savior, but was sent by a God other than the one known to readers of Jewish Scripture. Instead of representing the God of Israel, Marcion believed that Jesus’s God was not the God that created the universe, but was a deity that was not known among humans until Jesus’s arrival.

Marcion is best known for his compilation of Christian texts. Marcion read the Gospel of Luke and ten of Paul’s letters, and some scholars have suggested that Marcion’s use of these eleven texts constituted one of our earliest Christian canons. Paul, as apostle to the Gentiles, was understood by Marcion to be one of the few early Christians who understood that Jesus preached a different God than the God of Israel. However, it is unclear of Marcion himself initiated the collection of Paul’s letters that he used, or utilized a collection already in use. The same goes for Marcion’s use of the Gospel of Luke. Some heresiologists argued that Marcion mutilated the Gospel text by removing particular scenes, such as the birth narrative of Jesus. However, it seems likely that Marcion used a version of Luke’s gospel already in circulation.

Early heresiologists like Justin, Tertullian, and Epiphanius preserve much of our information about Marcion and Marcionite Christians. However, their work is tinged with polemic and likely does not represent Marcion’s own thought, but rather what other Christians feared about Marcionite treatments of God, Christ, and scripture. They accuse Marcion of extreme asceticism and for treating Jesus as a human upon whom Christ descended, as well as that he divorces Jesus’s teaching from any continuity with Jewish scriptures.",144,1000,1080,754,Chance Bonar,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-02 18:11:17.199 +0200,2020-08-02 18:11:17.199 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.11232548458357267,7.909982099760738e-05,7.079067401342856e-45,3.687250938402082e-12,0.8875954155917424,5.081767477401812e-17
934,Mongolian Buddhism during the Revolutionary Period,43,Religious Group (v6),"At the beginning of the twentieth century, what is now the country of Mongolia, was a suzerainty of the Qing Empire. The country was divided into different banners ruled by nobles who could claim their legitimacy to their ancestral connections to Chinggis Khan. The nation was essentially feudalist, with noble families connected to temples who were often headed by reincarnation lineages. By 1911, when Mongolia declared independence from the crumbling rule of the Manchurian Dynasty, Buddhist monasteries connected to Tibetan lineages (mostly Gelug) had amassed considerable wealth and power in the preceding centuries. In the 1918 census around 110 000 people were monastics, around half of the adult male population. Around one third of these were celibate living within monastic compounds. The wealth of the temples varied greatly with some, such as the great estate of the Tibetan-born reincarnation the Eighth Javzandamba, ruling over 90 000 disciples. During the erratic beginnings of the twentieth century, Buddhist institutions saw a short-lived consolidation of their power as the Eighth Javzandamba took a position of seniority over the nation from 1911. In 1920, following a series of escalating incursions from the south, a group of revolutionary Mongolians travelled north in search of Russian assistance. In 1921 a group of White Russians, led by the notoriously brutal Russian Baron Ungern-Sternberg, arrived in the capital Khüree (now Ulaanbaatar) removing Chinese authorities and re-installing the power of the Eighth Javzandamba. Dismayed by the continued presence of the ‘Mad Baron’ in the country, in July 1921 the group of revolutionary Mongolians returned, backed by the Bolsheviks and entered the capital to oust the Baron’s army. Following the Eighth Javzandamba’s death in 1924, in 1926, the new socialist government began a campaign to undermine the power and influence of the monastic establishments. Initially this campaign was relatively non-violent and set about to decrease the wealth and authority of Buddhist institutions through heavy taxation and education campaigns. From 1929 to 1932 the country saw intensified violence against monasteries, followed by a reprieve when the excessive use of force and the destruction of sacred items caused uprisings and rebellions. Following this period posthumously named ‘The Leftish Deviation’, the government returned to mostly non-violent strategies, encouraging class consciousness among the poorer herders and disciples and increased the taxation of the temples. In 1937 the policies once again turned violent under the rule of prime minister Choibalsan, focusing on campaigns against Buddhist lamas, ethnic Buryats, intellectuals and other sources of opposition. Monasteries were destroyed and looted, lamas forcibly disrobed, and around 13 000 lamas were killed. As Christopher Kalponski writes “In September 1937, there had been 83,203 lamas in the monasteries. On 25 July 1938, there were 562.” By 1940 there were 251 lamas left in the country and for the next 50 years the government continued its policy of religious repression. The public practice of religion was outlawed, with only one monastery, Gandantegchenlin Khiid, functioning as a showcase for the nation’s religious tolerance.",1911,1940,1081,751,Saskia Abrahms-Kavunenko,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-03 11:26:42.728 +0200,2020-08-03 11:26:42.728 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.23405411081333957,0.0035522360883608575,0.5187625931091818,0.20368966864408986,0.03994139134502779,2.145113801917298e-27
935,Nigerian Pentecostalism,43,Religious Group (v6),"Pentecostalism has become a major cultural force in Nigeria since the early twentieth century, accounting for approx. 63% of Nigerian Christians today (World Christian Database). The success of Pentecostalism across Nigeria and Africa more widely has resulted in the widespread absorption of Pentecostal styles of worship into 'mainstream' African Protestant and Catholic churches (the latter known as 'Charismatic' churches). Pentecostals emphasise the active presence of the Holy Spirit both in worship settings and beyond, evidenced in miracles, healings, prophecies, tongues (glossolalia) and other 'gifts of the Spirit'. Nigerian Pentecostals tend to regard their religious faith as a means by which to ‘break’ with their ‘pagan’ heritage, and becoming born again as a way to be delivered from indigenous African spiritual and cultural life (Meyer 1998). Some Pentecostal churches place a strong emphasis on tithing and material success (‘Prosperity’), whilst others are more focused on asceticism and purity ('Holiness'), or healing and exorcism (‘Deliverance’).
Pentecostalism in Nigeria is widely recognised to have unfolded in three phases. The first phase, known as Aladura, or the African Initiated/Independent Church movement, (1910-1930s) was led by Yoruba itinerant preachers like Joseph Ayo Babalola who clashed with missionaries on the use of medicine (Peel 1968). The Aladura movement, meaning ‘praying people’, emphasised prayer, healing and deliverance from traditional 'pagan' religion. In this period, foreign Pentecostal denominations like the Classical Pentecostal church, Assemblies of God, and the Welsh Apostolic church also laid down roots in Nigeria.
The second wave, known as the 'Latter Rain' revival, took place in the 1950s and was initiated by British and American evangelists like Sydney Granville Elton and Oral Roberts. This phase emphasised deliverance, healing and also apocalyptic eschatology.
The third wave, known as the Neo-Pentecostal movement, emerged in the 1960s-80s and was heavily influenced by ideas and trends introduced to Nigeria in American evangelical literature. Open air revivals, especially on university campuses such as the Universities of Ibadan and Ife, led to an influx of young converts to the movement. Some denominations emphasised Holiness and millennialism (1970s) whilst others propagated the Prosperity Gospel (80s onward). This period saw the emergence of the Nigerian Pentecostal megachurches like Deeper Life Bible Church and the Church of God Mission International. Moreover, since the 1990s, demonology, spiritual warfare and the practice of Deliverance have become increasingly popular features of Nigerian Pentecostalism.",1910,2020,1082,810,Naomi Richman,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-03 16:14:12.377 +0200,2020-08-19 14:46:38.745 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.3412467525412253,0.01790339207249303,0.3944581880027071,0.2459790309276492,0.0004126364559255177,7.039800353179728e-32
937,Vestal Virgins,43,Religious Group (v6),"Introduction: No other religious group for women in antiquity has the same amount of written and visual evidence than the Vestal Virgins of Rome. The order of the Vestal Virgins belonged to the pontifical college (collegium pontificum) and was one of Rome's largest and most illustrious religious orders that spanned roughly a millennium. Their centrality to Roman religion and the Roman state is demonstrated by the fact that their lodging quarters was located on the Roman Forum itself that was, for most of its history, the civic center of the Roman Republic and Empire until Emperor Theodosius closed the Vestal Order in AD 394.
Even the antiquity of the Vestal Virgins described in ancient literature demonstrates their importance to Roman culture, and especially the wealth fare of the state. The Vestal order was said to have originated in the times of the legendary king Numa (Cic. Rep.2.64.14; Dion Hal. Ant.Rom. II.64.5-67.1; Ov.Fast.6.357-260; Plut.Num. 9.5), but the very first Vestal Virgin in Roman mythology was Rhea Silvia: the mother of Romulus and Remus (Livy I.4.2; Dion. Hal. Ant.Rom.I.75.1-77.4; Ov.Fast.2.383-86, 3.11), thus, the Vestals Virgins were even older than the city of Rome!
Selection Process: In order to become a Vestal Virgin, a rigid process overseen by the Pontifex Maximus ensued that scrutinized the girl’s age (no less than six and no more than ten years old), legal status (originally patrician, but later plebeians could enter), and physical condition: her virginity had to be absolute, since this was the most important qualification. An extant description of this process is recorded in Aulus Gellius’ Atticues Noctes I.12.1-8 in which other physical requisites, such as not having any impairment to hearing or speech, and exemptions are detailed. Though rather young by modern standards, the age of seven in Roman society allowed a girl to participate in both public and private rituals. Furthermore, nearly ninety percent of girls died before the age of six and those that did were more likely to survive into adulthood and fulfill the thirty-year requirement of the Vestal order. Wildfang also postulates that the age of six aided in detecting any physical defects, especially speech impediments. Finally, Wildfang also argues that the limit of the age of ten, is to ensure that a candidate’s virginity is intact before she underwent puberty.
Once the candidates passed the requirements, it seems that the Pontifex drew lots in public during the Roman Republic according to the Lex Papia. DiLuzio notes the scholarly debate around the Lex Papia (68 BC) in which the stipulation of drawing lots “e populo” suggests that, perhaps, at the time, plebein daughters could be candidates for the priesthood. Some evidence suggests that plebein order could participate in the Vestals as far back as 337 BC, where the Vestal Minucia was executed for incestum as Livy (VIII.15.7-8) and scholar Rüpke note.
To conclude our remarks on the selection process, it is important to note some changes during the Roman Empire. DiLuzio has shown that in AD 5 Augustus opened-up the Vestal Virgins to the daughters of freedman as well when there was a shortage of candidates. Then, under Tiberius, senators could offer their daughters directly when a vacancy occurred at the death of Occia and, thus, abrogated the 20-candidate necessity.                                                                                                                                                                        
Initiation Rite: The initiation rite, what is called a “captio”, is also described fully by Gellius (N.A. I.12.13-14). The Pontifex seized the selected candidate by the hand from her father and pronounced the words: sacerdotem Vestalem, quae sacra faciat quae ius siet sacerdotem Vestalem facere pro populo Romano Quiritibus, uti quae optima lege fuit, ita te, Amata, capio (Thus, I take you, Amata, just as she was of perfect law, as a Vestal priestess to do the sacred rites that the law permits the Vestal priestess to do on behalf of the Roman people). Many scholars, such as DiLuzio, Santinelli, and Mary Beard, have noted that the ritual bear a marked similarity to those of a Roman wedding in which the bride is also taken away from the lap of her mother in a simulated abduction. Furthermore, the Vestal dressed her hair in the seni crines (six-tressed) style that was also used by brides in the Roman wedding. As DiLuzio notes, these details a symbolic wedding between the Pontifex and the Vestal virgin. Parting with Beard who sees this rite that marked the Vestal as an interstitial figure, DiLuzio rejoins that it symbolizes the complete transition of the candidate from a private, domestic figure into one in service of the Roman people and state by removing her from her house.  
Duties: The legal, ritual, and privileges conferred to the Vestal Virgin depended upon her ability to maintain perpetual virginity, a quality that, apart from the Vestal Virgins, was not valued in ancient Roman life generally. DiLuzio notes that this need for perpetual virginity parallels concerns for ritual purity and that in the Roman mind these were one and the same for the Vestal Virgins. Furthermore, their virginity also symbolized the health and welfare of the Roman state. For example, Dionysius of Halicarnassus (IX.40) records a pestilence that affected Rome and, upon investigation, it was discovered that the Vestal Urbinia lost her virginity and was performing public rites. Upon the punishment of Urbinia and the two men, the plague was lifted. 
Another duty, which is also linked to their chastity, was to perpetuate the fire of Vesta, the goddess of the hearth (perhaps, as far back as the period of Roman monarchy in which Vesta was the goddess of the private, royal hearth) and heart of Rome as Staples and DiLuzio note. Dionysius of Halicarnassus (II.68) recounts that the fire of Vesta went out and a case ensued in which the Vestal Aemlia was tried. In asking for Vesta for aid, Aemlia cast her garment onto the altar and a great fire appeared as if giving proof to Aemelia’s service and chastity.",-800,394,872,733,Juan Dopico,18,Robyn Walsh,2020-08-03 17:28:58.351 +0200,2020-08-06 21:04:06.388 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.7293692756544364,0.01612205505800632,3.965084943099223e-12,0.23989370204631252,0.014614967237279588,9.688490787300555e-18
940,Julio-Claudian Imperial Cult,43,Religious Group (v6),"The term ‘imperial cult’ refers to the worship of the emperor and imperial family throughout the Roman Empire. Two factors make classifying and clarifying the practice of imperial cult difficult. First, religion was not separate from the political and secular sphere at Rome; as such it is difficult to determine whether the imperial involvement in religious practice was primarily driven by religious impulses as opposed to political motives. Second, because of the diversity of the Roman Empire, there is no unity to the practices of emperor worship. (In general, we distinguish between cultic observance in the Eastern empire, Western empire, and at Rome.) Bearing these two factors in mind, the following is an attempt to chart the beginnings of imperial cult under the Julio-Claudian emperors. 

The Augustan principate marked the transition between Republican and Imperial forms of government. However, the regime operated on the premise that Augustus, who was, post-Actium, simply an ordinary Roman citizen, restored the Republic. This façade made the operations of the cult especially problematic and the imperial household was deliberately obscure in the language it used to describe cultic activity (cf. Rives: 2007). Augustus himself was the son of a god: Julius Caesar had been divinised. Caesar’s career proved a beneficial model for articulating imperial divinity. Augustus used his divine genealogy to create an aura of specialness around himself; but he was equally aware that Caesar’s regal and divine posturing had contributed to sending him to an early grave. For more on Caesar and the cult see Weinstock: 1971.

Most scholars understand the worship of the emperor in the eastern provinces as a continuation of the customary practice of ruler-cult (cf. Cerfaux and Tondriau: 1957; Fears in Grant and Kitzinger ed. 1988; Klauck: 2003; Taylor: 1979). Augustus would not be unprecedented in this. Roman officials had received divine honours in eastern cities before (e.g. Marcus Claudius Marcellus in Syracuse from 212BC onwards); however, these examples are confined to single cities. Thus, a development came in 29 BC when temples to Augustus and the goddess Roma were granted to provinces in Asia and Bythinia-Pontus. However, the acceptance of these temples can be interpreted as an established method of assimilating Roman rule with the practices of the region.

Provinces requested the emperor’s permission before building temples to him and there are many examples of requests denied. It was common early on for the emperor to be associated with the goddess Roma as a way of softening the claim to divinity. In 15BC Hispania Tarraconensis gained permission for a temple to Augustus and Rome (cf. Fishwick: 2014) and in 12BC three provinces of Gaul established an altar to Augustus at Lugdunum (Livy, Epit. 139). These examples set a precedent for one way we can understand imperial cult. In general it was used to create cohesion and unity throughout the empire (cf. Gordon in Beard and North ed. 1990). Cult practice brought neighbouring communities together in acts of worship; it also cemented their relationship with Rome. As such imperial cult was a tool for empire building. 

The situation at Rome is even more complex; asking freeborn citizens to worship the emperor, however obliquely, was a delicate process (cf. Price in Bowman, Champlin & Lintott ed. 1996). In 7BC Augustus had reorganised the cults of the 265 districts (‘vici’) of the city; henceforth officials worshiped the Augustan Lares and the emperor’s ‘genius’ at these shrines. Every Roman had a ‘genius’ and the worship of a paterfamilias’ ‘genius’ is attested; these shrines, therefore, might be more aimed at treating the emperor as a father figure. Indeed, Augustus was eventually granted the title ‘father of his country’ (‘pater patriae’). Moreover, it seems these shrines were primarily overseen by freedmen and so worship at them was directed not at the political elite. There is also evidence that Augustus’ ‘genius’ was worshipped in private households; again this could be understood as part of envisioning the emperor as a paternal figure and assimilating veneration of him with traditional ancestor worship.

After Augustus’ death in 14AD, the emperor Tiberius was equally guarded in his attitude to cult activities. Augustus was deified after death (as Caesar had been before him). This entitled Tiberius to also style himself a divi filius (son of a god). The key policy was to provide all due honour and respect to Augustus (Tacitus, Ann. 1.15; cf. Cowan: 2009). For living members of the imperial family, and the emperor himself, the situation was more difficult. Tiberius was selective in what honours he would receive and where he would have temples built. For example, though Tiberius accepted a temple to himself (together with the senate and Livia) in Asia, he refused one in Spain; his reason was, apparently, a desire to follow Augustan precedent in accepting some honours, but not to cheapen Augustus’ divinity by allowing widespread sycophantic worship of the current emperor to eclipse reverence for his divinised predecessor (Tacitus, Ann. 4.37). As with Augustus, the cult was still primarily located in the East, and worship of the living emperor was combined with an abstract divinity that signified allegiance to Rome (in this case the senate). It is telling, however, that Tiberius’ mother Livia was now also involved. We are gradually moving towards a situation where a family, and not exceptional individuals, are being marked out as super-human. 

Cultic practice took on a new complexion with Gaius Caligula’s ascension to the principate (37AD). A young man with apparent mental problems, Caligula marks a turn in the imperial government because he was the first emperor to ‘inherit’ based on family ties alone. Both Tiberius and Augustus had been great statesmen in their own right; at 25, Caligula had had little experience in government and military affairs. He seems to have been influenced by ideas of Hellenic ruler-cult, and perhaps even Egyptian notions of imperial divinity; sources record that he replaced the heads of the statues of the gods with his own image and sat between the Dioscuri in their temple to be worshipped with them. There is even serious suggestion that he set up his own temple in Rome with priests and a golden cult image of himself (Suetonius, Calig 22; Claud. 9; Dio 59.28.6; cf. Bilde: 1978). Imperial women also gained in influence: Caligula’s sisters appeared on coins associated with the goddesses Securitas, Fortuna, and Concordia (cf. Wood: 1995). When his sister Drusilla died in 38AD she became the first imperial female to be deified (Dio 59.11). Though accusations of madness and incest make for entertaining anecdotes in our sources, it is hard not to see an attempt on Caligula’s part to use Hellenic and Egyptian models of ruler-cult to secure his own imperial position. If he had come to power on the basis of his family, it might be beneficial to emphasise the exceptionality of his breeding. The experiment failed, however, and Caligula was assassinated in 41AD.  

Under Claudius, the penultimate Julio-Claudian emperor, we see further evolution of imperial cult practice. Governing after Caligula’s murder in 41AD, Claudius was significantly more cautious than his nephew in all areas. He appears to have reverted to Tiberius’ practice of bolstering the dead and deified and taking the spotlight off himself. This also helped raise the prestige of the family at the same time and under him Livia, the wife of Augustus, was deified (Suetonius, Claud. 11).  

After his conquest of Britain, Claudius agreed to a massive temple complex to himself at Camulodunum in the province (Tacitus, Ann. 14.31). Britain was a troublesome province and the use of the cult centred around the emperor’s person indicates the way in which the religion aimed to foster unity and adherence to the empire. There is no evidence that Claudius shared this temple with another divinity (cf. Fishwick: 1961): if this is so, it marks a crucial turning point in imperial worship, where the emperor and empire are being collapsed into the same idea. However, in a move similar to Tiberius, Claudius rejected a surfeit of temples. In a surviving letter to the Alexandrians he declines, and expresses his distaste for, a purported temple to himself (despite having such a temple in Britain already). The letter illustrates the difficulties in defining imperial cult practices throughout the empire. However, the information we have implies that successful emperors were cautious in their approach growing the cult slowly and never indulging in excessive honours for themselves.

Imperial cult was a useful weapon for growing allegiance to the empire and imperial family as the provinces expanded and the Julio-Claudian family attempted to retain power. However, it was a double-edged sword: too much self-aggrandisement could pave the way for ridicule and sedition. Thus, though the cult is slippery to pin down it is a fascinating index of the development of imperial power and growth in the period.",-31,68,132,767,Treasa Bell,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-04 18:30:00.660 +0200,2021-03-09 18:00:42.306 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.35549295585369833,0.018428456218344658,0.3771737452504567,0.24765329100646574,0.0012515516710343872,2.6534191993839788e-30
941,Chan Buddhists in early Qing period,43,Religious Group (v6),"Chan Buddhists refer to the religious practitioners of Chan, reflected in the Chan texts like “recorded sayings” and “lamp transmission.” It is believed that the legendary figure Bodhidharma from India first brought Chan to China. Eminent Chan patriarchs, especially the Sixth Patriarch Huineng (638–713), developed Chan Buddhism during the Tang-Song periods. When it came to the seventeenth century, the reprint and publication of abundant Chan texts marked the revival of Chan Buddhism in the early Qing Dynasty. Divided into two major lineages (Caodong and Linji), Chan Buddhists frequently used “encounter dialogues” and the act of beating and shouting to express their understanding of awakening. Chan Buddhism emphasizes intuition over textual study, the role of meditation in cultivating one’s mind, and the importance of master-disciple relationship in the transmission of dharma. Chan Buddhists affiliated with the same lineage were loosely organized as a group as shown in the documental evidence of dharma transmission. The Chan Buddhists disputed with each other about the criteria of enlightenment and the authenticity of the lineages of dharma transmission in their textual works, which stimulated the revival of Chan Buddhism in the seventeenth century. The religious group not only includes elite Chan Buddhists who authored voluminous works, but also common Buddhists and lay people who practiced Chan.",1600,1700,1087,789,Nan Ouyang,45,Matthew Hamm,2020-08-04 18:56:04.612 +0200,2021-09-29 20:43:09.513 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.8623986491975735,0.0007499943924430569,3.6082223875395147e-22,0.03367269482785197,0.10317866158213153,4.103386514497309e-18
942,African Methodist Episcopal Church,43,Religious Group (v6),"In 1787, roughly a decade after America’s independence from Great Britain and almost a century before Black Americans were guaranteed U.S. citizenship, a group of Black congregants walked out of Philadelphia’s primarily white St. George's Methodist Episcopal Church in the middle of the Sunday service. One of these protesters, Black Methodist minister Richard Allen, eventually founded America’s first independent Black denomination and its oldest formal Black institution—the African Methodist Episcopal Church. Described by W.E.B. Du Bois as the world’s “greatest Negro organization,” the AME Church is a Protestant Christian denomination aligned doctrinally with the United Methodist Church and organized in an Episcopal system. 

To tell the story of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, one must first turn to the history of Methodism, its antecedent. Originated by English minister John Wesley, the transatlantic denomination became ubiquitous in eighteenth and early nineteenth-century America through the revivals of the First and Second Great Awakening. Historians often remark on the egalitarian and democratic nature of these revivals. While it is important for us not to romanticize early Methodism, thereby ignoring Black people's experiences of discrimination and systemic racism within the religious culture and society more broadly, we can still recognize that some enslaved people managed to make a home for themselves within the Methodist fold and, to some extent, were even accepted into communal worship spaces. The fact that services were held in large, open-air fields created a come-one, come-all atmosphere, and ecstatic, embodied worship experiences were customary. It was into this Methodist culture that Richard Allen was converted as a seventeen-year-old enslaved person in 1777. And ten years later, when he led a group of Black Methodists out of St. George's, it was as a consequence of this Methodist culture that he protested. 

While the Methodism to which Allen had been introduced as a young man was more open to Black congregants, the religious culture he experienced at the turn of the eighteenth century was increasingly stratified by race. Although sizable numbers of Blacks had been evangelized by Methodists and even licensed to preach in the mid-1700s, white Methodists started to neglect earlier ideals of acceptance in lieu of pursuing respectability and becoming an established church. Among other practices, white Methodists began to deny Black members leadership roles within the denomination and some white Methodist preachers even refused to hold Black babies during infant baptisms, as historian Julius H. Bailey has shown. Separating from St. George's signified Allen’s rejection of the inequitable treatment of African Americans in Methodist spaces, his recovery of early Methodism’s egalitarian ideals and his articulation of a new religious vision that embraced the humanity of Black Americans. After starting a church of his own in 1794 (Mother Bethel AME), Allen and a collective of other Black Methodists established their own denomination in 1816 with Allen as the organization’s first Bishop. 

Commitments to racial justice and what twentieth-century AME minister and theologian James H. Cone would later name Black liberation theology have served as the cornerstones of the two-hundred-year-old denomination. In the antebellum period, AME churches served as posts for the Underground Railroad. During Reconstruction, Northern AME missionaries travelled southward to teach formerly enslaved people how to read. Today, AME churches provide community programming that, according to their mission statement, aims to “enhance the entire social development of all people.” Furthermore, missionization, particularly in Africa, has been a primary component of the church’s work, leading to the establishment of the denomination in over thirty countries.",1816,2020,1095,804,Mélena Laudig,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-04 23:10:43.804 +0200,2020-08-18 20:03:51.195 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.1717607297113643,0.0026928499074311187,4.3051639981851146e-11,0.8254636246269723,8.27957111806772e-05,4.000383796659122e-33
943,Moravian Missionaries in Nunatsiavut,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Moravian Church or the Unitas Fratrum, originated in early 15th century Bohemia, in what is now the Czech Republic. Moravians were the first large-scale Protestant Missionary movement, spreading across the globe. Missionary work, ecumenism, personal piety and an emphasis on liturgical music and worship are tenets of the Moravian faith. This entry focuses on Moravian Missionaries in Nunatsiavut, the Inuit self-governing region of northern Labrador. It tracks social changes along several centuries of occupation, as well as how Inuit resisted and accomodated Moravian beliefs and sociality. Moravians first journeyed to Labrador in 1752, after Johann Christiann Erhardt, a newly converted seaman, traveled to Greenland, where Moravians had started to evangelize Inuit in 1733, using to their advantage the connections to the Danish court of their leader Count Nikolaus Ludwig Zinzendorf (1700-1760). Erhardt became convinced that he would be able to communicate with and interact with Inuit across the Strait in British North America after reading travel accounts depicting Inuit in Labrador. The first attempt to establish a mission in Nisbet's Harbour failed, with members of the expedition supposedly killed. In 1771, the first permanent Moravian community is established on the Labrador Coast and called Nain, and soon follows a mission station at Okak in 1776, and Agvituk (now known as Hopedale) in 1777. Missionaries chose locations to set up stations based on Inuit hunting, fishing, and whaling grounds, hoping that establishing themselves near historical winter camps would encourage Inuit to ""settle"" near them. This ""settling"" was instrumental to the conversion process. It allowed missionaries to keep watch over Inuit, encourage them to attend Church and festivals, and gave them a large amount of control over the flow of European goods. Control over trade meant control over Inuit subsistence activities, as Inuit converts were obligated to participate in the Moravian cod and fur economy, rather than spending their time hunting whale and caribou, which Moravians discouraged. In 1831, a mission station was established at Hebron, located 80 miles north of Okak, in 1865 a mission station was established at Zoar south of Nain, in 1871 a sixth station was established at Ramah (it would be closed in 1907), in 1896 a mission station was established at Makkovik, and in 1904 the eighth and final Moravian mission station opened at Killinek, at the northern tip of Labrador. The Moravian missions in Labrador struggled financially throughout its history. Events that stand out include the 1918 Spanish Flu in Labrador, which killed more people proportionally in Nunatsiavut than anywhere else on earth, with a mortality rate of 71% at Okak and Hebron. The Spanish Flu was brought to Labrador by way of the annual Mission supply ship and spread rampantly through the coast. Because of the remoteness of the Labrador coast, missionaries served as doctors and administrators, as the governmental presence was minimal. Moravians, along with the provincial government, ran the residential schools in the region and were responsible for intense physical, sexual, and psychological trauma of Inuit children during the mid-late 19th century. The last missionary left Nunatsiavut in 2005, the same year that the region became self-governing. Community members continue to carry on certain Moravian traditions and many self-identify as Moravian, serving as ministers in their own communities. Many Nunatsiavut Inuit have also called for there to be a reckoning with the colonial violence inflicted by Moravian missionaries, particularly surrounding residential schools. Youth have also taken up the cause for a re-evaluation of Moravian presence in Nunatsiavut. There is currently a youth-led movement to change the name of schools on the coast named for Moravian missionaries such as Jens Haven Memorial School in Nain and Amos Comenius in Hopedale.",1752,2020,1091,788,Emma Gilheany,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-05 04:18:23.682 +0200,2020-08-16 18:31:47.681 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.10289570404474999,0.0027358469064437934,0.7991461272260284,0.09521348226147294,8.839561304797324e-06,2.7515748570704356e-34
944,Mohyla's Ukrainian Church,43,Religious Group (v6),"A community of Orthodox believers in Ukraine who abide to the standards and practices of the Orthodox religion renewed in the course of Petro Mohyla's (1597-1647) reforms in the seventeenth century. Petro Mohyla’s reforms were motivated by religious competition in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.
In the 1620s, aristocratic dynasties that traditionally supported the Orthodox Church in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth either converted to Catholicism, or disappeared. However, the Orthodox Church in Ukraine, received a new supporter in the figure of the Cossacks, armed men of diverse social backgrounds. In 1620, the Cossacks helped to elect a new metropolitan for the part of the Orthodox Church that did not recognize the superiority of the Pope. In 1632, the Polish king recognized equal rights between the restored Orthodox Church and the Uniate, Catholic and Protestant Churches of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1633, Peter Mohyla, an energetic scion of an aristocratic Moldavian family, became the head of the Kyivan Orthodox Church.
Mohyla’s tenure as the metropolitan marked the beginning of an important period in the history of the Ukrainian and Belorussian Church, characterized by reforms in religion and education. The learned circle of Petro Mohyla modernized the existing theological literature and introduced new genres such as collections of miracles and moral theology into the Orthodox use. To unify the liturgy and teaching of the Orthodox Church, Mohyla initiated a revision and publication of the “critical editions” of the main books of the Church such as the and the Missal (1629), the Orthodox Confession of Faith (1640), the Euchologion (1646). Trying to raise the status of the Orthodox Church in the Commonwealth, Mohyla and his circle closely followed the Catholic example of ecclesiastical modernization and even made steps to prepare the Orthodox Church in Ukraine for the second Union with the Catholic Church. Mohyla justified using Latin sources by saying that ‘there exist few Slavonic books on theology, and none at all on politics. Greek books are difficult to obtain, and they cost too much, while Latin books on these subjects are readily available (Charipova, 261). To address the problem of education, Mohyla founded the Kyivan Collegium modeled on the example of Jesuit academies in the Commonwealth in 1632. Changes in religious life also brought transformations in the religious art and architecture. New genres of theatrical plays on religious became popular and popularized by the Kyivan Collegium. The new influences became noticeable in iconography that emphasized the cult of the Mother of God and Marian piety.  
The followers of Petro Mohyla accepted fundamental works created during Mohyla’s timeline and developed new theological genres. The most prominent works produced by the generation that followed  Mohyla included collections of sermons by Lazar Baranovych (1620-1693), treatises on moral theology by Innocentyi Gizel (1600-1683), collections of miracles by Ioanykyi Galiatovs’kyi (1620-1688). This generation of religious scholars made a considerable influence on the Russian Orthodox Church by bringing new types of books to Russian markets and setting new standards for education, preaching and church discipline.",1620,1700,1101,812,Ievgeniia Sakal,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-05 06:13:18.219 +0200,2020-08-10 00:56:11.375 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.13390187634416284,0.02041268720004898,0.6812186787167952,0.1641904061149553,0.0002763516240376651,4.1377102687984646e-19
946,Nyingma (rnying ma),43,Religious Group (v6),"The Nyingma, or “Ancient” lineage refers to the oldest of the four major lineages of Tibetan Buddhism. Distinguished from followers of the later Sarma (Tibetan: gsar ma) lineages, which includes the Kadam, Sakya, Kagyu, and later Gelug, Nyingma refers to those who adhere to the earliest (pre-tenth century) translations of Buddhist teachings arriving in Tibet, as well as a series of treasure (T: gter ma) text revealed from the eleventh century onwards. Renowned for their adherence to a range of esoteric, predominantly tantric Buddhist practices, as well as unorthodox behavior, Nyingma followers served as motivation for periodic reforms throughout Tibetan history, each allegedly “returning” to the ethical roots and meditative discipline of Indian Buddhism. 

According to the Nyingma lineage, the primordial teacher is Samantabhadra (T: kun tu bzang po). Depicted without clothing and vivid blue in color, he represents the untainted wisdom of the all Buddhas of the three times and ten directions. In human form, the Nyingma lineage finds its roots in the Indian master Padmasambhava (T: pad+ma 'byung gnas) who is credited with introducing the first coherent and comprehensive presentation of the Buddhist path to Tibet. He is often referenced along with Shantarakshita (Sansrkit: Śāntarakṣita), the great Indian pandit, and Vairotsana (T: bai ro tsa na), the great translator, delineating the three most important early Nyingma thinkers. The historical center of the lineage is found in Samye (T: bsam yas) monastery in central Tibet. Constructed in the eighth century, Samye monastery was the first successfully constructed monastery in Tibet. After years of wrestling with demons, King Trisong Detsen (T: khri srong lde btsan), requested Padmasambhava to subjugate the antagonistic demon, which he did, and the monastery was miraculously completed overnight. 

Renowned today for their erudite descriptions of the Great Completeness (T: rdzogs pa chen po) meditative system, the Nyingma lineage experienced a resurgence in the fourteenth century with the renowned scholar-yogi Longchen Rabjam (T: klong chen rab ‘byams). Longchenpa, as he is commonly referred to, both revealed new treasure teachings and consolidated much of the existent tantric materials found within the early Nyingma lineage. His extensive writings on topics such as the nine vehicles (T: theg pa dgu; a defining religious shema of the Nyingma, the subtle body, meditation practice, and most importantly the Great Completeness, revived the Nyingma lineage during and after his life. 

Extending across the Tibetan plateau to include all three Tibetan states (Utsang, Kham, and Amdo), as well as Bhutan and modern-day Indian state of Ladakh, the Nyingma lineage flourished in many sub-lineages throughout the centuries, resulting in a vibrant array of contemplative and scholarly practices.",700,1959,1129,782,Justin Kelley,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-05 21:01:06.170 +0200,2020-08-14 07:09:49.817 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),2.9212414709960764e-14,8.938757874604565e-18,1.6268399823657092e-58,5.915031040246527e-25,0.9999999999999688,1.8624262084090727e-15
948,Christianity in Ephesus,43,Religious Group (v6),"Groups of Jesus-followers (aka ""Christians"") in the city of Ephesus and its environs, in the second and third centuries of the Common Era, prior to the official recognition of Christianity as a state-sanctioned religious group. The earliest Jesus movement missionary connected with Ephesus is Paul, who is said to have resided in Ephesus in the mid-1st century CE and who provides evidence for an early ""church"" there. In the second century, traditions developed identifying a spot on the nearby Ayasoluk Hill as the burial place of apostle John; there developed a tomb cult that would eventually become an important Christian holy site and pilgrimage destination. By the end of the third century, Ephesus had grown into a central hub of the burgeoning Christian movement, famous for its associations with the apostles Paul and John, presaging its later place among the civic centers of imperial Christianity. 
Besides Paul’s letters, other early Christian texts connected with Ephesus include the pseudo-Pauline Pastoral Epistles, the Johannine Epistles, the Acts of the Apostles, the Book of Revelation, Ignatius' Letter to the Ephesians, and the apocryphal Acts of John. The latter two sources are our best witnesses to second century Christianity in the area, though the contested provenance of the Acts of John renders its historical utility dubious. Collectively, our sources for early Christianity in Ephesus attest to a substantial, though still marginal, presence of Christian groups in the city in the first three centuries. Almost all of our earliest sources attest to conflict between groups associated with the city, suggesting that Christianity there was comprised of a diverse collection of groups. 
The partial and highly stylized nature of our earliest sources, however, frustrate attempts to discern reliable sociological information, especially whether and how Ephesian Christians were distinct from other Christian groups, Jews, and Greco-Roman polytheists. Scholars have sometimes suggested that an early Pauline strand of Christianity was ""overtaken"" by a competing Johannine tradition (see DRH entries on ""Pauline"" and ""Johannine"" Christianities for more on these groups), but our sources prevent any kind of clarity on that front. Utilizing material and literary evidence, Katherine Shaner has recently suggested that women and enslaved people played prominent roles in the earliest Christian communities in Ephesus.

950,The Religious Society of Friends,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Religious Society of Friends (Quakers)
The Religious Society of Friends, better known by the once derogatory and later reclaimed moniker “Quakers,” are a historically Christian group. One of many small religious sects to emerge in the wake of the English Civil War, the Quakers formed under the inspiration of the teachings of George Fox, a weaver turned preacher who elevated the “priesthood of the believer” to a hitherto unseen extreme. Fox argued for the abolition of the priesthood (or the laity, as Friends might say), in favor of a Christian community modeled on Fox’s understanding of the early church, one in which all were called to ministry and equally able to communicate with a divine “Light Within.” Fox and the early Friends seem to have been a premillenarian sect who felt Christ’s return was immanent and prepared accordingly, but by the 1670s the Friends had begun to internalize the second coming and institutionalize in earnest. Friends became notorious throughout England for the uniqueness of their theological and social practices—worshipping in silence, eschewing paid ministers and tithes, refusing to use the “pagan” names of months and days, adopting plain clothes and the informal “thou” in place of the honorific “you,” refusing to doff hats for anyone but the Lord, and, most importantly, their refusal to swear oaths in courts of law (after Matthew 5:34) which led to their frequent imprisonment.
Even after the Friends were granted formal toleration in the Toleration Act of 1689, a number chose to immigrate to the New World, driven by economic and religious motivations. Though Friends began arriving in the Americas as early as 1655, they founded their most influential settlement in Pennsylvania (awarded as a charter to Quaker William Penn in 1681 to repay a lien owed his father), where Friends remained the dominant force in the legislature until 1756, when they resigned en masse rather than dedicate taxes for the French and Indian War, objecting on pacifist grounds. Though never a numerically significant portion of the American population, Friends assumed outsized importance in American religious history by spearheading a variety of social movements: The American abolition movement, women’s suffrage, Native American rights, and pacifist movements all have Quaker origins and inspirations.
A series of schisms split the American Quakers in the nineteenth century, following the trajectory of many Protestant denominations at the time. The most significant was the 1827 Orthodox-Hicksite split, the Hicksites rallying around the teachings of Elias Hicks, who taught that Jesus became Christ but was not born divine, and that any modern Friend who might follow Jesus’ example in discerning the will of the Inward Light within all. For Hicks, the Bible was valuable as one source among many attesting to God’s previous revelations but was not the unique word of God and should be subordinated to reason and experience. Orthodox Friends, by contrast, affirmed the traditional Christian beliefs that Christ was the sole Son of God who was sent to earth to redeem humanity by dying on the cross. Orthodox Friends increasingly integrated with other Protestant denominations in both theology and practice, while Hicksite Friends grew closer with other progressive denominations active in social movements. The split foreran the two most important Quaker bodies today, the liberal Friends General Conference (FGC) and evangelical Friends United Meeting (FUM). FGC Friends have maintained the distinctively quiet (“unprogrammed”) style of Quaker worship but are arguably post-Christian, while FUM meetings are effectively Protestant. The two groups share little with one another except competing claims to a shared spiritual lineage and the Quaker name itself. 
The Quakers were not historically known for missions after their initial proselytization efforts in the seventeenth century, but a series of successful international missions initiated in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries have led to large Quaker communities in Kenya, Burundi, Guatemala, and Bolivia. These international meetings are typically, though not invariably, affiliated with either the Evangelical Friends or the Friends United Meeting, and so more closely resemble other Protestant Christian churches than the more liberal FGC Friends. Over a third of the world’s Quakers live in Kenya, the likely provenance of the next stage of Quaker history.",1652,2020,1125,803,Andrew Taylor,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-06 18:03:17.959 +0200,2023-02-27 17:07:01.866 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),4.108099849769811e-23,1.702230100520811e-24,5.859448695864608e-22,0.9999942057891162,5.794210883812244e-06,1.4445327588086362e-34
952,Ethiopian Jews,43,Religious Group (v6),"A Jewish community of people who lived in Northwestern Ethiopia and shared a common language, culture, and history until a majority of the community emigrated to modern Israel in the 1980s and 1990s (1984-1991) in the aftermath of a series of social, political, and economic crises, commonly referred to as the Aliyah from Ethiopia. Approximately 150,000 Ethiopian Jews currently reside within Israel. 5,000 Ethiopian Jews remain in Northwest Ethiopia where they have waited over 20 years to migrate to Israel. Those who migrated to Israel during the aliyah have settled in a variety of cities within modern Israel where they have continued to maintain their ritual practices and cultivate new religious traditions and beliefs. Separated from Ashkenazi, Sephardic, and Mizrahi Jewish communities, Ethiopian Jews have cultivated their own ritual traditions, including dance, music, ideas about the Sabbath, and the practice of legal interpretation. In particular, debates and questions about Ethiopian Jews' knowledge of the Talmud or Oral Torah of Judaism persist with Israel's chief religious institution, the Rabbinate, refusing to categorize Ethiopian Jewish authorities, known as the kesim, as rabbis due to their perceived lack of knowledge of the Oral Torah. However, in 2018 the Israeli government formally recognized the kesim as the religious leaders of Ethiopian Jews and promised to put twenty kesim on the government payroll. Formal recognition of the kesim always involved instituted a government committee over the kesim which would supervise and regulate their activities. Some have criticized this attempt to formally recognize the kesim and argued that it will cause more problems and issues with the government now given the right and ability to survey and regulate Ethiopian Jewish authorities. As a result of these ongoing political complexities over the status of Ethiopian Jews, their legal status as Jews has and continues to be increasingly called into questioned and debated. In recent years, Ethiopian Jews living in Israeli cities have increasingly confronted social, economic, and political discrimination in the country which have led to widespread national protests and confrontations with authorities. While discrimination and marginalization remain persistent issues, Ethiopian Jews have increasingly integrated into Israeli institutions, including Israel's leading hi-technology companies, social services, and government agencies, with the first Ethiopian Jewish woman elected to a ministry position in May of 2020.",1980,2020,1104,816,Amanda Furiasse,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-06 23:13:24.653 +0200,2020-08-15 03:42:23.852 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.7816888332202019,6.380052955834415e-05,5.538143870289649e-33,0.11432112869997026,0.10392623755026957,7.248675472421237e-19
953,Sachchai,43,Religious Group (v6),"Sachchai is a loosely organized group of believers who aim to heal their suffering and illnesses through the means of Bible study, ritual exorcism, and speaking in tongue. Sachchai is rapidly spreading across villages and towns in Nepal. Hundreds of thousands of believers have embraced it. More than ninety percent of the believers are women who mostly are from poor and low-caste backgrounds. Sachchai claims to be an inclusive, egalitarian, and universal group. People from any religious and cultural background are welcome and they do not need to abandon their past religions and cultures. But the believers are required to believe in Jesus and study the Bible. Other synchretist faith-based groups like Sachchai are also found in South Asia. For example, Christ-Bhakta followers in Tamil Nadu, India, who identify themselves as Christ-Bhakta Hindus, and Jesus Imandars in Bangladesh, who identify themselves as Isa-Muslims (Jørgensen 2008; Kuttiyanikkal 2014) . Both these groups study the Bible but do not disassociate themselves from their past religions.   

Sachchai was established by Christian evangelicals in the late 1970s in India but could not prosper until the first decade of the 21st century when it got fertile ground in Nepal. Extreme political instabilities, huge international labor migration of men, dire lack of public services, and, most importantly, rising domestic violence against women, all have contributed to the rapid expansion of Sachchai. Hindu nationalists and Christians in Nepal both have considered Sachchai as a threat to them.",1975,2020,1140,790,Amar BK,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-06 23:48:59.994 +0200,2020-09-11 03:33:41.523 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),1.6752498929874992e-23,1.7452818658457238e-25,3.9511799310640676e-44,0.999924540139616,7.54598603840444e-05,9.130477591409752e-22

957,Spartan Religion,43,Religious Group (v6),"Ancient Spartans, known also as Spartiates, lived in the city of Sparta, a settlement located in the region of southwest Greece known as the ‘Peloponnesos’. Positioned between the between the Eurotas River and the Taygetos mountains, Sparta during the Archaic and Classical periods controlled a large territory that included the regions of Lakonia and Messenia. Having subjugated the native populations of these regions during a series of conflicts thought to have taken place during the 8th-7th centuries BCE, the Spartans instituted a system—attributed to the quasi-mythical Spartan lawgiver Lycurgus—by which a small caste of full-citizen Spartiates were supported by the unfree agricultural and commercial labor of oppressed non-Spartan inhabitants of Lakonia and Messenia (known as ‘perioikoi’ and ‘helots’). Uniquely unconstrained by agricultural or economic obligations, Spartiate males devoted the majority of their time to rigorous physical and military training from the age of seven onwards. The educational system at Sparta, supposedly another Lycurgan initiative, specialized in the cultivation of civic and martial virtues such as bravery, obedience, and self-control, as well as physical prowess and mental acumen; physical training for Spartiate women also existed to promote the generation of strong and healthy children. As a result of this system, the Spartans maintained one of the most powerful and respected armies in all of Greece during the Archaic and Classical periods, and it is this martial aspect of Spartan society that remains most well-known today. || 

Beyond the reputation of the Spartans as formidable warriors, however, many aspects of Spartan society remain shrouded in mystery. Little written evidence regarding Archaic and Classical Sparta has survived unto the present day, and of the ancient sources that do survive, very few of them record contemporary Spartan perspectives. François Ollier first coined the term ‘le mirage Spartiate’ to describe this conundrum of attempting to reconstruct Spartan society from the testimony of outsider perspectives, most of which postdate the period in question and present an idealized account of Spartan society. Much of the ancient evidence concerning Sparta comes either from the period of Roman Greece, when Sparta was greatly admired by the Roman Empire, or from the 5th century BCE, when Sparta and Athens were locked in a struggle for the supremacy of Greece. Fueled by the ideological conflict and the perceived insularity of ‘conservative’ Spartan society, 5th-century Athenian writers tended to project their feelings about Athens—whether positive or negative—onto the antithetical ‘blank canvas’ of Spartan society. || 

If reconstructing Spartan society remains a difficult task on its own terms, then reconstructing Spartan religion is even more challenging due to the scarcity of written evidence and the strong localizing tendencies of Greek religion. During the Archaic and Classical periods, each city-state in the Greek world practiced its own expression of a more universal ‘Greek religion’. Deeply embedded in a city-state’s civic institutions, these so-called ‘polis religions’ fused local religious traditions with aspects of Panhellenic belief and practice. In reconstructing Spartan ritual practices and festivals, every attempt has been made to temper the accounts of later writers such as Pausanias and Plutarch by turning to the testimony of archaeological evidence, particularly that excavated from Spartan sanctuaries and shrines under the auspices of the British School at Athens. In the absence of -emic sources concerning Spartan religious beliefs and cosmology, much of this material has been reconstructed from the testimony of early Greek poets such as Homer and Hesiod. ||",-800,-300,1142,809,Sarah M.

958,Society of Jesus,43,Religious Group (v6),"Revered and reviled. Saints or devils incarnate. These and other stark dichotomies have dogged the Jesuits throughout their nearly five-century history. That history was born with a second birth; that is, the conversion of a Basque nobleman after the battle of Pamplona in 1521. A cannonball struck the knees of Iñigo Lopez shattering them and his hopes for a career as a courtier. Yet, instead of crippling him, the injuries he sustained transported him into a whole new life, the life of the spirit. His meandering path in the life of religion brought him to unexpected places from Montserrat, to Jerusalem, to Barcelona, to Paris and ultimately to Rome; and to a surprising destiny: the founder and first Superior General of a religious order, the Society of Jesus.
Paul III officially approved of the Society on September 27, 1540 and in so doing ratified their first formula and institute in which the Jesuits laid out the plan for their common life. In that document the Jesuits commit themselves to a wide variety of ministries of the word including giving the Spiritual Exercises, striving for the progress of souls, partaking in works of charity, educating children and the illiterate. In addition to these pursuits, the Jesuits took a special fourth vow, beyond the three traditional evangelical vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, of obedience to the pope to undertake missions anywhere in the world. It was in these latter two capacities that the Jesuits became most famous. 
As the Society rapidly grew from ten to one thousand from 1540 to 1556 so too did its commitment to education. While they were involved in some form of teaching from the outset, their first formal foray into schooling for primarily lay students began in 1548 with the foundation of their school at Messina, Sicily. After that date, schools quickly sprang up in nearly every city where there were Jesuits, and practically every place that did not have a Jesuit school wanted one. Devoted to a rigorous humanist education in the classics, grammar, rhetoric, and other burgeoning arts such as history, while maintaining their instruction in faith and good morals the Jesuits became the teachers par excellence of the early modern period. Indeed, students of the caliber of Moliere, Voltaire, Descartes, and many other attended their schools, which helped earn them their reputation for educational excellence. Even contemporaries, such as Francis Bacon, commended the Jesuit efforts in education in his own writings on education reform.  
Their schools were not limited to the confines of Europe. In fact, schooling was a major part of their missionary endeavors where they taught both Europeans and indigenous populations alike. The Jesuits were adept missionaries, with a unique style of accommodation. Their educational background in languages encouraged them to learn the languages of indigenous populations and prepare grammar books for those languages in an effort to teach others. Jesuits explored and frequently wrote about the new cultures they interacted with as well as the new environments, flora, and fauna they encountered. As a result, they published many ethnographies, but also letters that they sent on an annual basis to Rome, known as the Jesuit Relations. These letters electrified European audiences thirsting for knowledge of faraway lands and inspired many young men to become Jesuits. 
Outside of these two ventures the Jesuits also excelled in preaching, the study of theology, and even as patrons of the arts. They produced some of the greatest theologians of the time including Francisco Suarez and Robert Bellarmine. Similarly, they had relationships with the greatest artists of the day such as Michelangelo, Bernini, and even numbered the great painter and art theorist Andrea Pozzo among their own.
Still, wherever the Jesuits succeeded they also seemed to draw harsh criticism. This was especially true in their missionary endeavors where detractors accused them of using the mission fields for the purpose of acquiring land and riches. Similarly, as theologians, many of their ideas became controversial. Dominicans and later Jansenists (including Pascal) accused them of neo-Pelagianism on account of their insistence on the role of free will in salvation. 
These criticisms, added to various political intrigues, fueled the flames that eventually led to the general suppression of the Society of Jesus in 1773. Over the two hundred and thirty three year history of the “Old Society” the Jesuits achieved many major accomplishments and earned the ire of many detractors. To some they were saints to others devils incarnate. They were reviled as much as revered.",1540,1773,498,799,Thomas Santa Maria,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-08 02:16:19.454 +0200,2020-09-14 17:16:30.487 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.15137024127075294,0.0018823109852138206,2.850134305168053e-11,0.8454279690766145,0.001319478638917348,2.6158883343444376e-32
960,Bön (Bon),43,Religious Group (v6),"The word ‘Bön’ (Tib. Bon) represents a complicated and contested term, carrying various meanings across time, space, and different groups. Presently it usually refers to the more specifically called Yungdrung Bön (g.Yung drung Bon), literally ‘Eternal Bon’, on which this entry focuses – a religious tradition academically mostly taken as a school of Tibetan Buddhism. The other recognised main schools are: Geluk (dGe lugs), Nyingma (rNying ma), Kagyü (bKa’ rgyud), Sakya (Sa skya), and Jonang (Jo nang). Yet, Bön has historically maintained a strong non-Buddhist and minority identity, accentuating own appellation bön in opposition to Buddhism, chö (chos). Yungdrung Bön is currently spread, as the other schools, in the culturally Tibetan parts of the PRC – with largest communities in East Tibet (Sichuan, Gansu, Qinghai Provinces); in the Himalayas: Nepal (Mustang, Dolpo, Kathmandu), following the post-1959 exile also in India (Himachal Pradesh, thinly in Uttar Pradesh, Sikkim, Ladakh), Bhutan, and growing globally: in Europe (with a monastery in France), USA, Canada, Mexico, Mongolia, and venturing into South-east Asia. 
Attested meanings of the term bön refer to: (1) ‘bönpo’ (bon po) ritual specialists conducting funerary rites and invocations of deities in the Tibetan Empire (7th-9th century) controlling a great part of Central Asia, with ‘bön’ likely denoting ‘ritual’; (2) all historical and contemporary Tibetan religious notions and practices that do not derive from Buddhism and Indian influences, i.e. mainly popular religion encompassing traditions sometimes labelled ‘shamanism’; in an extended understanding non-Buddhist elements of Tibetan culture, a notion currently popular in Tibet and propagated by the PRC (along with strong Chinese historical impacts); (3) Yungdrung Bön; (4) (lha)bön ((lha) bon), or sipé lhabön (srid pa’i lha bon), local traditions generally lacking Buddhist influence unrelated to Yungdrung Bön, centred on mundane rituals, worshipping a range of own divinities, found in small areas of East Tibet and the Himalayas (mainly Bhutan, Arunachal Pradesh). 
Bönpos, adherents of Yungdrung Bön, have asserted own succession of the Imperial bön, which they regard as an independent Tibetan autochthonous religious system, gradually suppressed by Buddhism (officially adopted by the Tibetan Empire in the 7th century) and a predecessor of bön (2), (3), (4). According to historical evidence, Yungdrung Bön begun crystallising in the 11th century under the influence of Buddhism during its second diffusion in Tibet, developing monasticism and adopting other Buddhist features. Yungdrung Bön has thus shared cosmology, soteriological goals (awakening), and key features of ritual and spiritual practice with Tibetan tantric Buddhism, but has maintained more Tibetan non-Buddhist elements. The non-Buddhist identity is very strong and derives from own sources of tradition and lineages of power and teachings: divine founder of the religion Tönpa Shenrap Mibo (sTon pa gShen rab mi bo), claimed to significantly predate Buddha Shakyamuni and hail from the Zhangzhung (Zhang zhung) kingdom in West Tibet; own canon: voluminous Ka (bKa’, ‘The Word’ or ‘Teachings’) and Katen (bKa’ rten,  ‘Support of Teachings’) collections; distinct iconography and details of material culture; also deliberate inversions of Buddhist categories (for instance anti-clockwise circumambulation).",1000,2020,1107,736,Anna Sehnalova,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-08 16:38:52.622 +0200,2020-08-21 16:24:56.212 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.9527047075942724,0.0017022460900688698,5.712005175967749e-43,2.5643094972210062e-33,0.04559304631565875,2.534679022885124e-17
961,Romanian Orthodox Church,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Romanian Orthodox Church (henceforth ROC) is an Eastern Christian denomination. It represents the largest religious group in Romania (86.45% in 2011). Although the first evidence of Christianization of modern-day Romanian territories (Lower Moesia) dates back to the 3rd century, this entry’s time span runs from the achievement of the status of autocephalous Metropolis of Romania in 1885 – following the creation of the Kingdom of Romania in 1881 – up to the present day. The Metropolis of Romania was eventually raised to the rank of Patriarchate (its current jurisdiction) in 1925. The ROC is structured in Romania (thus excluding its dioceses abroad) into twenty-nine dioceses, fourteen of which have been established since 1990 (seven have been just re-opened after the communist leadership had disbanded them and another seven have been newly established). The Patriarch is the head and representative of the Romanian Orthodox Church, but decision making is the prerogative of the Holy Synod, which meets twice per year. The Holy Synod, which is the highest authority of the ROC, is formed by six Metropolitanates, sixteen Archbishoprics and thirteen Bishoprics with jurisdiction in Romania, plus some representatives for Romanian Orthodox communities abroad, including the Republic of Moldova. On a local scale, Bishoprics and Archbishoprics are divided in Protopopiates and, eventually, in parishes, which are the smallest units (Tateo 2020: 62).
The theological framework organizing the orthodoxy and the orthopraxis of the ROC is the same of the other eight Eastern Orthodox churches, which are all autocephalous but in full communion with one another. The Romanian Orthodox faithful worship with particular devotion Saint Nicholas, Saint Parascheva, Saint Filofteia, Saint Andrew, Saint George, Saints Constantin and Elena, and Saint Dimitrie. The Orthodox Easter is the most important feast day of the year, while weekly services revolve around the Sunday mass. Pilgrimage to monasteries is a crucial form of religious practice which gathers thousands of believers every year: the Saint Parascheva is the largest one and takes place at the Metropolitan Cathedral of Iaşi on October 14th. The most popular Orthodox monasteries in Romania are Putna, Moldoviţa, Suceviţa, Voroneţ, Prislop, Cernica, and Sihastria.

963,The Knights Templar,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Knights Templars, or the Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon, were a Christian religious military order founded in the early twelfth century whose history is inextricably linked to the crusades. Originally founded to protect pilgrims visiting the Holy Land in the decades after the First Crusade from danger as they crossed through Muslim-controlled areas, the organisation soon expanded its duties. The order’s knights, those men who were highly skilled in military warfare (at most around 10%), came to play an important role in the defence of the Crusader States, while non-combatant members managed a large economic structure throughout Christendom, making use of innovative banking techniques. 

All took vows of poverty, chastity and obedience, and promised to devote themselves to God's service just as members of other religious orders did. Its constitution guaranteed the organisation’s structure form the mid-twelfth century onwards, at the top of which stood the Grand Master, initially stationed in Jerusalem (while under Christian control) and later in Acre. He was elected for life and assisted by other high-ranking members, including the Grand Commander and Marshal. Directly below were the provincial preceptors of the Templar territories who commanded the sergeants (or 'servientes'), non-elite members who had usually joined from the lower social classes and supported the knights on the battlefield or served as craftsmen or labourers. There were also priest-brothers within the Order who were responsible for the spiritual needs of all members. Both elite and non-elite members came from all over western Europe. 

They initially found support among many secular and religious leaders, who made significant donations to the order in aid of their cause, thereby allowing the order to grow significantly and acquire great wealth. However, the tide began to turn at the end of the thirteenth century. At the end of the thirteenth century, little remained of the Crusader States which had been established nearly two centuries earlier and many resented the order’s significant power. Finally, in 1307 King Philip IV of France order the arrest of every Templar in France, falsely accusing them of immorality and heresy. This move gained the support of Pope Clement V and led to the violent persecution and death of many members.",1119,1312,1110,811,Emma Zürcher,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-09 14:11:33.811 +0200,2020-08-13 15:12:27.359 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),1.8300115106214e-11,0.9995674718021821,1.1298141424962646e-11,4.559436576458066e-22,0.00043252816821956735,4.690163083063813e-19
965,Pachomian Monasticism,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Pachomian monastic federation was a group of ultimately eleven monasteries, including two women's monasteries, affiliated under centralized leadership in Upper Egypt in the fourth to sixth centuries CE.  

The founder and central figure, Pachomius (c. 292-346), was born to a pagan family.  During his time serving in the Roman imperial army, he was inspired by the kind treatment he received from Christians, and ultimately embarked on an ascetic life.  He apprenticed himself to a local ascetic, after whose death he began his own community of ascetics.  After an unsuccessful first attempt, he established a monastery at Tabennesi (c. 323), the first of the monasteries that either were established or joined his federation over the course of the fourth century.  

After Pachomius’s death, there was a struggle to establish succession, but ultimately two more strong leaders, Theodore (d. 368) and Horsiesius (d. c. 387), took the reins and kept the federation thriving during their lifetimes.  Most of the primary source material we have dates to these eras.  We have much less data concerning the following century and a half, but the Pachomian federation appears to have continued during this period.  Sometime between 537 and 548, the Roman emperor Justinian I supplanted the Monophysite Pachomian leader Abraham with a Chalcedonian replacement, at which time many monks fled, effectively ending the existence of the Pachomian community.  

This group is sometimes described as the first Christian cenobitic monastic community, but this characterization is not strictly correct.  It was certainly the largest and most organized up to its time, but many others had been practicing a semi-removed ascetic and communal lifestyle for years already. For example, at least three of the eleven monasteries in the federation were not founded by the Pachomians, but joined the federation after independent origins.  The federation’s innovation instead came in its extensive organization in part facilitated by the Pachomian Rule, which provided a practical guide that helped in the regulation and functioning of the community.

The Pachomian legacy’s lasting influence is seen in other Christian cenobitic enterprises including Shenoute’s monastic community in Upper Egypt and Benedict of Nursia’s monastic Rule.",323,548,1112,818,Tola Rodrick,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-09 22:30:33.638 +0200,2020-08-18 00:31:58.385 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.10289570404474999,0.0027358469064437934,0.7991461272260284,0.09521348226147294,8.839561304797324e-06,2.7515748570704356e-34
966,"Naqshbandī Order, Naqshbandī Tarīqa, Naqshbandīyyah, Khwājagān,",43,Religious Group (v6),"The Naqshbandī Order refers to a range of Sufi brotherhoods beginning in Central Asia in the 14th century c.e. and spreading geographically through offshoots such as the Naqshbandī Mujaddidī in South Asia during the 17th century and the Khâlidī branches beginning in the 19th century within the Ottoman Empire. The namesake of the order Bahāʾ al-Dīn Naqshband was born in 1318 c.e. and died in 1389 c.e. in a village near Bukhara known as Qasr ʿĀrifān and studied under the Khwājagān Sufi master Amīr Kulal. One of the common identifying features that distinguish Naqshbandī order from others is it’s Silsila, or the chain of transmission of its teachings. While most Sufi orders trace the chain of transmission from the prophet Muḥammad through the fourth Caliph and first Shīʿī imam ‘Alī ibn ʾAbī Ṭālib, the Naqshbandi trace their teaching through the first Caliph Abu Bakr Al-Ṣadīq. This is known as the Naqshbandī “Golden Chain” (Ar. Silsilat al-dhahab). Another unique feature of Naqshbandī orders is the practice of “silent recitation of God’s name” (dhikr-khafī) also known as “dhikr of the heart” (dhikr al-qalb) as opposed to “vocal dhikr (dhikr-i jahrī)” or “dhikr of the tongue” (dhikr al-lisan). The practice of silent dhikr combined with an aversion to musical audition (samāʿ) represent the “sober” rather than “intoxicated” expression of Sufism that characterizes the Naqshbandī orders. Finally, the Naqshbandī orders are characterized by a tendency toward social and political engagement. This is articulated in Bahā’ al-Dīn Naqshband’s preference for “companionship” (suhbat) over isolation (khalwat), and the principle of “solitude in the crowd” (Per. khalwat dar anjuman) which stressed that followers need not abandon their trades or economic activity for the sake of spiritual pursuits reflecting a Malamati Sufi attitude toward “livelihood” (kasb) prevalent in Central Asia. Along with another of Naqhband’s eleven principles--“travelling in one’s homeland” (safr dar watn)--Naqshbandi Sufis were encouraged to actively engage in society which may be seen from  ‘Ubaydullah Ahrar’s (1404-1490) land-holdings and influence in Timurid politics, to the prominent role of the Naqshbandiyya-Khalidiyya in resisting the Russian Empire’s expansion into the Caucasus during the 18th and 19th centuries.",1318,2020,1113,757,Adam Tyson,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-10 08:42:31.607 +0200,2020-08-15 02:25:38.942 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.1260666023517078,0.0026586257021786845,0.7355090202515056,0.13556990717930117,0.00019584451530677124,2.5014109832965167e-33
968,"Anabaptist Mennonites in North America, 1683-2021",43,Religious Group (v6),"Mennonites are a religious group that arose out of the Radical Reformation of the broader Protestant Reformation in Western Europe in the early sixteenth century. They were called Anabaptists, “rebaptizers,” by religious and political authorities who persecuted them for baptizing adults upon their confession of faith rather than baptizing infants, which was the legislated practice of the time. In north Germany and the Netherlands, Roman Catholic priest Menno Simons renounced his position in 1536 and became an influential Anabaptist leader. Mennonites take their name from him.

Anabaptist Mennonites fled persecution and migrated throughout Western Europe. Mennonites in the Swiss and south German territories fled further west into Germany and France, and in 1683 the first group immigrated to North America in Germantown, Pennsylvania. Many more followed, finding the Quaker William Penn’s offers of land and religious freedom appealing. The north German and Dutch Mennonites fled further east in a later wave of migration during this time. Mennonite migration to Canada occurred in the late 18th century from Pennsylvania in southern Ontario due to the Revolutionary War, as Mennonites generally hold strong convictions about practicing nonviolence. In the late nineteenth century, Russian Mennonites migrated to Kansas, Nebraska and Manitoba. In the early twentieth century, some Canadian Mennonites migrated to Mexico.

Anabaptist Mennonites range from conservative to progressive. Those on the most conservative end have isolated themselves from the surrounding culture to the extent of not driving cars or using electricity, dressing in distinctive homemade attire and maintaining their own language (often, a low German dialect called Pennsylvania Dutch). Those on the most progressive end interact with the surrounding society to the point of not being recognizably different, participating in government leadership and undergoing training at non-Mennonite public and private educational institutions. 

Mennonites in North America today live in nearly every state and province. They typically share common beliefs and values such as service, nonviolence, simplicity and an emphasis on community. In principle, Mennonites are not religious affiliated by birth, but voluntarily enter the community of faith by free choice. Because of this, any person can join the Mennonites regardless of having Anabaptist Mennonite ancestors.",1683,2021,1115,820,Sarah Bixler,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-10 23:21:50.850 +0200,2021-07-21 15:32:49.055 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),7.261116541739163e-12,6.464942694683989e-15,1.512046894980349e-32,0.9994666108248694,0.0005333891678630384,3.9755666155304335e-32
970,Cult of Isis (Mysteries of Isis),43,Religious Group (v6),"Unlike many other mystery cults in the Ancient World, the Cult of Isis capitalize on its exotic, Egyptian appeal. In this henotheistic cult, Isis, an attractive female figure, mother of Horus, and devoted wife to Osiris in the narratives, becomes the supreme deity alongside Osiris and Divine Providence that offers one solution to the theological crisis of the 2nd century AD (Gasparini). Her association to Greek and Roman goddesses ranged from Artemis to Aphrodite, as de Witt points out: in the Classical period Herodotus makes Isis equivalent to Demeter as a fertility goddess, but by the Empire Plutarch states that Isis was Mut and Atyhri as well as Athena. Elsewhere, Artemis and Isis were associated together. An aretalogy, moreover from Kyme, Asia Minor has Isis controlling even Fate whom even the normal Graeco-Roman gods obey. Finally, in Corinth, Isis becomes a goddess of the sea and trade, and the festival Isidis Navigium is celebrated for the beginning of the sailing season, and the celebration even entered the Roman Fasti (calendar) during the Empire. 
Turning to the myth of Isis in the Graeco-Roman world, no other literary texts gives a complete narrative than Plutarch’s de Iside et Osiride. Even Egyptologists, such as Gwyn Griffiths and Hani, refer to Plutarch’s text and consider him a good scholar on religious history. Furthermore, the cult of Isis appears in many Greek and Latin inscriptions and it also features prominently in book eleven of the novel Metamorphoses of Apuleius, where Lucius in the form of the ass enters the cult of Isis, is initiated, experiences a religious encounter with Osiris, and recovers his true human body. In the soteriological myth of the cult, Plutarch outlines how Isis resurrects Osiris who was dismembered under the moon and killed by Typhon (Sett). Isis manages to put the pieces of Osiris back together save his phallus – scholars have offered many attempts to solve this part of the myth, including that Isis knew of Osiris’ adultery with Nephthys. From the myth, comes the idea from Egyptian theology that Osiris is the judge of the dead, who, if the deceased’s heart is lighter than a feather, would allow the deceased into his blessed and eternal abode. Isis becomes the benefactor of mankind, and the clear implication of the general narrative is that devotees of the cult of Isis had hope in life after death and that Isis may raise them up like Osiris. Thus, it comes to pass that, as Witt notes, the cult of Isis develops a priesthood, festivals days, its own calendar, and a litany of sacred texts, such as the Andros Hymn and aretalogies that are found throughout the Mediterranean world. In the hymn, Isis gives the holy word (hieros logos) whose symbol is the linen garb to those who are initiated into her mysteries. 
The cult itself might have entered the Greek world during the Classical period, when the Athenian Assembly gave permission to some Egyptians to establish a temple to Isis in the Piraeus, as Simms has noted. From there on, in the Hellenistic Period, the Ptolemies – Greek rulers of Egypt – who used both Osiris and Isis to legitimize their pharaonic rule continue to spread cult activity primarily in Alexandria. Ptolemy I Soter was said to have invited a Timotheus to syncretize the Egyptian cult with Greek ideas, based on the Eleusian mysteries and Demeter worship (Witt). The Ptolemies and their wives, such as Arisinoe II, would continue to use the cult in order to establish their political authority by associating themselves with Osiris and Isis. From Alexandria, the cult spread to the rest of the Greek world and arrived to Delos. Scholars have traced that the cult’s arrival to South Italy originated from Delos when merchants were forced to flee due to conflict with the Seleuccids. In Italy, the cult can be found relatively early in the 3rd century BC in the Greek speaking portions – Sicily and Magna Graecia through numismatic and archaeological evidence, such as temples at Puteoli and Pompeii (Rüpke). From there, in the 1st century BC, the cult of Isis enters Rome under Sulla, and the Pontifex Maximus Metellus funded the construction of an Isis shrine (Iseum Metellinum). The cult, however, did not enjoy immediate success. Among the non-aristocratic classes, the cult offered an alternative and a challenge of the authority of the Senate in competing with the gods of Jupiter and Venus (Rüpke). The Roman Senate sought to ban the cult activities in the 50s and 40s BC and political violence involving factions of Pompey and Clodius involved members of the cult of Isis. During the Civil Wars, Antony and Cleopatra fashioned themselves as Osiris and Isis which led to Octavian, after his victory at Actium in 31 BC, to prohibit the cult from entering the pomerium of Rome. The hostility towards the cult reached its pinnacle in Tiberius when in AD 19, a Roman by the name of Mundus seduced a married Roman matron Paulina with the aid of the priests of the temple of Isis. Upon investigation, Tiberius banned the cult, destroyed the temple, crucified the priests, and banished Mundus into exile. From there, under Caligula and Nero, the cult of Isis enjoyed prestige and became one of the most popular mystery cults throughout the Mediterranean until the arrival of Mithraism and Christianity. With Theodosius edict to close all pagan temples in AD 394, the fate of the cult was pretty much sealed, although there is some evidence to suggest that in certain peripheral areas the cult lasted until the 6th century AD.",-323,500,132,733,Juan Dopico,18,Robyn Walsh,2020-08-11 23:06:52.508 +0200,2020-08-15 19:42:12.300 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.12142246937808293,0.003463234735444574,0.7718220055582372,0.10320045997687509,9.183035136016592e-05,3.3313145787395867e-31
971,Gāṇapatya,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Gāṇapatya Sampradāya denotes a cluster of religious denominations whose worship and devotional systems are centered upon Gaṇeśa (Ganapati), the elephant-headed son of deities Śiva and Pārvatī. Members of the sampradāya are also referred to as Gāṇapatyas. Most modern Hindus regard Gaṇeśa as a god who helps petitioners overcome various kinds of obstacles. Reflecting this belief, he is usually invoked at the beginning of most formal pujas as a precautionary measure to ward off anticipated hindrances, hypothetical or otherwise. Gāṇapatyas expand this common Hindu position to interpret Gaṇeśa as the supreme manifestation of the supreme reality (brahman). 

Although archaeological and scriptural evidence point to Ganesha's emergence as a recognizable deity in the first years of the common era, it is currently impossible to indicate a precise founding date for the Gāṇapatyas. Paul Courtright, the renowned American scholar of Ganesha, identifies the duration from the 6th to the 10th centuries CE as the likely time span of their early development. Some texts report that at least 6 different Gāṇapatya maṭhas (institutions) existed contemporaneously with those established by the theologian Śankara in the 9th century CE. Between the 6th to the 16th centuries CE, historians have noted the construction of dozens of temples across North, West and Southern India with Ganesha enshrined as the principal deity. Additionally, scholars of Hinduism have called attention to the composition of different Puranas and Tantras during the same period that describe the elaborate rituals and mythologies of textually-grounded communities that self-identify with the Gāṇapatya label. 

While they appear to have died out as an independent sampradāya by the 17th century CE for reasons that will be illuminated in other sections of this entry, vestigial traces of Gāṇapatya-like practices continue to be observed in most forms of Indian religion. These practices are especially pronounced in Marathi-speaking areas. Courtright correlates the emergence of neo-Gāṇapatya movements in Maharashtra to political ascent of the Peshwas in the late 17th century. Appointed to serve as Prime Ministers at the court of the region's Maratha ruler, the Peshwas were largely derived from Chitpāvan Brahmin caste and worshipped   Ganesha as their clan deity (kuladevatā). They pioneered an elaborate display of the scripturally-prescribed, autumn Ganesh Chaturthi at their palace in Pune's Old City; these embellishments added amplified levels of grandeur to a festival that was hitherto observed as a domestic ritual at a simpler scale, subject to the discretion of individual families. These celebrations served to rekindle popular interest in temporarily-forgotten Gāṇapatya temples and the latter have since enjoyed a dramatic rise in patronage from Hindus of all sampradāyas. 

In the 1890s, the Pune palace's Ganesh Chaturthi ceremony was re-engineered by freedom fighter and religious reformer Bal Gangadhar Tilak into a festival celebrated almost entirely in the public domain. In the ensuing decade, the popularity of Tilak's remodeled ritual inspired the creation of countless ""Ganpati mandals"" (Ganesha committees) across Maharashtra, all dedicated to the organization of a 10-day long puja in honor of Ganesha that attracted participants from across the spectrum of Maharastrian castes. Scholars of Marathi religion like GS Ghurye and Anne Feldhaus have remarked that the universalization of Ganesh Chaturthi has enabled nationalists to itemize neo-Ganapatya beliefs as a distinctive marker of a Hindu-Marathi identity that continues to be mobilized in opposition to region's other religious influences. 

In more recent years, the Mumbai-based Bollywood film industry has frequently highlighted the worship of Ganesha, thereby motivating the reproduction of Ganesh Chaturthi festivals in other Indian states and in international cities that have large populations of Indian immigrants. All of these details notwithstanding, the residue of Ganapatya worship constitutes an essential aspect of modern Hinduism. A deeper investigation of this sampradaya reveals significant insights qua the nature of Indian religion at disparate historical moments.",500,2020,1135,795,Aditya Bhattacharjee,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-12 06:05:18.365 +0200,2020-08-21 08:43:10.091 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.0008467271798917832,2.3369955757022845e-08,9.773816698046404e-69,1.4068421469307096e-36,0.9991532494501425,9.890100081406724e-15
972,Nestorian Christianity,43,Religious Group (v6),"Nestorian Christianity as a distinguished Christian group came into existence after the Christological movement that held the theological position initially developed by Nestorius (4/5 CE). Nestorius considered Christ the Son of God and Christ the son of Mary as two separate persons with two natures rather than one person having human and divine nature. That Christological teaching was officially condemned by the Council of Ephesus in 431. The Council of Ephesus anathema led to the separation of the early Church, development of the Nestorian doctrine and ultimately initiated the process of creating the so-called Church of the East. The teaching of the Church of the East as it developed throughout history should be distinguished from the initial Nestorian teaching. Theological differences quickly had political and socio-cultural implications at the global level (relationship with the Western Church as well as other Christian communities in the East).

Historically speaking, Nestorian Christians played an important role in bringing Christianity to China as well as other regions like Mongolia and India. The historical timeline of Nestorian Christianity depends on the region, socio-cultural setting and date of missionary penetration. 
The bilingual (Chinese-Syriac) Nestorian stele (8th ct) from Xian witnesses to the early 7th century presence of Christians in the area. Nestorian Christians also reached India, and interacted with many other groups as Mongols, Turks, and Uigurs.  Members of the Nestorian community played an importan role during the Islamic period when they translated many works by Aristotle into Arabic (e.g. Timothy I). Modern Assyrian Church of the East is the successor of medieval Nestorian Christians, but its doctrine today should not be identified with Nestorius. After the disintegration of the Mongolian Empire during the 14th century, the Church of the East faced rapid decline. In the aftermath of these events, the presence of Nestorian Christianity was mainly reduced to India and Mesopotamia. During the 16h century, some members of the community united with the Roman Catholic Church and were named Chaldeans, whereas those who did not united with the RCC became known as Assyrians. Nestorian Christians faced persecutions in Persia during the 6th century, but flourished in China (7-10th ct), and was also well received during the medieval Mongolian period.",431,1500,1121,770,Srecko Koralija,18,Robyn Walsh,2020-08-12 15:59:03.660 +0200,2020-08-15 20:44:08.278 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.39387269098179467,0.0017661135345630615,6.544312045573728e-11,0.602003973099483,0.0023572223187162985,2.82321458728219e-32
973,The Sarna religion of the Oraons of Jharkhand,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Indian state of Jharkhand is the homeland of 32 Scheduled Tribes (ST) and eight particularly vulnerable tribal groups.  According to the 2011 census, about four million Jharkhand residents are ST and the Oraon, who follow the Sarna religion, are about million. They are counted as ""other religions and persuasions"". The Sarna religion is based on animism and is sometimes called Addi Dharam.  They believe in a benevolent spirit and reply upon it for their overall wellbeing. The term 'Sarna' refers to a Sacred Grove or place of worship (which is usually a  Sal tree of the Shorea robusta species). The sacred grove is a small patch of forest that is protected because it is sacred and the site of deity worship. 'Spirits of the forest' are said to dwell in the roots of Sal trees, and 'spirits of the village' are said to reside in the most ancient of the Sal trees of the Sarna, or sacred grove of the village.  The tribal version of Sarna when we consider this linguistically offers a very pertinent explanation of the term Sarna. In Kurukh (Oraon language) there is a term called ''Saara Baana'' which means 'work to be accomplished'. In such a way, the place where all the wishes and works are accomplished is called Sarna. Controlling these events are different types of spirits: ancestral spirits, spirits of people who died unnaturally, or forest spirits. The sacred place is home to the deity Sarna Mai. Furthermore, people’s activities are based around propitiating, through blood sacrifice, spirits that happen to reside in nature. The Mundas and the Santals go to Sarna/Jaher for most of their religious rites, but Oraons go to Sarna only once a year. This yearly visit is for Khaddi, or the Sarhul feast, and the remaining have their own specific places of worship. The highest divinity or Supreme being, the creator of the Universe recognized by the Sarna Oraon is Dharmes. He fosters all living and non-living things. They believe that spirits control all the goods and the ills of life, like earthquakes, cyclones, and floods.  Second in the hierarchy are the spirits of naturally dead ancestors, called Pachbalar. Later sections belong to the village deities and spirits (Bansakti, Banjaribhut, Chatur-Siman-Garhadhora, Tusa-bhura). The fourth section are the spirits of hunting and war, called Chandi, worshipped by men; and spirits which protect pregnant women from the evil eye, called Joda and Achrael, worshipped only by women. The religion is organized around many tribal groups throughout Chattishgarh, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Assam, and West Bengal.",1845,2019,1136,616,Meenakshi Munda,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-12 17:16:33.308 +0200,2020-09-08 11:45:41.989 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),1.2537023619063393e-35,0.9506468305801713,1.2484315133721857e-58,2.487058468645093e-47,3.6022652911671765e-14,0.04935316941979262
974,"Greek Chalcedonian Christians, Nicaea",43,Religious Group (v6),"The empire of Nicaea existed from 1204 to 1261. Following the capture of Constantinople (modern Istanbul), many elites and the patriarch of the capital city moved to nearby Nicaea (modern Iznik), and this arrangement continued until 1261 when Constantinople fell to Michael VIII. Though predominantly (even almost exclusively) a Greek speaking, Chalcedonian Christian polity, it sat at the crossroads of polities comprised largely of Slavic Chalcedonian Christians, Roman Chalcedonian Christians, and Sunni Muslims. The mass movement of ecclesiastical hierarchy ensured, on the one hand, a general continuation of religious practice as it stood prior to the move, but led, on the other, to the development of new saints’ cults and religious festivals. 
By the 1220s, the political capital had moved largely to Nymphaion, almost 400 km from Nicaea, where the patriarch and the religious authorities remained. There remained, nevertheless, close ties, even with somewhat increased independence. The Greek patriarch, in exile from the traditional see in Constantinople, found a home in various monasteries and churches in Nicaea, while still maintaining a strong claim to the Constantinopolitan throne. A kind of intellectual bifurcation arose: they were on the one hand banished from their home, while on the other, they had found a safe, and quasi-paradisiacal, refuge. 
The disruptive time from 1204 to 1261 does not seem to have produced any major discontinuities from a previous or later period, but perhaps new, and sometimes contradictory, emphases. Anti-Latin polemics, which had been present for centuries, heightened, but efforts towards union with the Roman church continued under the guidance of several emperors and patriarchs. There seemed to be a common vacillation between anti-papal and functionally pro-papal stances. The Roman state had long seen itself as a new Israel, and now the language of Israel in exile continued. Penalties against Jews, however, did not subside and indeed increased. Although occasional alliances with the Seljuks occurred and emperors sought the support of Seljuk leaders, a more favorable stance towards Islam does not seem to have arisen. 
New devotions appeared and certain old devotions increased. St Tryphon became a dynastic, and his feast became a major celebration during the time in Nicaea, which seems to cool after the return to Constantinople. Devotions to St John the Theologian and the Theotokos, long present in Roman society, increase and persist after the move from Nicaea. The devotion to the Theotokos may be seen even on seals and coins.",1204,1261,1124,817,Nikolas Churik,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-12 20:37:15.382 +0200,2021-05-18 06:01:02.590 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.11142904221384904,0.0002946150097132455,5.975075451822126e-22,0.884534430799012,0.0037419119774256488,6.956328946045256e-32
975,Neo-Charismatic Movement - Third Wave Charismatic Movement,43,Religious Group (v6),"Pentecostal and Charismatic practices of speaking in tongues through the Baptism of the Holy Spirit had become accepted within many mainline Protestant denominations and the Roman Catholic Church by the 1960s and 1970s. However, many evangelical traditions and churches continued to resist charismatic renewal practices and theologies during the rise of the Second Wave Charismatic Renewal Movement. Charismatics were viewed with suspicion and their practices were critiqued and mocked within evangelical circles.  

Yet, evangelicalism was not immune to change during the 1960s and 1970s. The hippie-led Jesus People Movement took hold in the United States during this time. Young barefoot preachers would encourage their peers to turn away from drugs, accept Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior, and join a new type of church that emphasized a come-as-you-are vibe with casual dress and provided rock and roll as part of their worship liturgy. In addition, many of the new hippie converts were interested in Charismatic practices of healing and witnessing through signs and wonders. The Jesus People Movement led to the formation of new independent evangelical churches that identified as non-denominational and some of these churches embraced Charismatic theology and practices.

One of the church movements that emerged in the late 1970s was the Vineyard Church in Southern California. The Vineyard was a collection of churches that broke away from Calvary Chapel due to the Vineyard’s desire to emphasize Charismatic practices and theology. On Mother’s Day in 1980, Pastor John Wimber of the Vineyard Christian Fellowship in Orange County, CA and invited a former Calvary Chapel pastor and the face of the Jesus People Movement, Lonnie Frisbee, to preach. Frisbee’s message on healing and the subsequent ministry of healing that took place that morning launched the start of the Vineyard Movement and subsequent Neo-Charismatic movement. This new Neo-Charismatic movement blended evangelical theology with charismatic practices of healing, supernatural prayer languages, and an emphasis on miraculous signs and wonders as a component of evangelism. 

John Wimber began to teach at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, CA and was influenced by C. Peter Wagner’s research on church growth as well as George Ladd’s Kingdom of God theology. Wimber was able to influence numerous people to start their own independent charismatic churches and ministries as a faculty member and through his conferences that he hosted where he taught on how to minister using supernatural signs and wonder. Wimber developed the concept of “power evangelism” where adherents evangelized using signs and wonders rather than Bible tracts that were popular in the 1960s and 1970s.  

By the 1990s, new independent churches and movements that were evangelical and charismatic were rapidly emerging throughout North America. These included the Toronto Blessing Movement began in 1994 at the Toronto Airport Vineyard Church. Bethel Church in Redding, CA installed Pastor Bill Johnson as their senior pastor in 1996. The International House of Prayer Kansas City was founded in 1999. These Neo-Charismatic churches and others have become popular and controversial for their encouragement of the miraculous, their non-formal style of liturgy, and theological stances on healing, anointing, and supernatural power.

C. Peter Wagner coined the term “Third Wave” charismatic movement to describe these new churches and ministries. Their emphasis on power evangelism, charismatic forms of worship, healing, prayer languages, operating in signs and wonders, and their emphasis on anointing leaders as apostles and prophets made them distinct from traditional Pentecostal churches and Charismatic Renewalists within mainline traditions.",1980,2020,1018,762,Nathan Womack,5,Courtney Fitzsimmons,2020-08-12 23:23:50.552 +0200,2020-08-20 07:03:33.628 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.05722106101119321,0.00034797271176552775,5.597313596273358e-12,0.9423786018892849,5.2364382158968576e-05,6.0391814150919745e-33
976,Mising Community,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Mising community identifies as tribal and indigenous to Assam with migratory connections to the adjacent state of Arunachal Pradesh, in the northeastern region of India. They find definitive mentions in written sources, such as the Ahom Buranjis of the Ahom kingdom in Assam, from approximately 12th-15th centuries AD. They are listed as a Scheduled Tribe but are attempting to get 6th Schedule status. The 6th Schedule is a Government of India legislation that provides tribal autonomy in judicio-administrative proceedings of areas designated as Scheduled Areas. 

The community speaks Mising, a Tibeto-Burman language which is seen by several scholars to mark its migratory connection with the Sino-Tibetan and Tibeto-Burman region. They also speak Assamese. 

The Mising inhabit the Brahmaputra river valley along its northern bank covering several districts. This particular entry covers the Mising community living in small river islands known as the char region in Lakhimpur District, Assam. Surrounded by the Subansiri tributary of the River Brahmaputra, the chars are erosional spaces, some of which are submerged with the lashing of the floods each monsoon in the months of June and July. This char region is physically removed from areas across the river and require travel by ferries. 

The religion ascribed to by respondents from the river island area is understood as a mixture of Mising religious practices that focus on nature worship and Hinduism, specifically Vaishnavite Hindu practices. There is mention of the Vaishnava tradition being the first indicator of a conversion to Hinduism due to the popularity of the same in the region.  The Neo-Vaishnavite movement in Assam which is linked to spiritual leader Srimanta Sankardeva around15th century CE is often proclaimed as a socially 'integrative' and 'assimilative' force which saw tribal communities such as the Mising converting to Vaishnavism. 

The community continues to practice nature worship through several rituals honoring Donyi and Polo, referring to the sun and moon respectively.  Among other forces worshipped are asu(water), among(earth), asar(wind).
 
In 2019, there was seen to be a push amongst certain river island communities towards an increased emphasis on Donyi-Polo worship. That year, the BJP government won several tribal council elections and built alliances with Mising political parties.",1187,2019,1133,823,Nimisha Thakur,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-13 13:18:23.560 +0200,2020-08-20 10:27:15.312 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.26575935277831775,0.020686269170999895,9.859061296332887e-44,1.2782138593103187e-12,0.710247067897806,0.0033073101515980912
977,Chishti Sufis,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Chishtis are a Sufi order of immense influence in South Asia, founded in Chisht, Afghanistan, in the tenth century and brought to South Asia in the late twelfth century AD. It is considered the oldest of the Sufi orders operating in the region, and has enjoyed patronage from rulers and politicians throughout its history. Divided into sub-branches, the Chishti order is still influential today. 

The order quickly spread across South Asia even before Delhi’s political ascendancy, with early lodges (khanqahs) acting as sites of influence in Bengal, Gujarat, Malwa and the Deccan. Scholars have noted that such expansion indicates how the order was able to assimilate to social life in these areas; it is likely that for early adherents, Islam was synonymous with the teachings of the local Chishti shaykhs. This focus on adapting to local conditions has also been cited as a reason for their historically close relationship to local rulers and nobility. 

In the eighteenth century, the majority-Muslim qasbah towns of the Upper Doab emerged as sites of Chishti influence.

In Chishti sacred geography, the city of Delhi is especially significant. The shrine of Shaykh Nizamuddin Auliya (d. 1325) is an important site of pilgrimage: each year, the six-day urs ceremony held on the anniversary of Nizamuddin Auliya’s death attracts 150,000 people from across the country. Rulers based in Delhi helped to consolidate the shrine’s importance. Another important pilgrimage site is in Ajmer, Rajasthan, the burial place of Moinuddin Chishti (d. 1236). Emperor Akbar relocated the Mughal capital to the village of Fatehpur Sikri to be next to the site of shaykh Salim Chishti’s (d. 1572) khanqah. 

Though the shrines were always popular, membership in the Chishti order was associated with elites in Mughal times. From the late seventeenth century on, initiation into multiple Sufi orders became more common among prominent Muslim intellectuals, and many Muslim reformers of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries belonged to several orders. While pilgrimage and participation in festivals at shrines is widespread among South Asian Muslims (and some Hindus), formal membership in the order is now largely hereditary, as each Chishti shrine is maintained by a familial lineage of ‘sajjada nasheen’ or spiritual heads of the shrine, who wield power and influence as beneficiaries of donations made to the shrine and managers of its calendar of festivals.

Within the landscape of South Asian Sufi groups, the Chishtis are predominant. They are known for the importance of music in their religious gatherings: Chishtis are credited with the invention of qawwali music, a South Asian devotional genre which is sung on Thursday nights at many shrines and during the annual ‘urs’ festivals which commemorate the saint’s union with God upon their death. The Chishti order has historically been associated with what has been called a ‘syncretic’ culture in South Asia, merging elements from Hindu society in their devotional practices, for example in the rituals surrounding the tomb of the shaykh. 

The order defines itself based on a chain of authority (Silsila, meaning dynasty or literally ‘chain’) that links its spiritual leaders (shaykhs) to each other all the way back to the Prophet. Consequently, there are several sub-sects established at breaking points in this list of shaykhs, called a ‘shajra’, though these are not theologically distinct. In South Asia, the two main branches are the Chishti-Sabri (after ‘Alā-ud-dīn ‘Alī Sābir, d. c. 1291) and the Chishti-Nizami (named for Nizamuddin Auliya, d. 1325).",1200,2020,1127,815,Hallie Swanson,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-13 17:11:40.867 +0200,2022-11-08 23:40:33.341 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.8107364919268499,0.003996284874102994,1.76857921437731e-21,0.17072064389130792,0.014546579307739168,2.2822181351315126e-20
978,Indonesian Catholicism,43,Religious Group (v6),"As a part of the universal Catholic Church, Indonesian Catholicism features all of the rites, scripture, hierarchy present in Roman Catholicism. As anywhere, however, this world religion is expressed, understood, and practiced in accordance with the unique cultural history of Indonesia. Initially arriving with Portuguese traders in the early sixteenth century, Indonesian Catholicism has grown and flourished, becoming a powerful religious and political contender in the country and beyond. Demonstrating significant diversity across the archipelago, Indonesian Catholicism often integrates itself with local traditions and accommodates itself to the needs of different peoples.

Catholics have played important roles in Indonesian history, contributing greatly to the national character and vision. In the nation’s early days, Catholic politicians and religious figures opposed the movement to require adherence to Islam, advocating instead for religious freedom. The effects of these debates can be seen in Indonesia’s current policy of monotheism that recognizes six ‘official’ religions. One of Indonesia’s principle newspapers, Kompas, was begun by Catholics in the1960s to offer an alternative to the media and perspectives of the Communist Party at the time. Today Kompas is a secular newspaper.  As in many parts of the world, Catholic schools and hospitals have often provided excellent education and healthcare, especially in remote regions that the state initially had trouble reaching, in this country of over 17,000 islands. 

Demographically, Catholics make up only a small minority of Indonesia’s population: 2.91% according to the 2010 census, or about 7 million individuals. Of the 33 provinces existing during this census (room was made for a 34th in 2012), the provinces with the greatest number of Catholics were East Nusa Tenggara (54.14%), West Kalimantan (22.94%), and Papua (17.67%). East Nusa Tenggara is the only region where Catholics comprise a greater percentage of the population than any other religious group. Across Indonesia, 65% of Catholics live in the countryside, while the remaining 35% live in cities. Papua, West Papua, and East Nusa Tenggara are the poorest provinces in Indonesia (According to 2019-2020 data). 

The demographic distribution of religion in Indonesia, together with a lively culture of internal mobility and migration, means that certain ethnic groups have become associated in-country with Catholicism. Prominent among these are the Batak of Sumatra, some Dayak groups from Kalimantan, and some Chinese-Indonesians. Perhaps most well-known for their Catholic history and culture are the Florenese, whose yearly processions draw thousands of pilgrims from around the country. While members of these groups have gained recognition as propagating Catholicism in Indonesia, Catholics can be found across the country, of many different ethnicities and cultural backgrounds. Throughout it’s rich history, Indonesian Catholicism has contributed important ideas, values, and expressions both to the country of Indonesia and the global Catholic Church, strengthening the diversity of each.",1500,2020,1053,825,Meghan Rose Donnelly,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-13 17:55:54.231 +0200,2020-08-25 23:11:57.122 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.143405787990294,0.001173072465492947,0.32652207295669416,0.5284761310697097,0.0004229355178092967,1.28942495434975e-32
980,Pure Land Buddhist Schools in Early Medieval Japan,43,Religious Group (v6),"The rise of the exclusive practice of the chanted nenbutsu (Jpn. senju nenbutsu) was integral to the development of Buddhism in medieval Japan. It involves exclusively practicing single-minded invocation of the Buddha Amitābha (Amida)’s name with six characters, “Na-mu A-mi-da butsu”—literally meaning “Homage to Amida Buddha”—, by which to achieve salvation, birth in his Pure Land after one’s death. The teaching of the exclusive nenbutsu represents a major intellectual trend in medieval Japanese Buddhism, where liberation from saṃsāric rebirth was often thought to depend on a single practice or condition. The doctrinal root of the teaching lies in the thought of a Japanese Buddhist thinker Hōnen-bō Genkū (1133-1212). In the late twelfth century, Hōnen developed the radical claim that in the time when the Buddhist path is leading to its extinction, the entirety of this path should be encapsulated in a single practice of the chanted nenbutsu, through which he thought all sentient being will achieve birth in Amida’s Pure Land after death. While the chanted nenbutsu had been traditionally construed as one of least essential practices suitable only to those of lesser religious capacity, Hōnen claimed its centrality in the Buddhist path, because he conceived it as a sole practice that Amida found corresponding to his original vow to save all sentient beings. According to him, Amida’s selection of the chanted nenbutsu from multiple practices rendered all sentient beings equally benighted and thus urged them to rely completely on the other power of Amida’s original vow that already guaranteed salvation. This claim led Hōnen to even insist that all other practices that require self-reliant efforts are to be totally abandoned. Hōnen’s teaching was further developed by one of his disciples Shinran (1173-1262), who gave a clearer expression to the absolute other power of Amida Buddha. These two thinkers, Hōnen and Shinran, were later regarded as the founders of two prominent Pure Land Buddhist schools, Pure Land school (Jōdo shū) and True Pure Land school (Jōdo Shinshū) respectively. They promoted the exclusive nenbutsu to address primarily the soteriological equality. However, as their followers proselytized the teaching from the late twelfth century, it did entail social implications for considering whether even those persons who violate religious and social norms could attain salvation. The teaching was thus of great appeal to those deemed as the hard-to-save in medieval society. Among them were included warriors, whose profession was taking lives, and women, who was regarded as with heavy karmic hindrances. The exclusive nenbutsu, however, also entailed an openness to the antinomian impulse, serving to legitimize zealous followers’ excessive acts, such as licensed evil and intentional violation the precepts. This invited severe criticism of Hōnen, Shinran, and their followers from the religious authority of the time and urged the authority to engage in suppressions of the followers’ groups.",1175,1333,1141,826,Kentaro Ide,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-16 21:21:12.313 +0200,2020-08-25 07:47:18.463 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.33495848190378813,5.3945298721197924e-05,3.532033366141545e-34,0.03816031302223833,0.6268272597752523,2.3962021565151526e-17
982,The Samaritans (Persian to early Roman periods),43,Religious Group (v6),"The Samaritans are a religious group in the Abrahamic Tradition that originated in northern Israel. The group, which exists to the present day, traces its origins to ancient Israel and holds that their southern neighbors split off from them during the time of Eli. Ancient Samaritans worshiped the God of Israel and claimed that they, not the Jews, preserved the correct practices for worship. The separation between the two groups was gradual but would likely have been established by the time of (or as a result of) Hyrcanus’ destruction of the temple at Mt. Gerizim in the 2nd century BCE. 
The primary religious text of the Samaritans is called the Samaritan Pentateuch, or the Samaritan Torah, which contains the first five books of the Hebrew Bible. Traditionally, Samaritans regard the Pentateuch as the only authoritative biblical books. Although most of the differences between the Samaritan Pentateuch and the Jewish Torah are largely technical, the Samaritan Pentateuch includes several substantive differences, most of which are related to their claim that Mt. Gerizim, not Jerusalem, is the appropriate place for worshiping the God of Israel. 
The major sources on early Samaritans include Josephus, the New Testament, and Rabbinic Literature, although references to the Samaritans have also been suggested in works such as Ezra, Nehemiah, and Ben Sira. In addition to literary sources, much recent work in archaeology has provided further information about the ancient Samaritans.",-499,100,1138,824,Sara Boston,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-17 17:22:17.818 +0200,2020-08-28 12:52:45.250 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.27863233323612435,0.005275020851427381,0.5029461425362189,0.1982613294024745,0.014885173973754868,3.3962651472779948e-18
983,Tibetan and Himalayan Mundane and Landscape Cults,43,Religious Group (v6),"Across the large geographical space of the Tibetan Plateau and the Himalayas, cultures and societies of speakers of Tibetic languages share certain religious notions and similar ritual practices which do not derive from Buddhism or Yungdrung Bön (g.Yung drung Bon) but rather relate to local natural environments and social structures. Being very variable and difficult to subsume under one term, these localised religious cults have been called ‘popular’ (Bell 1931), ‘nameless’ (Stein 1972), ‘folk’ (Tucci 1980), often also ‘shamanism’ or ‘bön’ (bon), and in specific cases ‘pagan’ (Ramble 2008) and ‘mundane’. They are concerned with mundane aims of well-being and prosperity, fecundity and progeniture, health, protection and warfare, and general worldly success; not with soteriology. They most likely represent indigenous, pre-Buddhist cults of Tibet and the Himalayas.

Cosmologically, the world is threefold, composed from (1.) the upper heavenly sphere of deities (lha / lha); (2.) the middle earthly level inhabited by humans and other, including supernatural, beings (for ex. nyen / gnyan, tsen / btsan, dü / bdud, etc.), usually rendered into English as gods, deities, spirits, demons, etc.; and (3.) the lower chthonic realm of various other beings (widely called lu / klu). Humans in the intermediate level come into contact with beings, more or less powerful, benevolent or malicious, from all the three permeable spheres, and must develop methods of communication and coexistence with them in order to live and prosper. These typically consist of prescribed behavior and taboos, invocations, offerings and other ritual means, by which people acquire forces of good fortune, prosperity and fertility, and avoid possible punishments. These beings are often anthropomorphic and perceived to dwell in the sky (or elaborated atmospheric levels) or in physical structures, both natural and man-made: mountains, hills, rocks, boulders, water sources, plants; hearth, the main house pillar; and also in the human body. As they can be in fact omni-present, they often influence people’s lived daily realities and practices. Probably thousands of such deities exist, at times organised into hierarchised groups. 

Territorial deities, commonly called yüllha (yul lha, ‘god of a valley/region’), zhidak (gzhi bdag, ‘lord of a base/place/soil’), yüllha zhidak (yul lha gzhi bdag), or yülsa (yul sa, ‘lord of earth/place’), tend to be the most prominent, and among them mountain deities believed to inhabit mountain glaciers and peaks and govern their surroundings. Mountain deities, and certain deities of the celestial realm, are sometimes perceived as ancestors of descent lines and whole communities, usually tied to patrilines and one’s birth place. Mountains and their deities have become important symbols of regional and, especially since the mid-20th century, also Tibetan national identity, such as Mt Kailash, Gang Tisé (Gangs ti se) or Gang Rinpoche (Gangs rin po che) in Tibetan, in West Tibet, and Anyé Machen (A myes rma chen) in East Tibet. The paramount Mt Everest is also sacred and hosts goddess Jomo Langma (Jo mo glang ma). Almost all local cults have been historically exposed to Buddhist and Yungdrung Bön domination, and in most cases were to varying degrees incorporated into the two Doctrines. Vice versa, they have influenced all schools of Tibetan Buddhism, including Yungdrung Bön, by bringing strong local elements into even common monastic practice. Many local cults are very vulnerable also to current globalising and modernisation pressures.",600,2020,1107,736,Anna Sehnalova,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-21 16:23:57.765 +0200,2021-04-10 21:58:56.454 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),4.049076928654229e-24,0.9999921104348002,1.2018481101096045e-24,1.958790173353097e-24,7.88956519975022e-06,5.0984571453831385e-19
984,Calvinism (Early/Reformation),43,Religious Group (v6),"Calvinism, in its early stages, drew its character and theological emphases from the ministry and teaching of John Calvin. Born in France, Calvin moved to Geneva in 1534 and, after a brief exile (1538-41), he returned and was installed as the religious leader of the new republic. Calvin was influenced by other early Reformers—Martin Luther, Huylrich Zwingli, Philip Melancthon, and Heinrich Bullinger—and adopted the theological touchstones of the movement: scripture alone, faith alone, grace alone, Christ alone, and glory to God alone. While early Calvinism continued to affirm much of the Christian tradition, Calvin was instrumental in forming his own distinct form of Protestantism. Theologically, early Calvinism distinguished itself from Roman Catholicism in its understanding of the authority of scripture, the person and work of Jesus Christ (Christology), the emphasis on God’s election (predestination), the sacraments, and on the purpose and shape of the Christian life. In terms of the latter, Calvin uniquely combined the ecclesiastical structures of the church in Geneva with the local governing structures, effectively combining his theological commitments about the transformation of the human being by the grace of God in faith with their social and ethical expressions. His understanding of the way the Church could and should regulate the moral lives of citizens, as well as church members, was rooted in an expectation that this was how societies, nations, and eventually the world, would be transformed. While later Calvinism is associated with a number of different ecclesiastical forms and cannot be said to agree on any one set of theological doctrines, early Calvinism was very much tied to the person of John Calvin and the local way he applied his theology, ecclesiastically and politically, in Geneva. Where applicable, it will include the work of his contemporaries in the Reformation moments (i.e., Zwingli in Switzerland, Luther in Germany)",1520,1565,1139,828,Chelsea Williams,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-21 19:38:04.041 +0200,2020-09-08 17:28:45.287 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.11142904221384904,0.0002946150097132455,5.975075451822126e-22,0.884534430799012,0.0037419119774256488,6.956328946045256e-32
987,"Parsis, Zoroastrians of India",43,Religious Group (v6),"The Parsis (or Parsees) are an ethno-religious community traditionally based in western India, and professing the Zoroastrian religion. They are the descendants of the group of Zoroastrians who migrated to India after the Islamic conquest of Iran in the 7th century CE. The Parsis of India constitute the largest community of followers of Zoroastrianism in the world. Over the centuries, the Parsis have integrated into Indian society, while simultaneously maintaining their distinct religious customs and ethnic identity. The term Pārsi (meaning ‘Persian’ in the Persian language) is used as a descriptor of the community signifying their Iranian origin.
The early history of the Parsis in India is not known well, and mainly traced to a single source, the Qisse-ye Sanjān ‘The Story of Sanjān’ dated to 1600 CE. After initially settling in and around the town of Sanjān in South Gujarat on the west coast of India, they are supposed to have dispersed northwards to other towns in Gujarat, mainly Navsari, Ankleshwar, Bharuch and Khambat (Cambay).
However the period from the 17th century onward is relatively well recorded, and after the arrival of the British in India, the Parsis transformed from a predominantly rural agricultural community to one engaged in many services and industrial pursuits, especially in the cities of Surat and Bombay. The 18th and 19th centuries saw the community rapidly rising to prominence, and under British patronage, were pioneers in many fields including education and the arts. Many prominent families amassed large fortunes and the community became well-known for its munificent charities. In the 20th century, the Parsis dispersed across the Indian sub-continent as well as to other British colonies such as Aden and East African countries.
The Parsis today are a highly urbanised community with more than 95% of its members living in cities, chiefly Mumbai (formerly Bombay) which has been home to 70% of the Indian Parsis since the 1950s. The last fifty years have seen many Parsis, especially the youth, emigrating to other countries, mainly UK, USA and Canada, the Middle-east and more recently to Australia and New Zealand.  

Class: Among the Parsis, the priestly class (Athornans) is differentiated from the laity (Behdins), and the priesthood is hereditary. Only boys belonging to the priestly class are eligible to undergo the initiation ceremonies of priesthood. 
Language: Since the Parsis were based in the Indian state of Gujarat for much of their long history, their native language is Gujarati; however their dialect, Parsi Gujarati, is distinct from the standard Gujarati of the state. While almost all Parsis can converse in Gujarati, the youth especially in urban areas increasingly use English as their primary language for communication. The religious texts of the Parsis are mainly in Avestan, an Old Iranian language, and also in Pahlavi (Middle Persian). Though both these languages are not comprehended by a majority of the Parsis, all prayers are still recited in these languages as per tradition by both the priesthood and the laity.
Sects: The Parsis are differentiated from their fellow Zoroastrians who arrived from Iran to India in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and are known as the Iranis. The term Parsi-Irani is used as a designator for the entire Zoroastrian community of India, however the standalone term Parsis is also used interchangeably as an all-encompassing term. 
The community is also divided on the basis of a calendrical difference into two factions, the majority Shahenshahis (‘Royalists’) who continued to follow the existing calendar of the Indian Zoroastrians, and the minority Kadimis (‘Ancients’) who adopted the old calendar of the Iranian Zoroastrians, which runs one month ahead of the Shahenshahi calendar.",1600,2020,1145,831,Kerman Daruwalla,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-25 21:19:36.333 +0200,2020-09-13 00:58:20.758 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.653804317173277,0.005879222739348586,1.9544758787771103e-11,0.3319474310838144,0.008369028984015354,7.104010635961868e-20
988,Churches of Christ- United States,43,Religious Group (v6),"Churches of Christ in North America are a collection of autonomous Christian congregations that have their origins in the ""Restoration Movement"" within American Christianity that occurred in the 1800's. Located primarily in the American south, Churches of Christ emerged in the first major division of the Stone-Campbell Movement at the end of the nineteenth century. This separation was made complete in 1906, when the United States Bureau of the Census distinguished Churches of Christ as a separate and distinct religious group. There are currently more than 13,000 individual congregations within the United States with an average membership of 100 people. Of those 13,000 congregations, 1,240 of them have a predominately African American membership (approximately 172,000 members). Churches of Christ also has an additional 240 congregations that are independent Spanish-speaking churches, most of which are located in Texas, California, and Puerto Rico.

The majority of members of Churches of Christ in the United States live in the central and southern regions of the country. While there are Church of Christ congregations in every state, they are most heavily concentrated in the American south, from Texas to North Carolina. More than 28 percent of members of Churches of Christ live in either Texas or Tennessee. Churches of Christ began from a motivation not to start a new form of Christianity, but to serve as a unifying movement that sought to bring together previously divided Christians through an appeal to the pattern of Christianity as interpreted in the New Testament. 

Following from this appeal to a return to the form of Christianity present within the New Testament, Churches of Christ have rejected any formal organizational structures, choosing instead to have the local congregation serve as its own governing authority. This has also meant that Churches of Christ have no official journals or other processes by which to declare sanctioned positions. Because of the independent nature of Churches of Christ, commonalities across the tradition depend more on a specific set of practices and interpretive strategies than declared theological convictions or beliefs.

While changing within some parts of the tradition, Churches of Christ is most well-known for its practice of acapella singing. Yet there are other distinctive features that have marked this denomination as a distinctive group among other Christian traditions. First among these distinctive features is the hermeneutical approach that has been at the core of Church of Christ identity and practice since its inception. This interpretive approach rests on a three-fold pattern that reads Scripture and shapes its communal and individual practice by finding in Scripture a direct command, an example to imitate, or by making a necessary inference when commands or examples are not present. This interpretive approach has been highly influential within Churches of Christ, and is the source of many contemporary debates and the appropriate response. Second, Churches of Christ are defined by a strong commitment to notions of the priesthood of all believers, and therefore eschew any distinction between a “religious” and “non-religious” class. There is no ordination process within Churches of Christ. And while religious training (either through a theological school or some other form) is viewed as a positive thing, none is required to serve in a ministerial role within the tradition. Rather, worship and communal life within Churches of Christ is dependent upon a high level of involvement by the members of each congregation. Finally, Churches of Christ have, historically, possessed a high level of exclusivism in its understanding of its religious identity. While this characteristic has come under fire and is changing within many parts of the tradition, it has been a defining feature for much of the tradition’s history.

As it moves into the 21st century, Churches of Christ are currently facing a number of questions and challenges, ranging from questions of gender and sexuality inclusion, to the trends of religious decline that are effecting all religious traditions within the United States.",1832,2020,1146,821,Mason Lee,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-28 16:18:01.121 +0200,2020-09-21 13:44:34.410 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),2.3985385140594873e-13,1.8922628606914005e-17,3.968671933052694e-56,6.696881732008927e-13,0.9999999999990905,2.926829643195171e-26
989,Opus Dei,43,Religious Group (v6),"Opus Dei (“Work of God” in Latin), also known as the Prelature of the Holy Cross, is a modern international institution within the Roman Catholic Church. Opus Dei was founded by Josemaria Escriva (1902-1975), a Spanish priest who was canonized as a saint by the Catholic Church in 2002.  According to Escriva, after years of waiting to learn how God wanted Escriva to uniquely serve him, Escriva received a divine inspiration on October 2, 1928 to found a new path within the Catholic Church by which all men and women could hear and follow the universal call to holiness. The universal call to holiness refers to the belief that God desires all human beings to be saints. Escriva founded Opus Dei specifically to help Catholic lay people (i.e. non priests, monks, and nuns) become saints through their professional work. He writes that “the sole objective of Opus Dei has always been to see to it that there be men and women of all races and social conditions who endeavor to love and to serve God and the rest of mankind in and through their ordinary work, in the midst of the realities and interests of the world” (Josemaria Escriva, Conversations, no. 10).  There are currently about 90,000 members of Opus Dei of every racial, social, and secular condition in more than 90 countries. Opus Dei is not a religious order of the Catholic church. Members of Opus Dei do not take religious vows or distinguish themselves from their fellow citizens, and they live and work in the world just as they did before they joined Opus Dei.  Members are united by the ideal of following Christ and totally giving themselves to God as ordinary citizens and family members, and thus being Christian contemplatives in the middle of the world. Escriva chose St. Joseph, husband of the Virgin Mary, as the patron or special protector of Opus Dei, since St. Joseph lived an integrated life of prayer, ordinary work, and familial and social relationships. According to Escriva, the foundation of Opus Dei’s spirituality is an awareness of every human being’s divine filiation, or status as a child of God.  Members of Opus Dei are supposed to practice and share confidence in divine providence, simplicity in dialogue with God, fraternity among all people, respect for human dignity, a love for the world and all realities created by God, and a spirit of peace and cheerful hope. Other key features of Opus Dei’s spirituality are the importance of prayer and sacrifice, the value of personal freedom, charity towards others, and unity of life (i.e. the integration of one’s interior and religious life with one’s professional, social, and family life). Opus Dei has existed as an institution since 1928, but it was erected as a personal prelature of the Church in 1982 by a pontifical act. According to the formal document composed by the Sacred Congregation for Bishops and approved by Pope John Paul II, the Prelature of the Holy Cross “is directly aimed at promoting the apostolic activity of the Church, inasmuch as it puts into operation a new pastoral instrument, which up to now was only foreseen and desired in the law of the Church, and it does so through an institution which offers proven guarantees of apostolic vigor, discipline and faithfulness to the teaching of the Church” (“Vatican Declaration concerning Opus Dei,” 1982). Opus Dei is governed by the prelate of Opus Dei and his councils, who reside in Rome. The clergy of Opus Dei are drawn from the lay members of Opus Dei. The lay members of Opus Dei have the same freedom to make decisions in personal, professional, social, economic and political matters as other Catholics. They are under the jurisdiction of the prelate only “in regard to what has to do with the fulfillment of the specific ascetic formative and apostolic commitments which they have freely undertaken by means of the contractual bond dedicating them to the service of the aims of the Prelature” (“Vatican Declaration Concerning Opus Dei,” IIId).  The lay members of Opus Dei are under the jurisdiction of their diocesan bishop in all that the law lays down for the ordinary faithful.",1928,2020,1147,765,Margaret Freddoso,49,Ian Randall,2020-08-29 20:29:46.165 +0200,2023-04-25 16:33:24.908 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.13864845278925828,0.001429916198203052,0.4202443597631511,0.4396546589561128,2.2612293274833227e-05,1.6801323859728744e-33
993,Pontifex Maximus and Pontifices (Pontifical College),43,Religious Group (v6),"Perhaps, no other religious title and college has as long a tenure as the Pontifex Maximus and the Pontifical College, whose origins lay in the mythical foundations of Rome and continue today, albeit organizationally, religiously, and semantically different, in the Vatican within the Roman Catholic Church. The Pontifex Maximus and the Pontifical College has a debated origin. On the one hand, some scholars such Denova continue the traditional line that “Pontifex” means “the bridge builder” between man and the gods, and that the Pontifices were associated with the early river worship of the Tiberinus, and later Jupiter Optimus Maximus. Others such as Ribezzo and Kavanagh have argued that Pontifex comes from Sabine (Italic Oscan) and the word means “college of five” (ponti < puntes “five” and fex < trefex “college”). 
Nevertheless, what is generally agreed upon is that the Pontifices served as advisors to the king of monarchical Rome. In Roman legends and ancient Roman historiography, King Numa (according to Livy) was one of the first Pontifex Maximus who established the organizational bureaucracy of the Roman state religion, the Vestal Virgins, and the appointment of other Pontifices. Whatever the reality of the situation was during the regal period of Rome, by the Middle of the Roman Republic, the Pontifices and their college began to have power over other priesthoods of Rome: the rex sacrorum, Vestal Virgins, the other flamines of other gods, the augurs, and, finally, the haruspices. Furthermore, the Pontifical College was in charge of the following activities: record keeping (annals, commentaries, etc.), the correct form of ritual and prayers, the Roman Calendar (“fasti”), family law – patrician marriage, adoption, and the transference of dead bodies to other burial sites. Because the Pontifices were at the top of the Roman civic cult, additionally, they approved whether or not a new god could enter the Roman Pantheon (cases abound, such as Magna Mater and Quintus Metellus building a shrine to Isis -see the entry on Cult of Isis). 
To highlight their importance, the offices of the Pontifical College were located in Regia and the living quarters of the Pontifex Maximus was in the domus publica, both of which are situated in the Roman forum – the civic center of Rome. Additionally, the Pontifical College was originally only reserved to the patrician class during the Early and Middle Republic, but by 300 BC, under the lex Ogulnia, the Pontifical College was open to the plebeians and the number of pontiffs increased to nine (Rüpke). Furthermore, the Pontifex Maximus was subject to direct election of a selected number of Roman tribes (seventeen out of the thirty-five selected by lot - Rüpke), and remained an appointment for life. The first plebeian Pontifex Maximus was, perhaps, Tiberius Coruncanius elected in 254 BC by the comitia and first published public consultations (Cornu-Thénard).
One last bureaucratic feature of the Pontifical Colleges was that Pontiffs could also become secular, legal magistrates and hold political office. Cases abound, and famous examples are the jurist Scaevola and Julius Caesar. Nevertheless, the Pontiffs were prohibited from holding other priesthoods, except for rare occasions (see Szelmer). Because a person could be both a pontiff and magistrate, it is quite clear that under the Roman Republic that the Pontifical College and the Senate worked closely in tandem. The Senate consulted the Pontifical College on omens, prodigies, and on what days could public and state business be held. At times, the position of pontiff could be used as political leverage, such as Julius Caesar who was elected as Pontifex before holding a single political office (Ross Taylor).
Over time, however, the power of the Pontifical College and the Pontifex Maximus was diminished and became increasing subject to the violent political forces of the Late Republic. The dictator Sulla removed the Lex Domitia – the direct election of pontiffs by the comitia of the Roman people – and placed the election at the hands of the Pontifical College. This was undone later by the Lex Labiena, though Lily Ross finds that there was no change under Sulla and that Caesar solely supported the Lex Labiena to gain popular favor. Another restriction to the Pontificate was the Lex Papia that prohibited the Pontifical College from directly selecting a Vestal Virgin: instead, the Pontifex Maximus recommended names to be selected by lot at a public Roman contio (Mekacher and Van Haeperen).
At last, with the dictatorship of Julius Caesar, the ensuing civil wars, and Augustus’ election in 12 BC as Pontifex Maximus (Cameron), did the unification of the Pontifex Maximus and secular power occur. As Emperor, Augustus expanded the power of the Pontifex Maximus over all religious colleges that were not subject to the purview of the Pontifical College (such as mystery cults) (Cameron), and enshrined the power of both Emperor and Pontifex Maximus in the Imperial cult. The Emperor as Pontifex Maximus continued long into 4th and 5th century, despite the advent of Christianity and the Christian appropriation of pontifices to name their bishops. Cameron points out that the bishop of Rome in the AD 360s was pontifex summus, and not maximus. Furthermore, Christian emperors did not shy away from the title of Pontifex Maximus, until, perhaps, the Emperor Gratian in AD 382, where inscriptions begin to state imperial nomenclature not as Pontifex Maximus, but as Pontifex Inclitus (Cameron). Whatever the case may be, the situation of Late Antiquity demonstrates the process in which Church hierarchy begins to shed off the influence of imperial power that will culminate in the investiture conflicts of the Middle Ages (Concordat of Worms) and the Renaissance.",-712,380,872,733,Juan Dopico,18,Robyn Walsh,2020-09-06 03:09:34.526 +0200,2020-09-16 00:46:38.720 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),2.059815588612332e-23,0.9999945867772739,1.6031579570100543e-23,4.38356370281326e-23,5.413222726043076e-06,1.523518547599559e-19
994,"Monastic Communities of Lower Egypt: Nitria, Kellia, Scetis",43,Religious Group (v6),"Ascetic practices had been rich and varied from the beginning of Christian history.  In the first few centuries CE, precedents were established for some of the ascetic practices and goals monasticism became known for, such as the existence of communities of ascetic practioners living according to common spiritual goals, and the movement from populated centers to the outskirts, for reasons that included (but were not limited to) seeking peaceful environments for spiritual contemplation.  Christianity became officially recognized as a legal religion under Constantine in the early fourth century, and this policy change allowed the freedom for new modes of Christian practice and social organization.

In late third- and early fourth-century Egypt, new forms of Christian ascetic practice arose in the forms of eremitic, semi-eremetic, and cenobitic monasticism.  Eremitic monasticism, engagement in a solitary lifestyle devoted to spiritual pursuits apart from society, gained notoriety with the wide circulation of the Life of Antony by Athanasius, the archbishop of Alexandria.  Over time, influenced by reports of Antony, who lived alone for years in increasingly remote and challenging locations, battling demons and attaining a rare level of spiritual transformation, thousands of people, following his example, moved into the desert.  The three areas described in this entry were major centers for this new semi-eremitic monastic way of life.  (Compare these forms of monasticism with cenobitic monasticism, a more fully communal lifestyle, as represented by Pachomian monasticism, which is described in detail in a separate DRH entry.)

Amoun is credited for founding Nitria, about forty miles southeast of Alexandria (near modern al-Barnuji).  This site grew quickly to include not only monks seeking a spiritual life removed from society, but additionally, supportive visitors and other travelers who would stay in the area, with the result that over time, a tourist industry of sorts sprang up in the area.  This influx of visitors encroached on the monastic goal of a lifestyle of peaceful meditation, and some monks decided to move farther into the desert, into the area of Kellia (which means “the cells”).  A story is told about Amoun and Antony determining the location of the new site within a day’s walk of Nitria (about twelve miles away), far enough to achieve the remoteness desired, but close enough to facilitate visiting between the two communities (APalph Antony 34).  South of Nitria and Kellia is the area of Scetis, founded around 330 by Macarius of Egypt (so-called to distinguish him from Macarius of Alexandria) around a series of saline lakes (modern Wadi el Natrun).  All three locations are associated with niter/natron, a salt compound used in embalming, cleaning, and Egyptian faience.  These communities thrived and achieved wide renown as tales of their practices and inhabitants spread and inspired others across the Roman Empire during the fourth and fifth centuries.  Beginning in the early fifth century, a series of raids by desert nomads caused destruction to these communities, and initiated a slow decline.  Nitria was abandoned by the seventh century, and Kellia by the ninth.  Monastic activity waxed and waned over time in Scetis, with monastic activity still there in the present day.  The date range I cite for this entry (330-470 CE) is based on the estimated chronological limits for the primary evidence I am drawing from in answering the questions below.

The Apophthegmata Patrum (Sayings of the Fathers) preserves collections of sayings across multiple versions (notably the Alphabetical Collection [APalph], arranged by the name of the speaker named, the Systematic Collection [APsys], arranged roughly by topic, and the Anonymous Collection [APanon]), and in several languages.  (Note that because of this complicated source set, my AP citations below correspond to the numbering of commonly available English translations instead of critical editions, with the intention that a wider and more general readership can more easily track these down if interested.)  The sayings tend to follow the pattern of wisdom literature: short and pithy sayings intended to teach a moral lesson. Many come as responses to requests such as, “Abba, give me a word,” and “Abba, how can I be saved?”  Some are short dialogical narratives, often between a younger monk and a more experienced monk.  The majority (but not all) of these sayings are associated with residents of Nitria, Kellia, and Scetis, the last with the highest proportional representation.  These sayings were passed down and circulated through oral tradition and finally recorded probably in the late fifth century in Palestine.

In this entry, I am going to use the shorthand description “Nitrian Desert communities” to refer to Nitria, Kellia (with Pherme), and Scetis instead of listing them individually when I mean to refer to all of them.  This is not to say that there were not significant differences among people, practices, and social norms in these distinct areas; in fact, there were.  But rather, these can be grouped together meaningfully under one heading for two main reasons: 1) There is a recognizable monastic culture that is shared among these areas, partially because of the close social ties and visiting practices among them that fostered a coherent cultural and even social unity despite their geographical spread, and 2) the Apophthegmata Patrum, the largest single source (or more accurately, set of sources) of information about these communities, draws from their combined cultural group as a meaningful unit.",330,470,1150,818,Tola Rodrick,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-09-08 16:58:32.904 +0200,2020-09-24 00:07:04.925 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.13864845278925828,0.001429916198203052,0.4202443597631511,0.4396546589561128,2.2612293274833227e-05,1.6801323859728744e-33
995,Tamil Neo-Saivism,43,Religious Group (v6),"Generally understood to emerge with the teachings of the Tamil Sri Lankan religious scholar Arumuga Navalar (1822-1879), Tamil neo-Saivism is a discrete, reformist strain of Saiva Siddhanta Hinduism that has had wide-reaching influence on Tamil Hindu religious life and modern Tamil cultural thought in the Tamil cultural regions of South India and northern Sri Lanka (i.e., Tamil Elam). Some key features of Tamil neo-Saiva thought and practice include a frequent theological and scholastic focus on autonomous, ""Dravidian"" Tamil cultural identity and history relative to Brahmanical, Sanskritic, ""Aryan"" Hinduism; an explicitly monotheistic theology centered on the Hindu god Siva (Tamil civaṉ, Sanskrit Śiva; spelled Siva in this entry in deference to English-language neo-Saiva spelling conventions); and a particular connection with the Vellala caste community, a non-Brahmin Tamil caste community especially culturally influential and prestigious in pre-colonial Tamil society. Key to the intellectual development of neo-Saivism was the efflorescence of Tamil literary and historical scholarship associated with the Tamil Renaissance of the closing decades of the 19th century. Vellala Neo-Saiva scholars were at the forefront of historical scholarship that sought to investigate the culture, history, and social norms of an indigenous, pre-Sanskritic Tamil civilization, and the ""rediscovery"" of a wide range of ancient Tamil literature in the latter half of the 19th century offered a rich body of evidence for both theological and scholastic arguments about Tamil cultural identity. In opposition to the Sanskritic Brahmanical Hindu tradition, which attained an unprecedented degree of political and social influence in the Tamil country under British colonial rule, Tamil neo-Saivism eschews Sanskrit-language religious literature and Vedantic theology, instead recognizing a canon of Tamil-language texts and hymns including classical Tamil poetic literature from the Sangam period, the Saivite Tamil bhakti poetry of the Nāyaṉār poet-saints (6th-8th CE), and a variety of Tamil-language tantric and agamic texts with ties to non-Brahmin Tamil temple worship practices. Reversing the claims of Brahmanical Hinduism, Tamil neo-Saivism asserts that the worship of Siva is native to pre-Sanskritic Tamil civilization, and the Brahmanical tradition is a subsequent corruption of originally Tamil religious teachings. A resulting priority in neo-Saiva theology and scholarship is the re-establishment of putatively original Tamil religious, social, and cultural mores, a project through which religious ideas became linked to a distinct cultural politics. Notable Tamil neo-Saiva luminaries include Somasundara Nayakar (1846-1901), P. Sundaram Pillai (1855-1897), Maraimalai Adigal (1876-1950), and Neelambikai Ammaiyar (1903-1945).",1841,2020,1151,822,Collin Sibley,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-09-10 01:16:50.444 +0200,2020-09-23 08:51:49.275 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),2.491437867375921e-23,1.672521901748306e-37,1.369103701622127e-66,9.1705330356646e-33,0.9999999999999997,3.57532216329672e-16

This covers the cultural period of Naqada IIIc-d, and approximately 2950BCE-2670BCE (though these exact dates are debated). During this period, Egypt was politically united, and we therefore have a true Egyptian state. Throughout the history of ancient Egypt, the concept of religion does not seem to have been debated. The gods were an assumed part of life, and individuals were expected to make offerings to the gods and participate in religious festivals. In this way, the entire population can be considered part of the religious group. Much of the iconography and burial practices from the previous Predynastic Period continued into the Early Dynastic, though there were a number of additional advances.

1024,Universal Salvation Ritual,43,Religious Group (v6),"Throughout pre-modern Chinese history, dynastic transitions accompanied by constant turmoil destabilized not only the social system but also social mentality. Wars, famine, and pestilence swept over the entire empire and left fields littered with corpses. The unpredictability of one’s fate was further aggravated by increasing concern about the unstable boundaries between this world and the other worlds, thus opening up the society to the possibility of ritual manipulation. Aiming at bringing about the deliverance en masse of the souls of the dead and conferring blessings upon the living regardless of age, gender, or social status, universal salvation rituals provided effective remedies for helping the souls of the dead to gain relief from the fate of postmortem punishment and restore tranquility to the living. The idea of “universal salvation” has long been a Mahāyānist Buddhist goal since early on in Chinese history. But it was during the late tenth century through the thirteenth century that it became prominent in both Buddhist and Daoist postmortem ritual services, such as in the Buddhist Water-Land Retreat (Shuilu zhai 水陸齋) and the Daoist Yellow Register Retreat (Huanglu zhai 黃籙齋) in particular. Still practiced nationwide in contemporary China as well as in some diasporic Chinese communities, both rituals had their origins in the tenth century, but their textual elaboration and social spread was a product of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Most contemporary performances of the Water-Land Retreat in mainland China and diaspora Chinese communities use a four-fascicle manual entitled Shuilu yigui huiben水陸儀軌會本 (Synthetic Manual of Water-Land Rite) which is based on a six-fascicle manual entitled Fajie shengfan shuilu shenghui xiuzhai yigui法界圣凡水陸勝會修齋儀軌 (Ritual Manual for Performing the Retreat of the Grand Assembly of All Saintly and Mundane Beings of Water and Land) compiled by the Ming Buddhist master Zhuhong’s祩宏 (1535-1615). But there is another Water-Land ritual tradition based on a ritual manual called Tiandi mingyang shuilu yiwen天地冥陽水陸儀文 (TDMY). The extant recension of the TDMY manual seems to have been compiled in Shanxi province山西 during the early decades of the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) by a Buddhist monk named Yijin 義金 (act. ca. 1368-1424), who most likely based his manual on an earlier text that postdated the Northern Song dynasty and found great popularity under the Jurchen Jin (1115-1234).
The Daoist Yellow Register Retreat was primarily based on the Numinous Treasure (Lingbao靈寶) scriptural and liturgical traditions but had also absorbed elements of other contemporary Daoist movements such as the Divine Empyrean (Shenxiao神霄) and Celestial Heart (Tianxin天心) movements. The name of “Yellow Register Retreat” first appeared in one of the “Old Lingbao scriptures” (gu lingbaojing古靈寶經) called Taishang dongxuan lingbao huanglu jianwen sanyuan weiyi ziran zhenjing太上洞玄靈寶黃籙簡文三元威儀自然真經and later in Lu Xiujing’s 陸修靜 (406-477) Five Sentiments [of Gratitude] (Taishang lingbao wugan wen 太上靈寶五感文), where it is listed as one of the various Methods of Retreats (zhong zhaifa衆齋法) and second only to the Golden Register Retreat (Jinlu zhai金籙齋). Mainly composed of confessions made to the twenty directions, the principal function of the Yellow Register Retreat at that time was to uproot the sins and transgressions of ancestors of up to nine generations (ba jiuzu zuigen 拔九祖罪根). However, its full maturation as an independent liturgy was not to take shape until Du Guangting 杜光庭 (850-933) compiled the Liturgical Manual for the Yellow Register Retreat (Taishang Huanglu zhaiyi太上黃籙齋儀), which can be considered the culmination of medieval Daoist rituals for the dead. After that, the Yellow Register Retreat became a systematically organized and widely practiced liturgy that accommodated a great variety of needs, including state peace and prosperity, repose for the dead, salvation of restless spirits, exorcism of ghosts and demons, and so on. Throughout later generations, this manual became an authoritative source for the practice of Yellow Register Retreat and served as a model through the following three centuries.",1200,1920,1170,873,Jingyu Liu,51,Michael Naparstek,2021-01-11 20:34:46.053 +0100,2021-04-22 17:40:10.989 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.15710786921354672,0.0030915378997239127,0.7010961093281399,0.13773348629250143,0.0009709972660879912,1.250484642481105e-31
1028,German Pietists (Hasidei Ashkenaz),43,Religious Group (v6),"The German Pietists (Hasidei Ashkenaz in Hebrew) were a group of Jews who lived along the Rhineland in the towns of Speyer, Regensburg, Worms, and Mainz in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The German Pietists advocated strict observance of Jewish law and, subsequently, tended to avoided Jews whom they believed did not follow these precepts strictly enough. Members from this community produced religious works, including a compendium entitled Sefer Hasidim (The Book of the Pietists) that contains legal and social advice, often in the form of exempla, for its adherents. Despite stemming from a somewhat isolated group, Sefer Hasidim reveals much about the daily life of Ashkenazi Jewry, with its advice revealing economic, mystical, social, pious, and cultural concerns. The group’s foremost rabbi was Rabbi Judah ben Samuel of Regensburg, or Judah he-Hasid (Judah the Pious), who died in 1217, and to whom Sefer Hasidim is attributed. His followers included Rabbi Eleazer ha-Rokeah (“the Perfumer”) of Worms, who wrote an elegy for his murdered wife Dulce. This elegy has tremendous historical value for understanding the status of women in Jewish communities of Germany. The last active members of this group died by the middle of the thirteenth century.

1037,Third Intermediate Period in Ancient Egypt,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Third Intermediate Period is that represented by the 21st to 25th Dynasties of Egyptian history. It was a period of political disunity, when Egyptian territory was controlled by two or more contemporaneous lines of rulers, whose spheres of influence shifted over time. Some of these rulers held the status of kings, while others based their authority on their control of non-indigenous groups (Libyans and Kushites), armed forces and high religious office. For much of the period Egypt's political influence abroad was relatively weak, and the internal economy of the divided land was not conducive to the construction of elaborate monuments on the scale of those of the preceding New Kingdom. The evidence for religious attitudes indicates that there was continuity from preceding periods, and geographical consistency, with the same beliefs and practices being held by indigenous inhabitants and also by members of Libyan and Kushite groups dwelling within Egypt's borders. The Kushites also adopted Egyptian religious practices in their homeland (modern Sudan). Detailed textual sources for this period are scarce, monuments such as temples (or elements of temples) few and insignificant, and grave goods restricted in type and quantity.

1038,Sino-Muslims in Qing China,43,Religious Group (v6),"Sino-Muslims in Qing China refers to Chinese-speaking Muslims who were natives in China proper and regular subjects of the Qing state. Their history can be traced back to the Tang dynasty (618-907) when Arabic and Persian merchants began to sojourn in China’s southeastern coastal area for trade. Many stayed and became Chinese subjects. After the Mongol invasion, large numbers of Middle Eastern and Central Asian Muslims further entered China proper during the Yuan period (1271-1368) through military campaigns and commercial activities. By the Qing (1644-1911), after several hundred years of reproduction, intermarriage, adoption, conversion (very limited), and internal migration, Muslims in China proper were already widely dispersed in villages and towns, in counties, prefectures, and provinces throughout the territory. In 1910, they had an estimated population of four to seven million.
Dwelling together with their non-Muslim (mostly Han Chinese) neighbors for long, these Muslims spoke Chinese, pursued Confucian social values, and embraced local customs practiced by Han Chinese. The Qing state found it too difficult to grant them with territory-based legal autonomy like what they did to Turkic Muslims and other ethnic minorities in borderlands. They were also not recognized by the state as a distinct category of imperial subjects, and were classified sometimes into the Han Chinese majority, and sometimes into Turkic Muslims. In occasions needing differentiation, the state might vaguely call them neidi huimin内地回民 (Muslim subjects in China proper) or hanhui汉回 (Han Chinese Muslims). For convenience of analysis, contemporary scholars refer to them as “Sino-Muslims.”
Despite their acculturation and their murky visibility in the state, Sino-Muslims in Qing China did not forsake or conceal their Islamic distinction in daily practices. They built mosques and Islamic schools throughout China proper. They travelled around in China proper and formed various types of transregional networks with co-religionists. They also widely published and disseminated Islamic scriptures and books written in the Chinese language. By the early 19th century, dispersed Sino-Muslims had been sharing common memory, knowledge, and discourse, etc. which contributed to a sense of collectivity rising among them, transcending regional differences within China proper. It distinguished them not just from non-Muslims in China proper, but more substantially from Muslims outside China proper. In terms of religious affiliation, most Sino-Muslims in Qing China belonged to Gedimu (the traditional Hanafi school of Sunni Islam in China). A small number of them (primarily in the northwest) began to be converted to Sufi sects since the early Qing period when Sufism was coming into China.",1644,1911,1183,876,Shaodan Zhang,45,Matthew Hamm,2021-02-02 19:39:16.803 +0100,2021-09-28 02:31:27.427 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.10289570404474999,0.0027358469064437934,0.7991461272260284,0.09521348226147294,8.839561304797324e-06,2.7515748570704356e-34
1041,Korean Catholicism,43,Religious Group (v6),"Catholicism first entered Joseon Korea in the early seventeenth century through books written by Western missionaries and their Chinese colleagues brought back by Koreans who had traveled to Beijing as part of government tribute missions. While some Korean scholars were interested in the science and technology contained in those books, they rejected the religion. However, in the latter part of the eighteenth century some reform-oriented scholars who questioned traditional Neo-Confucianism began to take Catholicism more seriously, leading to the baptism of one of their number, Peter Yi Seunghun, in 1784. He would return to Korea and begin to baptize others, so that when the first priest (a native of China) entered the country in 1794, there were already several thousand Catholics, including members of all ranks of society. Though these first Korean Catholics were heavily influenced by Confucianism, for instance, hoping that God’s grace would help them become more filial children, the Catholic rejection of ancestor rites and challenging of traditional class and gender hierarchy with notions of spiritual equality, as well as their connection with foreigners, would lead to massive state-sponsored persecutions that would kill thousands between the late eighteen and nineteenth centuries. Though the opening of Korea in the last quarter of the nineteenth century led to the petering out of anti-Catholic violence, the Korean Catholic community would remain on the margins of society (and would face nearly complete destruction in the north following national division) until beginning around the 1960s when growth in the number of laity, nuns, monks, and priests; reforms from the Second Vatican Council that allowed the use of the vernacular language and other similar changes; increased educational and medical work; and highly visible participation in the democratization movements, led to a high level of familiarity and respect among non-Catholic Koreans. For instance, Cardinal Stephen Kim Suhwan would publicly challenge the dictator Park Chunghee for his violation of human rights and Thomas More Kim Dae Jung in 1996 was a key leader in the democratization movement and his election to the presidency marked the triumph of democracy in the Republic of Korea as it involved the peaceful transfer of authority between a party in power and one that had been out of power. While Catholicism has sufficient numbers and respect to make it highly visible in Korea, like other religions it is being impacted by demographic decline. Moreover, while considered progressive on issues of democratization, as issues of sexual morality are increasingly becoming objects of debate in Korea, the traditionalist stance of the Catholic Church might lead it to have more conflict with society. As in other parts of the world, Catholic devotional life focuses on such practices as attendance at Mass, reception of the sacraments, and recitation of the rosary. Notable characteristics include the comparatively larger choirs in parish churches (Korean Catholics tend to be excellent and exuberant singers), the importance of domestic pilgrimage (made possible by the large number of holy sites created by persecution), interest in saints (again, a product of persecution), and the dignified solemnity of liturgical practices (which are in part an inheritance from Confucianism).",1600,2021,1188,886,Franklin Rausch,45,Matthew Hamm,2021-02-12 19:50:31.710 +0100,2021-02-22 14:46:53.898 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.13864845278925828,0.001429916198203052,0.4202443597631511,0.4396546589561128,2.2612293274833227e-05,1.6801323859728744e-33
1043,Islam in Aceh,43,Religious Group (v6),"Aceh enjoys a reputation as Indonesia’s “Verandah of Mecca,” a place of special piety and devotion to Sunni Islam.  With the confirmed presence of Muslims in the region by the 13th century, Aceh gave rise to one of the oldest Islamic kingdoms in Southeast Asia and emerged by the 1600s as a center of Muslim scholarship during the reign of Sultan Iskandar Muda and several female “sultanah” successors.  After the Dutch colonial invasion of the sultanate, Acehnese Muslims leapt to the forefront of religiously inspired resistance against colonialism during the long Dutch-Aceh War (1873-1914), established vibrant Islamic schools during the 20th century, and claimed “special autonomy” status in matters of religious administration in the aftermath of their incorporation into the newly independent Indonesian nation-state in 1945.  Since the end of Suharto’s “New Order” regime in 1998, Aceh continues to forge ahead with the implementation of a distinctive Islamic legal and bureaucratic system (Syariat Islam) as part of its special autonomy status. Within this general framework of Sunni Islamic piety, Acehnese Muslims have embraced varied religious practices, textual traditions, political affiliations and approaches to the interpretation of Islamic law.

1044,Han Imperial Cult under Emperor Wu,43,Religious Group (v6),"During the reign of Han Emperor Wu (141 – 87 BCE), the imperial government sponsored the worship of a large number of cults, many of which were connected to the emperor’s pursuit of immortality. Many of these cults were inherited from earlier, Qin, practice, others were adopted from regional cults of the former Warring States, and others were entirely new. Rather than being a formalized group of religious specialists/practitioners, Emperor Wu’s imperial cult, meaning cults sponsored by the emperor, is better understood as a collection of religious practices, which were brought together under the auspices of the Han court, in order to access powerful spirits for both the emperor and his empire. The cults worshipped by the emperor, or on his behalf, were spread out across the empire, and the emperor frequently travelled to perform sacrifices or visit sacred locations.
The number of cults grew over the course of Emperor Wu’s reign, and there were frequent changes to sacrificial locations and sacrificial rites. This period of imperial cult is thus characterized by experimentation rather than as a coherent cult with a standardized pantheon.
Emperor Wu’s pursuit of cult was closely connected to his pursuit of immortality as well as to his imperial ambitions – the two cannot be separated. We cannot say for certain what type of immortality the emperor pursued, whether it was the avoidance of death altogether or transcendence, or some combination of the two. It is evident that the emperor believed that one of the clearest paths to immortality could be found by emulating the sage rulers of antiquity, particularly the legendary Yellow Thearch 黃帝, Yao 堯, Shun 舜, and Yu 禹, as well as following precedent set by the First Emperor of Qin.  Significantly, the emperor believed that it was important for him to rule over a unified territory in order to perform the legendary Feng 封 and Shan 禪 sacrifices, which he was told, were performed by the Yellow Thearch before he became an immortal. As such, the emperor took over control of territory containing important cult locations, removing regional lords 諸侯 and kings 王 from governing over territories containing the Five Sacred Peaks 五嶽. The emperor also attempted to access the powers of local spirits, mostly in the eastern parts of the empire, to not only access their mantic powers, but to demonstrate his authority over the spirits and land of the empire. Emperor Wu sought the advice on spiritual affairs from both within his own court and by recruiting outsiders who claimed access to mantic knowledge. These outsiders, whom Sima Qian classifies as Fangshi 方士 (Masters of Methods), claimed to have specialized knowledge about immortality. Sima Qian, and others, were highly critical of the emperor’s reliance on these Fangshi, and many of the cults that they established were disbanded after the emperor’s death.
We have no information about the practice of these cults when the emperor was not involved, nor if they continued in some form after the period of imperial patronage.",-141,-87,89,870,Rebecca Robinson,45,Matthew Hamm,2021-02-16 03:34:51.195 +0100,2022-01-26 22:15:23.022 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),3.1732012756179757e-59,9.929374212899525e-48,2.0232872640928378e-148,3.4146227319397666e-121,9.235549753061982e-19,1.0

Over several centuries the demographics of this town changed considerably from an initial Egyptian planned settlement to a town inhabited mostly by the people of local and foreign Levantine origin. Eventually, the Egyptian government of the late Middle Kingdom lost control of its border provinces and a new state was formed in the Eastern Delta with Tell el-Dab'a (ancient Avaris) as its capital. The new rulers of the region belonged to an elite class known as the Hyksos. These men of foreign origin, judging by the names of most but certainly not all of them, ruled by taking over much of ancient Egyptian kingship ideology, titles and iconography.

1071,Digital Shinto Communities,43,Religious Group (v6),"Digital Shinto communities (DSCs) are transnational networks of Shinto shrines, priests, and lay practitioners supported by various forms of digital technology, in particular social media platforms. These communities center on the ritual veneration of immanent Shinto deities known as kami (神), as ""Shintō"" (神道) is often translated as ""the Way of the Kami."" The category of kami is quite broad, including: divine personalities such Amaterasu Omikami,  sun goddess and imperial ancestress, or Inari Okami, particularly revered for agriculture, business, and prosperity broadly conceived; impersonal natural forces or features such as wind, thunder, trees, rivers, and mountains; and human figures. Generally speaking, during Shinto ritual veneration, extensions of a kami's spirit may be called to reside in certain natural and man-made materials (such as a sacred evergreen branch, a mirror, sword, paper or wooden talisman, etc.) to receive offerings and prayers.

The emergence of digital Shinto communities can be traced back to the advent of Web 2.0 with the creation of the Shinto Mailing List (ShintoML) on Yahoo! Groups in 2000. ShintoML was extremely active for a decade and enjoyed a membership of over one thousand people, though activity began to taper off in 2010 as ShintoML members migrated to Facebook following the platform’s upgrading of group features. Today, as many as ten thousand people are members of an active Facebook DSC, though community engagement spans multiple social media platforms including blogs, Reddit, Discord, YouTube, and Patreon. Some DSCs are public general Shinto interest groups, while others are private organizations for shrine supporters (sūkeisha 崇敬者) and confraternity (kō 講) members.

While DSC membership includes Japanese emigrants and their descendants (nikkeijin 日系人), the majority of members tend to be non-Japanese with general knowledge of Japanese history and culture gleaned from popular Japanese media, the internet, and brief trips to Japan. However, the most active members have extensive knowledge of Shinto gained through personal study, several years of membership in DSCs, and ritual practice. A 2019 survey of fifty DSC members and kamidana 神棚 (domestic altar) ownership indicates that the majority live in the United States and the UK, although membership truly spans the globe. Most were raised in nominally Christian households, though others grew up in atheist and Buddhist families. Official group leadership, on the other hand, is populated by a mix of Japanese, Nikkei, and Caucasian administrators (“admins”) or moderators (“mods”) with varying levels of institutional involvement, ranging from lay shrine caretaker to senior priest. DSC members share most beliefs and practices in common, though they may support different shrines and venerate different kami, the divinities at the center of Shinto ritual.

Often without direct access to traditional Shinto spaces and materials such as shrines or sacred talismans (ofuda お札) required for ritual practice in one’s home, compounded by a distinct lack of foundational Shinto texts (particularly translated into English) to which they may refer, transnational Shinto practitioners must make creative use of the sources available to them to establish shared knowledge, aesthetics, belief, and practice and properly manage their veneration of kami. These strategies include creating in-group informational resources relating to core Shinto beliefs, texts, and practices such as guidelines and FAQs (“frequently asked questions”), reviewing academic and popular publications on Shinto, sharing photographs of ritual materials and links to trusted vendors, and participating in in-person rituals and ritual livestreams.

Though often overlooked, digital Shinto communities hold significant relevance for the study of Japanese religion, online or digital religion, and globalization. Issues of authority and authenticity are raised as DSC members seek, construct, and contest the legitimization of personal approaches to Shinto within a polyvocal network of shrines from various traditions within Shinto, academic and popular literature, online forums, blogs, and popular media. Moreover, Shinto ontologies of the sacred are reconfigured as DSC members theorize and manage their relationships with kami, their local environment, and everyday experiences.",2001,2021,1435,879,Kaitlyn Ugoretz,45,Matthew Hamm,2021-03-20 19:06:44.476 +0100,2024-06-01 06:59:39.211 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.005150649841274256,2.244749927642267e-07,1.2069308708979197e-57,3.9036167166163735e-15,0.9948491256837265,2.569395876945335e-15

1083,Drukpa Kagyü School (Bhutan),43,Religious Group (v6),"The Drukpa Kagyü school belongs to the Kagyü school of Tibetan Buddhism. Standard Tibetan religious historiographies divide the Kagyü school into four main lineages: (1) the Phagdru Kagyü school with eight minor lineages founded by students of Phagmodrupa Dorje Gyelpo (1110–70), (2) the Karma Kagyü school, (3) the Barom Kagyü school, and (4) the Tshelpa Kagyü school. The Drukpa Kagyü school is counted among the minor lineages of (1) the Phagdru Kagyü school. However, the Drukpa Kagyü school is also heterogeneous with different sub-branches, such as the Bhutanese branch (lho ‘brug) with which this entry deals. 
In detail, the Drukpa Kagyü school goes back to the Buddhist master Tsangpa Gyaré Yeshe Dorje (1161–1211). In its beginnings, this school was associated with a strong emphasis on meditation and the simple lifestyle of mendicants. The Drukpa Kagyü school further split into three sub-branches, each established by another disciple of Tsangpa Gyaré Yeshe Dorje: (1) the middle Drukpa, (2) the upper Drukpa, and (3) the lower Drukpa. In fact, in reality, interactions between the sub-branches of the Drukpa Kagyü schools have been much more complex. 
Before the seventeenth century, Buddhist masters of all three sub-branches of the Drukpa Kagyü school were active and established religious institutions in Bhutan, such as Phajo Drukgom Zhikpo (1184–1251) or the famous “Madman of the Drukpa,” Drukpa Künlé (1455–1529). The Bhutanese branch of the Drukpa Kagyü school (Tib. lho ’brug) was newly established after the seventeenth century resulting from an additional split of the middle Drukpa Kagyü school into a “Northern,” i. e. Tibetan/Ladakhi, and “Southern,” i. e. Bhutanese branch. This split was caused by a dispute over Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel (1594–ca. 1651) as the rightful incarnation of the earlier eminent lineage master, the 4th Drukchen Künkhyen Pema Karpo (1527-92). This subsequently led to Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel’s flight to Bhutan and the foundation of the State of Bhutan in 1625/26.

In Bhutan, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel successfully institutionalized a system of governance that united religious and political authority, the “Joint Twofold System of Governance” (Tib. srid chos gnyis ldan). Under him, a regent exercised political power while the “Chief Abbot of Bhutan” oversaw the religious institutions and was the head of the new Bhutanese Drukpa Kagyü school-starting with the 1st Chief Abbot Pekar Jungné (1604–72). This “Joint Twofold System of Governance” was renewed in the Constitution of the Kingdom of Bhutan from 2008. As of today, the 70th Chief Abbot Tulku Jigmé Chödra (b. 1955) is in office. In particular, regarding the Drukpa Kagyü school as a religious group, the relationship between the societal spheres of religion and politics is complex and very interesting. 
As in the other Kagyü schools, the central doctrine and meditative system in the Bhutanese Drukpa Kagyü school is Mahāmudrā (Tib. phyag rgya chen po). Other essential teachings are the “Six Yogas of Nāropa,” called in this school the teachings of “Merging and Transference” (Tib. bsre ’pho), and the “Six Cycles of Equal Taste” (Tib. ro snyoms skor drug). In particular, since the seventeenth century, important doctrinal and ritualistic innovations and new teaching cycles by their founder Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel were introduced. This entry covers the Bhutanese Drukpa Kagyü school (Tib. lho ‘brug), but it does not include religious groups of the Drukpa Kagyü schools outside of Bhutan on a global scale, primarily associated with branches and monasteries of the Drukpa Kagyü school from Ladakh, Darjeeling, or Tibet.

1087,The Bogomils,43,Religious Group (v6),"A dualistic, Neo-Manichean sect founded in Bulgaria in the 10th c. Heavily influenced by the Paulicans, Bogomilism denied many of the basic tenets of Orthodox Christianity, including the Incarnation, the earthly miracles of Jesus, and the Old Testament in its entirety. Holding that the material world and all things of matter were the creation of Satan, the Bogomils were often at odds with ecclesiastical authorities in the Bulgarian and Byzantine Empires and preached a creed of active civil disobedience. Most of our information about them comes from polemics written against them, including those by Kosmas the Priest, Anna Komnene, Germanos II, and Euthymios Zigabenos. Only one piece of Bogomil apocrypha survives, the Interrogatio Johannis, or the Liber Secretus. Originally founded by an unknown priest in the mid-10th c. who took the name ‘Bogomil,’ which, according to Kosmas means ‘beloved of God’ in old Slavonic, by the 12th c. the sect could claim followers throughout the Balkans, Asia Minor, and in Constantinople itself, including amongst the elite. A core of ascetic practitioners adhered to an abstinence from meat, sexual intercourse, and wine. Actively persecuted throughout their existence, they nonetheless found many converts, particularly in the Balkans. In the early 13th c. they had become the dominant religious group in Bosnia, where they became known as the Patarenes, prompting crusading action against them. They subsequently entered Northern Italy and went on to influence the Cathars/Albigenses and the Waldensians. In Constantinople and Bulgaria their decline began in the 13th c. but they were not finally eradicated until Ottoman control over the Balkans was solidified in the 15th c.",969,1400,1224,913,Ian Randall,49,Ian Randall,2021-04-19 21:47:03.471 +0200,2022-01-25 00:27:49.770 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.23291896631249245,0.006315415334737313,1.940769069947784e-12,0.14222205614234001,0.6185435622084896,1.4136372606859936e-26
1108,Early Christianity and Monasticism in Egypt,43,Religious Group (v6),"Christian Church tradition in Egypt goes back to the 1st century CE with St. Mark as the first bishop of Alexandria. Historically, with Clement of Alexandria (c. 150-c. 215) Christianity is clearly an established, although minority, religion. The 3rd and 4th centuries show a Church and communities with eminent theologians, clergy, and monastics such as Origen (c. 184-c. 253) and Athanasius (295/9-373). The New Testament shows the ""ascetic tendency"" of Christianity in the 1st c.

1127,Anglican Church of Korea,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Anglican Church of Korea is a Christian denomination belonging to the Anglican Communion, the global family of churches with roots in the Church of England. Among the many Christian bodies in South Korea, the Anglican Church ranks among the smaller denominations, though it has experienced steady growth in recent years. The current membership numbers around 65,000 communicants. The Anglican Church is distinctive in incorporating both Roman Catholic and Protestant elements in its theology, organization, and worship. The church is divided into three dioceses, Seoul, Busan, and Daejeon, each headed by a bishop, and the three bishops rotate the national leadership as archbishop. Worship in the Anglican Church is similar to Roman Catholic practice, with ornate clerical vestments and said or chanted prayers. It also has monastic orders of monks and nuns. And yet, like other Anglican bodies, it is officially Protestant. The church does not recognize the authority of the pope and departs from Roman Catholic tradition in other ways, as in the ordination of women. Moreover, the Anglicans are different from both the Roman Catholics and Protestants in Korea in embracing more open and progressive views on such social issues as LGBTQ rights. In the past, church members have been active in the democratic movement, and one of the priorities of the church today is the reunification of the Korean peninsula. The first Anglican missionaries arrived in Incheon in 1890, under the leadership of Bishop Charles John Corfe. In laying down the church’s foundation in Korea, they established churches, as well as schools and hospitals throughout the country. The Anglican missionaries and clergy emphasized sensitivity to Korean culture. They built many churches in the traditional Korean style, and two of their bishops, Mark Napier Trollope and Richard Rutt, were pioneering scholars in Korean studies. During the Japanese colonial period (1910-1945), the Anglican Church was unique among Protestant bodies in having both the Koreans and the Japanese, as well as the English, work together with equal rights. In 1923, the church established St. Michael’s Theological Institute to train its clergy; it later expanded to become Sungkonghoe University, a major institution of higher learning in South Korea. In 1924, the cathedral Church of St. Mary the Virgin and St. Nicholas, the only example of Romanesque architecture in East Asia, was erected in Seoul. The first native Korean priest, Mark Kim (Kim Huijun), was ordained in 1915, and the first Korean bishop, Cheonhwan Lee, was installed in 1965. From its founding, the Anglican Church in Korea had been under the authority of the Archbishop of Canterbury. Then, in 1993, the church became an independent national church, an autonomous province within the Anglican Communion.",1890,2021,1271,954,Sean Kim,45,Matthew Hamm,2021-06-09 17:40:06.131 +0200,2022-04-09 21:44:46.702 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.10289570404474999,0.0027358469064437934,0.7991461272260284,0.09521348226147294,8.839561304797324e-06,2.7515748570704356e-34

1136,The Fellowship of Goodness 同善社 (Tongshanshe),43,Religious Group (v6),"Tongshanshe, the Fellowship of Goodness, was one of the largest redemptive societies in China before 1949. It was also labeled as a counterrevolutionary huidaomen (会道门) group by the Chinese Communist Party. In Chinese, the term “huidaomen” is composed of three different words: hui, dao, and men. “Hui”, “Dao”, and “Men” refer to any organization, association, or society composed of people who share similar interests or religious ideas. It can be either religious or secular or even both. Essentially, huidaomen was never a unified, monolithic organization in Chinese society. It was more like a general category and a generic term the government used to describe all voluntary associations. The term “huidaomen” has its precedent in late imperial China under the name “White Lotus Teachings.” The White Lotus sect was originally a lay Buddhist movement initiated by Monk Huiyuan of Lushan in the early fifth century.  According to B.J. Ter Haar, the name “White Lotus” was used by non-elites as an autonym for lay Buddhist gatherings before the mid-fourteenth century.  From the sixteenth century on, “White Lotus” was more and more frequently used and finally became a label for all potentially rebellious groups related to religion. Ter Haar further points out that by the late Ming dynasty, Christianity, millenarian teachings, lay Buddhist, and even sexual techniques were all labeled “White Lotus.”  But people within such groups did not necessarily call themselves “White Lotus.” This label existed only in official propaganda. “White Lotus” was only a generic term without precise specifications. The government could use it as a political label for all the voluntary associations that had rebellious potentials. The PRC’s use of “huidaomen” came from the same logic of political labeling. In 2004, the Chinese Academy of Social Science published two-volume primary sources on huidaomen called A Collection of Historical Materials on the Chinese Huidaomen: Their Organization and Distribution across A Century. The sources of this collection mainly come from more than 3,500 local gazetteers published in the PRC after October of 1949. In this collection of sources, the compilation committee defines huidaomen clearly as “feudal associations that operated secretly in order to spread their religious teachings.”  The book points out that the term “huidaomen” began to be used since the early PRC when the new government noticed the widespread networks of secret societies in China. Based on the information provided by the more than three thousand local gazetteers in A Collection of Historical Materials on the Chinese Huidaomen and my own case study of Poyang County in Jiangxi, I accept a broader definition of huidaomen, as the Chinese Academy of Social Science does. Almost all voluntary groups in China were indeed labeled as huidaomen from the late 1940s onward in political campaigns. It is inappropriate to define huidaomen exclusively as religious societies. Tongshanshe was one of the largest nation-wide redemptive societies in China during the Republican Era. During the late Qing period, Peng Ruzun (1868-1950) of Yongchuan County in Sichuan Province (now Chongqing) who was a former follower of the Way of Anterior Heaven (Xiantiandao) established Tongshanshe. Peng advocated a secular way of religious practice that participants in the Tongshanshe could become immortals through self-cultivation without fasting or becoming monks. Such secularized and simplified religious practice was widely welcomed. In 1910, Peng left Sichuan and went to Beijing to preach. Peng’s trip to Beijing gained tremendous support from former aristocrats of the Qing Dynasty and the leading warlords, including Duan Qirui and Cao Kun. In 1917, during the warlord period, Tongshanshe officially registered at the Northern Warlords Government in Beijing. Tongshanshe also established its central headquarters in Beijing. The government then provided Tongshanshe with formal support in developing branches across China. By 1923, Tongshanshe had already established provincial-level organizations in all provinces in China.  In Beijing, Tongshanshe ran a publishing house that published a number of religious books on self-cultivation and morality. Tongshanshe also functioned as a charity organization providing support for funerals of ordinary people and mass education.  In 1925, Peng built another Tongshanshe headquarters in Wuhan and claimed that Tongshanshe had a membership of over one million people. The name “Tongshanshe” even became a “free-floating signifier” of similar self-cultivation groups which shows the exceptional popularity of Tongshanshe in China. According to my study, Tongshanshe was largely an elite-based religious organization. Tongshanshe members were primarily rich merchants and even local politicians. Such an elite base was in sharp contrast to many traditional sectarian groups in China which were more attractive to the marginalized groups. Tongshanshe embraced religious syncretism, similar to many new religious organizations since the late Qing. It had widely absorbed Buddhism, Daoism, and Chinese popular religion. But Tongshanshe was predominantly a salvationist group. According to Tongshanshe's teachings, humans were living in a morally degenerating society. Peng Ruzun claimed that the end of the world was coming -- only those who firmly believed in Tongshanshe's teachings would survive the final apocalypse. The interpretation of Tongshanshe's millenarianism was not unified. Tongshanshe in different regions responded to the ""end of the world"" in diverse ways. Many local Tongshanshe groups in Southern China absorbed local military forces and practiced traditional Chinese martial arts, believing that martial arts would protect people from the final apocalypse. Other people, possibly under Peng Ruzun's instruction, believed that a new emperor would be born in China and would defeat all secular political powers. Both the Nationalist Government before 1949 and the Communist regime after 1949 saw Tongshanshe as a leading counterrevolutionary religious organization. From 1927 to the end of the Nationalist regime in 1949 on mainland China, the Nationalist government banned Tongshanshe multiple times. Due to the Nationalist Government's weak control of rural society, however, such suppressive policies were not carried out effectively outside big cities. After 1949, the Communist Party launched waves of Anti-Counterrevolutionary Campaigns. Labeled as a leading huidaomen group, Tongshanshe organizations were fatally destroyed by such campaigns and basically disappeared on the mainland. Tongshanshe also established its organizations in Taiwan and many Chinese communities in Southeast Asia. It continues operating today.",1910,1951,1280,958,Yupeng Jiao,45,Matthew Hamm,2021-06-18 07:56:20.693 +0200,2021-11-16 03:02:44.342 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.13609133122337164,0.09198783670480362,5.4571186033937545e-12,0.4892262863937215,0.24224745274073825,0.040447092931907846
1140,Early Medieval Confucianism,43,Religious Group (v6),"Early Medieval Confucians (Ru 儒) were individuals who were well-versed in the Five Classics (Wujing 五经) and their commentaries, as well as the Analects (Lunyu 论语) and the Classic of Filial Piety (Xiaojing 孝经). They viewed the founders of their tradition as the Duke of Zhou (Zhougong 周公) and Confucius (Kongzi 孔子), which is why contemporaries sometimes called Confucianism ""The Teachings of the Duke of Zhou and Confucius"" (Zhou Kong zhi dao 周孔之道). Members of this group referred to their tradition using several other names as well, such as the Teachings of the Confucians (Rujiao 儒教), the Teachings of Confucius (Kongjiao 孔教), the Teachings of the Sage (Shengjiao 圣教), and Teachings of the Way (Daojiao 道教). Many early medieval Confucians believed in the existence of spirits and all agreed on the importance of sacrifices. However, offerings had to be made to gods (nature deities and ancestors) sanctioned in the Five Classics and worship could not be excessive. The most important religious rite was the emperor’s sacrifice to Tian 天 (Heaven) in the capital’s southern suburb. Of course, there were some Confucians, such as Fan Zhen 范镇 (ca.450-510), who denied the existence of spirits. Others, such as Huangfu Mi 皇甫谧 (215-282), thought that the deities of Heaven and Earth were vigorously surveilling human activities and manifesting auspicious and inauspicious omens to reward good and punish bad moral conduct. Early Medieval Confucians put a particular stress on perfecting themselves by behaving according to the Three Ritual Codes (Sanli 三礼): Book of Rites (Li ji 礼记), the Rites of Zhou (Zhouli 周礼), and the Book of Etiquette and Ceremonies (Yili 仪礼). Self-cultivation was inter-connected with social behavior: a Confucian cultivated herself/himself by fulfilling social roles and performing good deeds. Early medieval courts especially valued Confucians for their ritual knowledge and command of the Five Classics. As a result, they often served emperors as advisors on ritual matters, Erudies (boshi 博士) at the Imperial College, and as tutors to the imperial princes. For early medieval Confucians, the main purpose of government was to secure the welfare of commoners and enhance their moral fiber through the process of moral transformation (jiaohua 教化). This meant setting an example for others through one's personal conduct and establishing schools that taught the Five Classics and proper deportment. One did not have to hold public office to have a positive effect on others through moral transformation. Early Medieval Confucians frequently served in office, yet some, to maintain their moral integrity, chose to become recluses, such as Huangfu Mi. Oftentimes, they would then establish a private school at their residence. The loose social organization that underpinned medieval Confucianism was precisely the master-student networks created through schools. Early Medieval Confucians were by no means exclusivist. Several of them also embraced either Daoism or Buddhism. Although the inner chapters of Ge Hong’s 葛洪 (283-343) The Master who Embraces Simplicity (Baopuzi 抱朴子) are devoted to ways of seeking immortality, his outer chapters express a Confucian critique on social and political matters. Yan Zhitui 颜之推 (531-591) viewed Confucianism as the outer teachings, while Buddhism were the more important inner teachings. Nevertheless, other Confucians, such He Chengtian 何承天 (370-447) and Fan Zhen were vehement critics of Buddhism, while Sun Sheng 孙盛 (ca. 301-373) was well known for his criticism of Daoism.",220,589,1373,671,Keith Knapp,45,Matthew Hamm,2021-06-24 20:47:56.552 +0200,2022-01-25 22:08:58.149 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),3.043321090274384e-56,1.6979941231062045e-24,1.701787998220684e-144,2.1671745724585725e-98,2.0052991841150343e-17,1.0
1149,Christianity in Tang China,43,Religious Group (v6),"Christians in Tang China gave a Chinese name for Christianity: Jingjiao 景教, a term translated as ""the Luminous Religion/Teaching"" or ""the Illustrious Religion"" or ""the Brilliant Teaching"". Not a few scholars regard it as a ""Nestorian"" Church, a derogatory term used to call the Church of the East or East Syriac Christianity in the Western ecclesiastical traditions (Latin West and Greek East). The degree to which the Church of the East has to do with the Archbishop of Constantinople, Nestorius, who was condemned as a heresiarch during the Council of Ephesus (431), is a point that has been re-examined by a few patristic scholars. With the help of newly-discovered materials in Syriac, scholars such as James F. Bethune-Baker, Robert V. Sellers, Aloys Grillmeier, and Sebastian P. Brock began to question this ingrained preconception from the Western perspective. Scholars like Brock emphasize that the Syriac tradition, of which the Church of the East is a part, has a much earlier history than the so-called Nestorianism.

The story of Christianity in Tang China begins in 635 with the coming of Aluoben 阿羅本, a Persian波斯/Daqin大秦 monk who introduced his religion in front of the second emperor of the dynasty and paved the way for the spread of Christianity in the confines of the Tang empire. This story is recorded on the famous Christian stele discovered at Xi'an in 1623/5. The text of the inscription was composed by Jingjing 景淨, who was a priest and chorespiscopus of China. The stone was set in place in 781 probably in or near the Jingjiao temple in the imperial capital Chang'an (today's Xi'an). It proffers a brief history of Jingjiao in 146 years, which arguably echoes the rise and decline of the Tang empire. The presence of Jingjiao in the Tang period was also evidenced by Chinese official records, such as Tang Huiyao 唐會要 (Institutional History of Tang), and other Chinese documents by Buddhists or Daoists. The history of Jingjiao came to an end with the issue of the edict of 845, which initiated the persecution of Buddhism as well as other foreign religions including Daqin Jingjiao. However, historical documents of the 9th and 10th centuries mentioned that a few Jingjiao Christians still survived in China after 845.

In the 20th and 21st centuries, more documents and archaeological discoveries (like tomb epitaphs) have been found, especially at Dunhuang's Hidden Library. These documents not only confirm the authenticity of the stele but also enrich our knowledge of Jingjiao. The understanding of Jingjiao and the community of Jingjiao Christians, as shown in this entry, is built on the Xi'an inscription and these manuscripts, despite being fragmentary. These Jingjiao documents include Xuting Mishisuo jing 序聽迷詩所經 (“Book of Jesus-Messiah” or “Book of listening to the Messiah”), Yishen lun 一神論 (“Discourse on the One God”), Da Qin Jingjiao Sanwei mengdu zan 大秦景教三威蒙度讚 (“Hymn in adoration of the Three Persons and of salvation”), Zunjing 尊經 (“Book of Veneration”), Zhixuan anle jing 志玄安樂經 (“Book on attaining mysterious serenity and joy”), Da Qin Jingjiao Xuanyuan zhiben jing 大秦景教宣元至本經 (“Book of the proclamation of the highest origin of origins”), as well as Da Qin Jingjiao Dasheng tongzhen guifa zan 大秦景教大聖通真歸法讚 (“Hymn of praise for Great Holiness, attaining the truth, and returning to the dharma"").

In front of the stele and other Jingjiao documents, there was a community of Jingjiao Christians, who were mostly migrants of Iranian origin and spoke Persian or Sogdian. The bilingual (Chinese-Syriac) stele itself tells of their hybrid identity. On the one hand, Jingjiao was linked with the Church of the East in the Middle East. Syriac played a significant role in the theology and liturgy of Jingjiao. The hierarchy of the Church of the East is indicated on the Xi'an stele: both Chinese and Syriac names of the Catholicos Henanisho were engraved on the stele. On the other hand, the text engaged with the historical and religious contexts of Tang China by employing a few terminologies of the pre-existing Three Religions/Teachings (sanjiao, 三教), such as Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism. This was the first attempt at transmitting the Christian ideas, such as Christology and the Trinity, in the Chinese language, more specifically in Middle Chinese. In the Jingjiao corpus, introducing the idea of the Only God, who Jesus Christ is, what the Messiah teaches were some major tasks of Jingjiao Christians.",618,906,1297,977,Dingjian Xie,45,Matthew Hamm,2021-07-05 18:27:49.833 +0200,2021-10-18 12:48:36.037 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),8.483666708527983e-12,0.9999179826855372,3.576524307545109e-11,7.1927897976700014e-12,8.201726302105512e-05,1.9665147897694284e-30
1162,Lingbao dafa,43,Religious Group (v6),"Lingbao dafa 靈寶大法, the Great Rites of Numinous Treasure, also known as Duren dafa度人大法, the Great Rites of Salvation, is an aggregate of Daoist ritual practices. In the Daoist Canon, certain scriptures, such as the Great Rites of Shangqing Lingbao (Shangqing Lingbao dafa上清靈寶大法), classified into the Lingbao Daoist tradition have comprehensive descriptions and instructions for the practice. By using series of techniques like methods (fa 法), incantations (zhou 呪/咒), talisman (fu 符), and statements (shu 疏), it first applied to self-promotion to accommodate the body and mind with the Dao; and then, it was put to use in public ritual performance for universal salvation and expel demonic forces. 
The Lingbao dafa is a production of a combination of many new exorcisms and therapeutic methods in the Song-Yuan time (12th-14th century). Continuing the mediation practices in Shangqing 上清 [Supreme Purity] revelation, the Lingbao dafa used meditation techniques like visualization, concentration, and inner observation for the inner body promotion. The Shenxiao 神霄 [Divine Empyrean] tradition was borrowed by the Lingbao dafa in terms of its exorcism through the Thunder Rites (leifa 雷法). Attached to the view of deliverance in the Scripture on Salvation (Duren jing 度人經), it built on the traditional Daoist Retreat ritual (zhaiyi 齋儀) to formulate many salvation approaches, mainly practiced in the Yellow Register Retreat (Huanglu zhai 黃籙齋).In the Lingbao dafa, the most distinctive ritual performed in the Yellow Register Retreat is the Liturgy of Salvation of the Deceased through the Alchemical Refinement (liandu 鍊度儀). Because the Lingbao dafa featured in absorbing and transforming rituals from different branches of Daoism, Buddhism, and popular religions, it is hard for scholars to identify the exact relationship between the Lingbao dafa and other Song-Yuan new methods.
Although the movement of Lingbao Daoism appeared as early as the 4th century CE, the organized practice of Lingbao dafa was not formed until the 12th century. It was popularized in Southern Song China in the lower Yangzi River Basin, however, its spreading was not limited to Zhejiang 浙江, Jiangxi 江西, and Jiangsu 江蘇, but also as south as Guangdong 廣東. The Lingbao dafa, unlike many conservative religious ritual performances, was a very popular practice among both religious specialists and non-religious. All people without caring for their social, political, and economic background could be a practitioner of the Lingbao dafa, even when they still kept their other beliefs with them in Buddhism, Confucianism, local beliefs, etc. Ritual masters well known for their practice or compilation in the Lingbao dafa trace back to the Ning Quanzhen 寧全真 (1101-81, also known as Ning Benli寧本立), 王契真 (fl. ca. 1250), 金允中 (fl. 1224-1225), 林靈真 (1239-1303, also known as Lin Weifu 林偉夫) and so forth. Moreover, the Daoist master Lu Xiujing陸修靜 (406-477), due to his contribution in the composition of liturgical texts and normalization of early Daoist Retreat, his work on the early Lingbao tradition is a fundamental source when examining the Lingbao dafa. All in all, the Lingbao dafa was a medley of many new Song-Yuan Daoist methods; it witnessed the rapid growth of Daoism in the aspect of self-cultivation practice and public ritual service, thus, a valuable material concerning the Daoist ritual history.",400,1400,1307,969,Chaojan Chang,51,Michael Naparstek,2021-07-27 05:47:53.940 +0200,2021-10-14 05:25:03.042 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.17719576958072328,0.18839276375392147,0.4135133588248697,0.20324041298891082,0.017657694851572175,2.3256459110512303e-15
1172,Twofold Mystery (Chongxuan 重玄),43,Religious Group (v6),"Chongxuan 重玄 (“Twofold Mystery”) is a Daoist teaching developed by early medieval Daoist monastics; the most prominent was Cheng Xuanying 成玄英 (fl. 631–655). The name Chongxuan derives from the fact that the Daoist thinkers, like Cheng Xuanying or Li Rong 李榮 (fl. after 650), used their commentaries to the Daode jing 道德經, and specifically to the expression xuanzhi you xuan玄之又玄 in the last sentence of the first chapter, to develop their own version of the four steps of continued negation (also called si ju 四句, or tetra lemma), which had become known in China predominantly with Buddhist Mādhyamika teachings, as an approach to realize Dao conceptually.// The earliest traces of Chongxuan thought can be found in writings and anecdotes from Daoists active at the courts of the Northern and Southern Dynasties (420-589 CE), it became popular in the early 7th century during the Sui 隋 (581-618 CE) and Tang 唐(618-907 CE) dynasties in the capital Chang’an. Furthermore, presumably because of individual monks travelling and spreading the new teaching, it spread also in Sichuan. Early 7th century Chang’an saw fierce competition and heated court debates between Buddhists and Daoists. Multi-level interactions between Buddhists and Daoists, from the reading of each other’s texts, to the participation in public debates, to the struggle for imperial support and patronage, was most probably the immediate background of the development the intellectual innovations of chongxuan teachings.// Interaction and competition between Buddhists and Daoists gained an important political dimension in the Tang dynasty due to the imperial clan’s claim that they, the Li 李 family, were descended from Laozi 老子, whose surname was also said to be Li 李. This claim was an opportunity for the advancement of Daoism, but it required that Laozi (associated in his divinized form with the Celestial Masters tradition dominant in the north) be the principal deity. This was potentially problematic because Daoism, as it was proposed by the clergy of the capital Chang’an, seems to have relied much on the southern tradition of the Three Caverns (a synthesis of the Shangqing 上清, Lingbao 靈寶,and Sanhuang 三皇 traditions), which considered the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Commencement (Yuanshi Tianzun 元始天尊) to be the highest deity.// To resolve the clash between these two pantheons, Chongxuan theorists turned to the most distinctive feature of their teaching, the use of the logic of the tetra lemma (otherwise known as the four-fold negation from), which they had adapted from the Madhyamaka Buddhist tradition. Combining this mode of logic with the Two-Body theory (a Daoist adaptation of the Buddhist theory of the Three Bodies of the Buddha), Chongxuan theorists were able to argue for the logical interpenetration of the Dao, apparently separate deities, and the sage. In doing so, they redefined Laozi and the Heavenly Worthy as “response bodies” (yingshen 應身) of the Dao and thus unified the pantheon, making sure Laozi could be treated as the highest deity.// This interpenetration also enabled Chongxuan figures to transfer seemingly anthropomorphic characteristics, such as wisdom and compassion, to the ultimate entity of the Dao, which is inherently devoid of any specific characteristics. They thus defined the Dao as a compassionate entity that actively worked for the salvation of all beings and thereby responded to Buddhist critiques that Daoism did not offer the same type of soteriological benefits as Buddhism.// In fact, Chongxuan theorists developed a sophisticated soteriological model in which individuals could cultivate themselves and return to the Dao, thereby becoming immortal sages. Sages, moreover, were thought to deliberately return from the Dao to the mortal plane (much like a Buddhist Boddhisattva) in order to actively work for the salvation of all entities. They did so, it was thought, because they were motivated by the same type of compassion as the Dao.",500,700,1317,708,Friederike Assandri,6,Matthew Hamm,2021-08-19 19:13:01.151 +0200,2022-03-14 22:57:18.398 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.5275139005211522,0.00023048150756019902,7.05849302313649e-33,2.360442492694553e-11,0.47225561794768317,5.48891212040498e-28
1178,Modern Mystery School (MMS),43,Religious Group (v6),"Modern Mystery School (MMS), formerly known as the Rocky Mountain Mystery School (RMMS), is variously described as a spiritual path, a spiritual business, and a spiritual lineage. It was founded in 1997 by Gudni Gudnason and is headquartered in Toronto and Tokyo. MMS emerged in Japan at the height of the ‘spirituality boom’ and the proliferation of spiritual therapeutic techniques that are often associated with the eclectic categories of Western esotericism or New Age. 
MMS teaches that there are seven Mystery Schools in the world where esoteric knowledge is transmitted in a continuous linage for thousands of years. While these Mystery Schools are closed and shrouded in secrecy, MMS advertises “no more secrets” and provides open initiation through an ascending spiritual syllabus. 

The course material is remarkably ecumenical, drawing from Kabbalah, Theosophy, Wicca, Mikkyo, Tibetan Buddhism, Christianity, ancient Egyptian cosmologies, Norse mythology, Tarot and Reiki (among others). Tibetan ritual objects (purbha) and concepts (Shambhala) are central to ritual practice and MMS eschatology, as are ritual swords based on knighthood from European classical antiquity. Workshops and seminars are offered at both MMS headquarters and in hundreds of spiritual salons (saron). 

Upon completion of one of seven initiatory steps (Adept, Healer, Ritual Master 1, 2, 2.5, and 3, culminating with Guide), initiates are awarded certifications and are empowered by MMS to practice and teach specific modalities. This system of spiritual credentialism, which allows students to become teachers (called Healers or Guides) who enlist their own paying clients, complicates traditional ideas of 'the religious' and blurs the distinction between belief and business. For more recent theorization of the exchanges of spirituality and materiality, see BBB under 'Online Sources'. There is an ongoing debate, playing out on social media, traditional print media, and various online forums, about the business model of MMS (see 'Online Sources' for a sample). 

MMS teachings are diverse and have flexible canonicity based on Mr. Gudnason revealing new modalities and making eschatological prophesies. There is no formal canon of scripture, although the Hermetica and Kabbalah are central. ‘The Cherubim’s Flames’ is a booklet of ritual incantations and mantras published by MMS and used by initiates. MMS primarily gives oral teachings, available in seminars, following in the tradition of the Mystery School for thousands of years, as described by Mr. Gudnason. Prominent teachings include both the universal realization of humanity’s oneness as Galactic Beings and the self-realization of our own individuality. 

Through guided workshops with a focus on aesthetics, self-branding and self-based leadership (Knowing Thyself), initiates (especially in Japan) are encouraged to increasingly individualize: to discover their unique “channeling contract” with a specific deity (the Channeling School is only available in Japan); to be given a personalized Ritual Master name by a lineage Ipsissimus during the 2nd-step Ritual Master initiation ceremony that speaks to their unique mission on Earth; and to “find joy” through reconnecting with sources of daily pleasure. Guides are encouraged to embrace the ""Royal Life"" by discovering their unique embodiment of divinity and their truest self-presentation. This can include beautifying interior designs of homes and spiritual salons, an overall material upgrade in the quality of life, and fashion makeovers (Mr. Gudnason practices “Sacred Dandyism”; Mrs. Gudnason has a fashion brand; and several Japanese Guides actively promote their physical self-transformation as an aspect of Being Royal through the NEW LIFE online magazine). Initiates are also encouraged to realize their cosmic significance as part of En-sof  (""The Divine Light"") in spreading Light, combating Darkness, and helping to usher in the future of balance, peace and harmony (Shambhala). 

MMS social organization includes Founder Gudni, whose Sacred Dandy style and extraordinary (and extraterrestrial) biographical claims might be thought of as close to Weberian charismatic authority; Hideto Nakagome and Dave Lanyon—all ‘Third Order Ipsissimuses’ with specialized regional and theological roles; the ‘Council of 12’ women, six from the West and six from the East, who “execute the directives of the Hierarchy of Light” and are deeply involved with the interworking of MMS; high-level leadership who perform various roles (Grand Oracle, secretary, accountant and producers, among others often working in pairs or groups) and provide marketing/business tips to Guides; hundreds of certified Healers and Guides who may operate their own spiritual salons; and thousands of Adepts, low-level initiates and followers who may receive counseling at MMS salons or attend workshops at the headquarters. Japanese students are overwhelmingly female and often participating in the spiritual marketplace seeking community, self-transformation, healing from specific forms of trauma, and an enlarged sense of self amidst patriarchal social expectations.

1180,Batak Traditional Religions,43,Religious Group (v6),"This entry covers practitioners of the Batak Traditional Religion, a system of practices that has been typically referred to as a traditional belief (aliran kepercayaan) by the Indonesian government as opposed to a formally recognized religion (agama). However, the Batak traditional religion has gone through various local iterations, focused on the worship of royalty as god, millenarianism, modern reforms, and a re-application of an appeal toward traditional cultural understandings. The traditional Batak religion is also often described as a form of Hinduism that is heavily localized, specific to the ethnic context of the Batak people, or Batak Hinduism.",1600,2020,1325,520,William Noseworthy,37,William Noseworthy,2021-08-31 06:01:06.432 +0200,2021-08-31 06:02:14.458 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.5523364476592414,0.00025996254413372004,7.958959466378449e-33,1.9245395045076014e-11,0.44740358977737954,4.065702651397876e-28
1183,Religion at Nippur in the Ur III period,43,Religious Group (v6),"Nippur was the unrivaled religious capital during the period dominated by the kings of the IIIrd dynasty centered at Ur in nowadays southern Iraq. As the city of the supreme god Enlil it can be considered as the ""Mesopotamian Vatican"" latest since the Akkad period (c. 2350 BC). The centrality of Nippur at the border between Akkad (North) and Sumer (South) might have triggered the factor of importance of the site. During Ur III times large scale construction programs at the East-mound of the site with the temple of Enlil as well as that of Inanna underlines the importance of Nippur during this period. As Ur III period is considered as a kind of ""Sumerian renaissance"" it was important for the state ideology to venerate the Old Sumerian gods. Probably building on an ancient custom, the kings of Ur were crowned to be kings of Sumer and Akkad at Nippur. 
Reconstructed with the help of the Puzrish-Dagan (modern Drehem) texts which were excavated illegally at a site nearby Nippur, the ritual calendar can be reconstructed. Each month a festival was celebrated which was often related to a specific god as, for example, the gu4-si-su (sum.) festival of the second month (c. April/May) which was dedicated to Enlils son Ninurta who was also known as, lugal gu4-si-su (sum.), ""king of the Gusisu"". One of the most important local religious celebrations was the festival at the nearby site of Tummal (modern Dlehim) with a boat procession to the ancient cultic center of Enlils wife Ninlil. Additionally, festivals related to agriculture like  the seeding (fourth month, sum. shu-numun) were also common. Other important gods at Nippur were the healing goddess Gula/Ninisina in the local form of Nintinuga (sum. ""Lady who revives the dead""). Her temple was probably localized by excavations at the northern West-mound.",-2100,-2000,1936,1012,Bernhard Schneider,50,Andrew Danielson,2021-09-02 01:18:34.211 +0200,2023-04-24 11:46:08.917 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.37216299726662294,0.47902178223037717,1.4482500118372116e-11,0.05095133813149904,0.09267308785192221,0.0051907945050961735
1189,Yādiya/Sam'al,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Kingdom of Yādiya, based at the city of Samʾal (modern Zincirli Höyük), was founded sometime in the 10th century BCE. Though the city’s history stretches back to the Early Bronze Age, it was destroyed during the Late Bronze Age and remained unoccupied until it was resettled at the foundation of the kingdom. The kingdom’s cultural practices are particularly notable for their combination of traditions otherwise known from so-called Aramean and Neo-Hittite polities. The kingdom also incorporated elements of Assyrian culture derived from interactions that began during the reign of Shalmenser III in the mid-9th century. Later, the kingdom became a vassal of Tiglath-Pileser III in the late 8th century. At the end of the same century, the kingdom was abolished incorporated into the Assyrian empire as a province.
Primary sources attest to a heterogeneous population in Yādiya. An early inscription describes two social groups (called mškbm and the bʿrrm) in a conflict that was resolved through the efforts of the king. The distinction between these groups remains unknown. While there is evidence for speech communities utilizing Semitic (particularly Samʾalian) and Indo-European languages (particularly Luwian), there is no direct evidence for these groups acknowledging ethnic or other social divisions between them. The royal family of Yādiya, for instance, primarily composed royal inscriptions in Semitic languages and sometimes took Semitic names, but Luwian names were somewhat more common. 
The pantheon of Yādiya may have been vast, and a broken inscription from the site makes mention of “the thousand gods,” making it the sole Iron Age polity known to have continued the Hittite tradition of referring to their pantheon in that way. More specifically, various kings are known to have been devoted to personal deities (such as King Gabbar’s tutelary deity Baʿal-Ṣemed), but the dynastic god was Rakib-El. Based on comparative evidence from the surrounding region, this dynastic god may have been a storm-god. Other storm-gods were worshipped as well, however, chief among them Hadad whose primary cult place may have been Gerçin. The Katumuwa inscription further mentions a Hadad of the Vineyards and a Hadad the Host as though they are separate deities, but the precise relationship between them is unknown. The same is true for Resheph and Arq-Resheph. Apart from these, the Yādiyans revered a mix of deities known from other Levantine and Mesopotamian sources, including the sun-god Shamash, the moon-god of Haran, and Baʿal-Ḥammon as well as the goddesses Kubaba and Nikkurawas. It is theorized that Kubaba may have been the consort of Rakib-El, but this is not confirmed by the epigraphic evidence. 
The best understood of Yādiya’s rituals were devoted to the royal family. These included but were not limited to mortuary feasts performed on a semi-regular basis. These were carried out in large ceremonial plazas on the acropolis, and in the royal necropolis at Gerçin. In the 8th century, such rituals were extended to non-royal elites as well and carried out in household contexts. Candidates for temples have not been extensively studied, so possible temple rituals remain mysterious.",-920,-713,1333,1015,Timothy Hogue,50,Andrew Danielson,2021-09-04 20:20:29.308 +0200,2022-01-20 02:39:53.172 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.49163764531477977,0.29868651095664445,1.3872902167851666e-11,0.07386638685128413,0.13466653251841382,0.001142924345004973

1196,K’iche’ (Quiché),43,Religious Group (v6),"This entry focuses on the K’iche’ living in the town of Chichicastenango, Guatemala, around the time of 1930. The principal ethnographic authority, Bunzel (1952), indicated that at this time, Chichicastenango remained relatively isolated from intensive industrialization, European Colonialism, and Christianity. Although the arrival of European (primarily Spanish) colonists brought elements of Catholocism and political changes, the traditional K’iche’ cultural and religious beliefs and practices remained. Consequently, K’iche’ religious beliefs were somewhat syncretic, blending and incorporating aspects of Catholocism with traditional beliefs. Bunzel (1952:163) described that the Church and State are one in Chichicastenango, and “the problems of the individual soul, of life and death, sin and salvation, the relationship of man to the supernatural and to his own conscience are worked out through other institutions. The Church is primarily political--a state temple in which the rules and their surrogates discharge their religious obligations to the commonwealth.” In addition to church officials, the chuchqajau serves as a religious practitioner and specializes as a professional diviner, performing ceremonies for pay. These ceremonies occur during major turning points in life, such as baptism, marriage, and death. Other events in life have ceremonial aspects as well, such as building a house, planting and harvesting, and selling land. Ceremonies typically include a feast for the officiating individual and offerings to supernatural beings (Bunzel, 1952:84). Larger, communal ceremonies occur during fiestas, which mark significant holidays and are important to religious, social, and political aspects of K’iche’ culture.

1210,Mende,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Mende have historically lived in Western Africa; this entry focuses on the Mende living in the vicinity of the town of Bo, Sierra Leone around the time of 1945. At this time, a section was the basic political unit and consisted of several towns and villages. A section chief held political leadership of each section, and a paramount chief led the chiefdom as a whole. Secret societies, namely the Poro and Sande, served crucial roles in transmitting social norms, rules of conduct, and performance of ritual activity. The secret societies held a close connection with certain spirits and rituals, and embodied supernatural power. The chief, although a secular figure, “acted as general patron of the more important secret societies, such as the Poro and the Sande, and was expected to sponsor the various ceremonies called for in connection with the ancestral cult and related forms of worship and propitiation” (Little, 1951:182). Supernatural beings, in addition to ancestral spirits, included non-human spirits, and a supreme high god who created the world but is said to not have an active role in the day-to-day life of humans.

1218,Yiguan Dao/I-Kuan Tao 一貫道,43,Religious Group (v6),"Yiguan Dao/I-Kuan Tao 一貫道is a salvationist and syncretic religion that originated in the late 19th century in Shandong Province and soon spread throughout other provinces of China. Today it claims to have millions of followers across from Taiwan, Southeast Asia, and many other regions in the world, as well as mainland China where it cannot operate openly. The name Yiguan Dao, meaning the Consistent Way, comes from a phrase by Confucius in the Analects, 4:15, “My way has been consistent 吾道一以貫之.” Yiguan Dao has demonstrated its effort to evangelize the sanjiao tradition, namely, Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism, although it is usually poised as the ultimate inheritor of the Five Teachings/Religions (the sanjiao plus Christianity and Islam). 
The origin of Yiguan Dao can be traced back to Luo Jiao, a sectarian religion created by 
Luo Qing (1442-1527) during the Ming dynasty (1368-1644), which in turn attributed its ancestry to Taiping Dao, a Daoist sect involved in the rebellion of the Yellow Turbans at the end of the Later Han dynasty (25—220). Luo Jiao later evolved into several sects, and one of them was Xiantian Dao, which was suppressed by the Qing government in the early 19th century. In the 1870’s, Xiantian Dao further split into several independent sects, one of which later developed into Yiguan Dao (originally named “mohou yizhujiao”—religion for final salvation).
The founding of Yiguan Dao with its modern look is generally attributed to Wang Jueyi (1821-1886), who extensively reformed its teachings and rituals in the late 19th century and who is venerated as the 15th patriarch of the tradition. Under the leadership of Zhang Tianran (1889-1947), its 18th patriarch, Yiguan Dao enjoyed rapid growth during the 1930s and 1940s and spread to many provinces of the country. With the establishment of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, Yiguan Dao was proscribed an illegal secret society and heretical cult and was eradicated from society as part of the antireligious campaign. At the meantime, however, it grew steadily in Taiwan for decades in spite of the persecution of the Kuomingtang government, a policy that was not abolished until 1987.
Yiguan Dao embraces an eschatological and soteriological philosophy and presents itself as the only way to salvation. The highest deity worshipped by the followers of Yiguan Dao is called Wusheng Laomu, or the Eternal Venerable Mother, and its worship hall is usually highlighted by the statue of Maitreya Buddha flanked by the statues of the monk Ji Gong and Avalokitesvara (Guan Yin). According to the eschatology and soteriology of Yiguan Dao, human history is divided into three eras: Qingyang Qi or Green Yang Era, Hongyang Qi or Red Yang Era, and Baiyang Qi or White Yang Era. While Dipankara Buddha and Gautama Buddha presided over salvation in the Green Yang Era and the Red Yang Era, respectively, Maitreya Buddha presides over the third period of salvation, the White Yang Era (from 1912 onward).
Yiguan Dao practitioners regard the initiation ceremony, called Qiu Dao (seeking the Dao), as the most important ritual, which involves the ""offering of the Three Treasures""—the saving grace from the Eternal Venerable Mother. The initiation ceremony articulates the exclusiveness of the membership of Yiguan Dao and only through this ritual can a new member be accepted into the congregation. The members of Yiguan Dao maintain a clear self-identification and call each other Dao Qin (fellows of Dao).  
Yiguan Dao followers generally believe that the corruption of humanity and natural disasters are associated with the end of the White Yang Era, which ushers in a final salvation. Thus, they emphasize the cultivation of Dao as the opportunity for repentance and purification. This moralizing doctrine paves the way for what scholars have called the “confucianization” of Yiguan Dao, as is clearly seen in its guiding principle: “Respect Heaven and Earth, hold courtesy toward deities; be patriotic to nation and faithful in engagements, cultivate morality and uphold rites; be filial to parents, honor teachers and masters, be trustworthy to friends, be in harmony with neighbors; rectify evil and approach good; be clear with five cardinal relationships and eight virtues.” In recent years, Yiguan Dao increasingly draws on Confucian notions to recruit young followers, and the Classics-Recitation Movement (Dujing Yundong) that has swept Taiwan and mainland China in recent decades is largely attributable to the campaign of Yiguan Dao.",1870,2021,1366,989,Yong Chen,45,Matthew Hamm,2021-10-19 19:07:58.911 +0200,2022-03-15 19:32:55.896 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.1262560566767944,0.0034714948667133906,0.7801109133241206,0.09013472485079879,2.6810281572858294e-05,7.250670900758858e-33
1223,Toda,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Toda historically inhabited the Nilgiri Mountains of southern India; this entry focuses around the time of 1900. At this time, the Toda had been in contact with Europeans, and India was under British rule. However, according to the principal ethnographic authority William Rivers (1906) European influence had minimal effect on Toda religious beliefs and activities. The Toda social structure included two endogamous divisions: the Teivaliol and Tartharol, each with several subdivisions (clans). Political leadership was maintained by the naim; a governing council composed of five individuals from various clans. The naim also held functions in connection with religious activities, deciding when ceremonies would take place and regulating the ti (sacred buffalo and accompanying dairies and grazing lands). As a pastoralist society, the Toda relied heavily on their cattle and dairies. The cattle played a significant role in the daily aspects of life (e.g., subsistence, economic), and also featured prominently in religious beliefs and practices. Certain buffalo are considered sacred and are associated with sacred dairies, ceremonies, and are tended to by dairymen-priests. Organized in a hierarchical manner, each level of dairy had its own grade of ritual and priesthood, with an increasing need for ritual purity and elaborateness of rituals for daily tasks. The ti comprises the most sacred level and is maintained by the palol (dairyman-priest, religious practitioner) who is selected from the Teivaliol division. The main types of Toda religious ceremonies are those associated with the dairy and those accompanying life-cycle events.

1227,Polytheistic Pre-Islamic South Arabia,43,Religious Group (v6),"Although the Bronze Age in ancient South Arabia (modern-day Yemen) is still poorly understood, there is a wealth of archaeological and epigraphic data for reconstructing the region’s history from the beginning of the first millennium BCE onward. While epigraphs in the Ancient South Arabian script may date as early as the 11th century BCE, texts useful to reconstructing South Arabian history and religion only truly begin to emerge from the 8th century BCE onward. These epigraphs attest to a plurality of peoples and city-states who worshipped a variety of gods. Most important among these are the four kingdoms, Saba, Maʿīn, Qataban, and Ḥaḍramawt, the former three which occupied the western highlands of Yemen while the latter was concentrated further east along Wadi Ḥaḍramawt. Each of these kingdoms had its own language (Sabaic, Minaic, Qatabanic, Ḥaḍramitic) and religion, which consisted in worship of the common high god ʿAthtar in addition to a kingdom’s own patron deity (Almaqah for Saba, Wadd for Maʿīn, ʿAmm for Qataban, and Sin for Ḥaḍramawt) and a national pantheon of lesser gods. 
	The influence of South Arabian religion was not restricted to modern-day Yemen. As early as 700 BCE, Sabaic epigraphs, gods, and religious architecture appear in northeast Africa. This eventually disappears in the second half of the first millennium BCE, a time during which other South Arabian kingdoms notably began to expand. Ḥaḍramawt then ventured eastward into modern-day Oman, where it founded a trading port at modern Khor Rori south of Salalah in the Dhofar. In the western South Arabian highlands, a new kingdom called Ḥimyar emerged. Over the next centuries, these Ḥimyarites would gradually increase their influence until they finally conquered all of South Arabia in the late third/early fourth century CE. Under their hegemony, state-sponsored polytheism continued until at least 360 CE, to which the latest known polytheistic text dates. Following this, South Arabia adopted a new monotheistic religion, resulting in the polytheistic gods disappearing from the epigraphic record.",-800,360,1376,1010,Jason Weimar,50,Andrew Danielson,2021-10-25 23:23:33.389 +0200,2021-12-10 02:05:54.348 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.4416163911351737,0.32273766961325,1.4740340770679774e-11,0.04500290252986931,0.18486859807430173,0.005774438632664944
1229,Three Self Patriotic Movement (TSPM),43,Religious Group (v6),"The Three Self Patriotic Movement (TSPM) is a politically oriented ""patriotic religious association"" that was established in the early 1950s by a group of diverse but prominent Protestants. The movement's name stems from its core principles of ""self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation."" Strictly speaking, the movement is not a church, but rather a collection of Protestant churches that are affiliated with the movement and who register with the state through the TSPM. The organization aims to represent Protestant believers in China and engage with the Chinese state on their behalf. To that end, TSPM maintains committees at not only the national level, but also the provincial, municipal, and county/district levels. The TSPM works in partnership with the China Christian Council, whose remit is to deal with doctrinal and pastoral issues, and, together, they are referred to as the ""Two Committees"" (lianghui 两会).
 
This entry understands the TSPM through the lens of several, TSPM-affiliated churches in the city of Huanghaicheng, a pseudonym for a city of approximately 2 million people on China's eastern seaboard. The research informing this entry is Mark McLeister's extensive ethnographic work in Huanghaicheng, which has been continuing since 2009. Because of this detailed focus, there may be slight variations between the answers to the questions presented here and other TSPM-affiliated churches in different parts of China.

TSPM-affiliated churches are distinguished by their belief in a threefold yet single God (made up of God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit), who is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent, who created the world, and who is purely good. As well, members of TSPM-affiliated churches believe in an immortal soul that can be rewarded in Heaven or punished in Hell after death and that Jesus Christ is the messiah who will return at the end of the world to save the faithful and create a “New Heaven and New Earth” (xintianxindi 新天新地).

TSPM-affiliated churches understand the universe in terms of a three-fold division between that which is “of God” shuling 属灵 (and Jesus and the Holy Spirit), that which is related to Satan (sadan mogui 撒旦魔鬼) and “evil spirits” (xieling 邪灵), and that which is “of the flesh” (shu ruoti 属弱体) or “of the world” (shushi 属世). Individual sins and sinful acts act lead to a kind of break or opening (pokou 破口) in one’s spiritual life that can allow evil spirits to influence and even dominate one’s life. Evil spirits are also thought to be capable of possessing individuals or “playing tricks” (kaiwanxiao 开玩笑) on them such as by preventing keys from working in locks or hiding one’s keys. 
 
Previous scholarship has tended to present TSPM churches as staid and austere, befitting the organization's image as a modern religion, while discussing ""household churches"" as forms of ""popular Christianity"" that deal with more sensorially and aesthetically rich forms of religious experience in a way that echoes other popular religious practices in China. However, detailed ethnographic work demonstrates that these two religious modalities are present within TSPM, with the more formal aspect featured in weekly Sunday sermons and the latter aspect more prominent in small prayer meetings among church adherents throughout the week. The latter aspect is defined in terms of ling’en 灵恩. Composed of the characters meaning “spirit” and “grace,” this term is the same as that used in “charismatic” or “Pentecostal” movements. However, its adherents understand it as referring to distinct forms of practices unaffiliated with those movements. In brief, ling’en refers to being filled with (or moved by) the Holy Spirit as a result of prayer. It is defined in sensorial and aesthetic terms and is associated with feelings of joy and peace that can easily move a person to tears. The gifts given by the Holy Spirit can also include the ability to exorcize demons, heal the sick, utter prophetic words, and speak in tongues. Although not possessed uniformly by church leaders, ling’en qualities are an important measure of authority within TSPM-affiliated congregations. The atmosphere of the prayer meetings that are the frequent site of ling’en experiences form a strong contrast to the staid atmosphere of Sunday worship services and may be considered a more personal and sensorially rich form of worship than the “public face” of TSPM-affiliated churches presented in Sunday services. Nevertheless, participants emphasize that such prayer meetings are “warm” rather than “hot” (renao 热闹), as the term renao is thought to be associated with activities that are “of the world” rather than “of God,” and, in some cases, even with evil spirits. 

Protestantism is one of China’s fastest growing religious movements and the complex array of interactions between the leaders and participants of TSPM-affiliated churches and the state has many potential implications in Chinese society, especially in relation to issues of state-religion interaction, as well as the role of the law in state actions.",1950,2021,1132,708,Mark McLeister,6,Matthew Hamm,2021-10-29 18:46:14.645 +0200,2022-10-27 20:59:42.578 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.1260666023517078,0.0026586257021786845,0.7355090202515056,0.13556990717930117,0.00019584451530677124,2.5014109832965167e-33
1231,"Shenxiao 神霄 (""Divine Empyrean"") Daoism",43,Religious Group (v6),"This entry follows the approach of the scholar, David Mozina by addressing Shenxiao Daoism from two angles: a 12th century textual lineage and a contemporary practice in Hunan that identifies with that lineage. It does so in the hope of illuminating aspects of both lineages. However, it is important to emphasize that this does not imply direct historical continuity, but simply highlights apparently similar threads within Daoism’s religious history. To further clarify these two angles, each comment is contextualized with a note regarding time period and three different time ranges are used: 1117-1127 for the initial florescence of Shenxiao in the Song dynasty, 1990-2022 for contemporary ritual practices, and 1117-2022 for answers that pertain to both time periods or to works of the textual lineage that persisted for centuries. It should be noted that the 1990-2022 time-frame corresponds to the period of ritual revival in Hunan following the Cultural Revolution, though the practices in question may date to as early as the mid-18th century.// Shenxiao 神霄 (""Divine Empyrean"") Daoism is a branch of Daoism that emerged suddenly in the early part of the 12th century in the Northern Song dynasty during the reign of Emperor Huizong 徽宗 (1100-1118 CE). The emperor himself is often revered as the founder of Shenxiao.// Shenxiao’s emergence was part of the rise of Thunder Rites (leifa 雷法), Daoist rituals that began to appear in the tenth century and that relied on Thunder Deities (leishen 雷神) to accomplish various goals such as rain-making and exorcism. It is these Thunder Rites that are still practiced in Hunan province.// A key feature of the Shenxiao cosmology is that, although it envisions a bureaucratic cosmos similar to other Daoist lineages, it places great emphasis on the oaths that deities make with one another and with human ritualists. This emphasis on cooperation as opposed to simply bureaucratic hierarchy suggests a greater sense of the subjective agency of both deities and humans than other branches of Daoism. This emphasis extends to the practice of Thunder Rites wherein Shenxiao practitioners make oaths with Thunder Deities and cultivate the primordial qi of their “spirits” (shen 神) through Inner Alchemy in order to establish equitable partnerships with the Thunder Deities that empower their rituals. //The court ritual master, Lin Lingsu, is credited with the innovation of synthesizing inner alchemical techniques (neidan) with the exorcistic power of Thunder Deities. In 1115, Huizong appointed the ritual master, Lin Lingsu as the court's highest-ranking Daoist. Lin Lingsu won this position by claiming that there was a 9th layer of the heavens (the Divine Empyrean) that was inhabited by deities superior to those of the other layers (which were understood as the sources of the teachings of other Daoist schools). Lin Lingsu further claimed that Huizong was the incarnation of the highest Shenxiao deity, the True King Jade Clarity, Great Emperor of Eternal Life (yuqing zhenwang changsheng dadi 神霄玉清真王長生大帝) who had taken earthly form in order to bring the Dao to all parts of the world. Lin Lingsu further claimed that a number of other court personages and intimates of Huizong were also reincarnations of Shenxiao deities and that he, Lin Lingsu, was the incarnation of a celestial officer tasked with propagating Shenxiao rituals and texts.// Although Lin Lingsu eventually fell from favour, Huizong created a network of Shenxiao temples (the Divine Empyrean Palace network) and declared himself True Lord of the Dao. He thus seems to have fully intended that Shenxiao become the imperial school of Daoism and a crucial part of his theocratic reign. This network was abolished after Huizong’s reign in 1127 but Shenxiao continued to flourish well into the Ming dynasty, particularly through the work of prominent theorists such as the patriarchs of the Southern School, Wang Wenqing 王文卿 (1093–1153) and Bai Yuchan 白玉蟾 (fl. 1194–1229?). While aspects of Shenxiao ritual continued to be patronized by imperial favour during the Ming, its identity as a distinct tradition both inside and outside the court had already combined with other lineage forms. Although Shenxiao eventually faded as a distinct school, its influence and ideas have continued to the present-day, including in exorcistic ritual traditions, as well as in the rituals of practicing Daoist ritualists in contemporary Hunan province, as documented by David Mozina and other, ongoing research in the region.",1100,2021,1248,708,Matthew Hamm,6,Matthew Hamm,2021-11-03 20:32:30.180 +0100,2022-09-23 20:50:24.048 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.20775740632024195,0.2107539351294757,0.2089550394058464,0.12635248024460444,0.1626505677610244,0.08353057113880716
1234,Ashanti,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Ashanti are an Akan people and have historically lived in south-central Ghana. This entry focuses on the Ashanti living in Kumasi state around the time of 1900, and largely relies on information from the principal ethnographic authority Robert Rattray (1923, 1927, 1929). At this time the basic social unit was the family group (localized matrilineage); various family groups came together under the head of one particular family to form territorial divisions or clans. Additionally, each individual belonged to one of two patrilineal exogamous divisions related to the concept of notoro. Ntoro is one of the two great elements in every individual, with bogya (blood) the other. While ntoro is transmitted patrilineally, bogya is passed through the female line. The ntoro divisions inform practices such as taboo observances and ritual activity. Key features of Ashanti religion (at the time this entry focuses on) include various supernatural beings, ritual objects, practitioners, and ceremonies. The supreme high god is known as Nyame, God of the Sky, Supreme Being of the Universe. Nyame is generally viewed as far removed from the daily life of the Ashanti but delegates some powers to other beings. Additionally, lesser deities are known as abosom, and ancestral spirits are known as samanfo. Other minor spirits, powers of nature, and beings such as fairies (mmoatia) and forest monsters (sasabonsam) are present. Certain objects are of religious significance, including obosom and suman. An obosom is a non-human spirit’s resting place, a shrine, usually consisting of a brass pan or bowl containing objects. Human spirits (ancestral spirits) are believed to inhabit objects as well, namely blackened stools. These stools were anointed during ceremonies and received offerings and sacrifices. Suman is the term to describe objects such as charms, amulets, talismans, mascots, or fetishes, which are imbued with supernatural or magical powers. Specialized religious practitioners are known as okomfo (priests). These individuals experience contact with a deity, and subsequently, enter a period of training before becoming an official priest of that particular deity. A variety of rituals and ceremonies were practiced, many of which centered around the propitiation of specific deities or ancestral spirits (such as formal clan leaders or royalty). Because religion was important to nearly all aspects of life, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with society itself.",1880,1910,1382,577,Emily Pitek,1,M.

1241,Taiping 太平 Movement,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Taiping Rebellion (1851-1864) was a Christian-inspired and cataclysmic millenarian uprising during the Qing dynasty that claimed the lives of between 20 to 40 million people. This entry takes a slightly broader view of the rebellion by examining the Taiping movement behind it from 1837 to 1866.// 
 
The Taiping movement can be said to have begun in 1837 when its founder, Hong Xiuquan 洪秀全 - a failed civil service examination candidate who belonged to the Hakka sub-ethnic minority in Guangdong - experienced a series of dreams in which he was taken to Heaven to meet the one true deity and emperor of China, the Heavenly Father. He was told that China had originally existed as a monotheistic utopia before Qinshi Huangdi and subsequent emperors had been seduced by Satan into worshipping heterodox traditions such as Buddhism and Daoism. The Heavenly Father further proclaimed Hong to be a ""Heavenly King"" (tianwang 天王) and charging him with restoring China to its utopian state as part of the transformation of the world into a new global order of Christian nations that would be united in their worship of the Heavenly Father and subordinate to China under Hong's rulership.//
 
Understanding himself as Jesus' younger brother, Hong began preaching his new message and was driven out of his village to Thistle Mountain in Guangxi. There he became the leader of a religious group called the God Worshippers. The majority of its members were of the Hakka sub-ethnic minority. Literally meaning ""guest people"" (kejia 客家), Hakka were Han Chinese people who had been pushed out of the north by invasion and faced frequent conflict with the earlier Han Chinese settlers of Guangdong and Guangxi, known as the Bendi 本地, who resented their intrusion and pushed them to marginal lands. Hakka people formed the core of the Taiping movement and many of their practices, such as monogamy, mutual dependence, and a resistance to foot-binding, became features of the Taiping movement as a whole.// 
 
Between 1848 and 1849, Hong Xiuquan was absent from the God Worshippers. During that time, several shamans and spirit mediums, most notably Yang Xiuqing 楊秀清, became prominent within the group and initiated practices in which Jesus and the Heavenly Father would descend into spirit mediums and perform miracles such as speaking in tongues or faith healing. Although hesitant to endorse these practices, Hong did so upon his return and Yang Xiuqing acquired a place of prominence within the group as the voice of God.// 
 
The descents of Jesus and the Heavenly Father also resulted in iconoclastic attacks by the God Worshippers on local temples and other religious sites on Thistle Mountain, which intensified tensions between the God Worshippers and Bendi militias, resulting in numerous battles. Alarmed by the God Worshippers' clashes with the Bendi, Hong's denouncement of corrupt officials, and the loyalty of the God Worshippers to a transcendent deity over the emperor, the Qing state attacked them as a rebel threat in the winter of 1850.// 
 
Shortly thereafter, at the beginning of 1851, Hong Xiuquan proclaimed the inauguration of the Heavenly Kingdom of Great Peace and Equality (Taiping Tianguo 太平天國) and launched an all out rebellion against the Qing. The God Worshippers, now better referred to as the Taipings, invaded the central Yangzi river valley and succeeded in capturing the former imperial capital of Nanjing in 1853.//
 
Hong proclaimed Nanjing to be the ""New Jerusalem"" and from it the Taiping movement created a theocratic state that, at its height in 1856, governed 30 million people. The Taipings were organized into specialty groups of 25 families that each provided a specific service for the state. Men and women, including spouses, lived separately and all property was held in common by the state through the institution of the Sacred Treasury. A particularly notable feature was the egalitarian treatment of men and women. Hong banned practices such as prostitution, concubinage, foot-binding, and widow suicide and insisted that women have equal access to the military, government service, education, and property ownership.//
 
Plans to reform the Taiping state into an even more utopian mode were cut short when, in 1856, Hong moved against Yang Xiuqing, who had come to refer to himself as ""holy"" and Hong as merely ""eminent."" Hong's attack on Yang Xiuqing resulted in the deaths of 20,000 people, ended the practice of mediumship, and fractured the Taiping movement, turning its commanders away from utopian visions and a united campaign against the Qing toward preserving their own regional power bases.//

Despite efforts by Hong Ren'gan 洪仁玕, appointed prime minister by Hong Xiuquan in 1859, to reform the Taiping state according to a Protestant vision Christian material civilization, Hong increasingly reverted to the Confucian style of government that he had previously renounced. As Hong increasingly withdrew from government affairs, Qing troops besieged Nanjing, cutting off its food supply and eventually taking the city in 1864. Hong died at the same time, possibly by suicide, and the rebellion was declared put down that same year. Imperial mop-up operations continued, however, until 1866.//
 
The Taiping movement's radical utopian vision and the devasting impact of its cataclysmic uprising left behind a complex legacy for late imperial and 20th-century China, foreshadowing and, in some instances, even helping to inspire the movements and uprisings of the 20th century.",1837,1866,1388,708,P.

1247,Exovedate,43,Religious Group (v6),"Exovedate was the term coined for a provisional government that attempted a Catholic state in the District of Saskatchewan by Louis Riel. Similar to movements that other scholars might call NRMs (new religious movements) and other 19th century sectarian movements, the group represented a new Catholic group that had separated from communion with Rome, part of a larger movement headed by Riel over the course of a decade. The group disbanded after a few months, but their actions have had a lasting impact on Canadian history and culture.

Heavily influenced by ultramontanism and millenarianism, the group believed that Louis Riel was a prophet of God, and that the Catholic Church, namely the Roman papacy, was in decline. The belief was that God would soon show a dramatic sign, signaling the moving of the papacy so that it may be restored in Canada by the French-Canadians and the Métis. The papacy would move from Rome to Mount Royal in Montreal, Lower Canada (modern-day Quebec). Ignace Bourget, Bishop of Montreal, was thought to be the rightful pope. It was prophecized that this papacy would also become corrupt over time, at which point the papacy would move to St. Vital in Manitoba, where it would stay. 

The Exovedate sought to bring back the Mosaic Law as the foundation of its legal code, redistribute the land claimed by the Canadian government to various immigrant groups, convert all Jewish people to Christianity, and protect humanity from the evils of 'liberalism.' They believed this was all a to be done as a prelude to the Second Advent, which was prophecized by Riel to occur in 4209C.E.

Group membership was known for certain to be a few dozen people, consisting of the government officials that made up the Exovedate and a few others close to Riel. The group died out after the North-West Rebellion in 1885, with the execution of its leader, Louis Riel.",1885,1885,1393,1066,Patrick Miller,52,Lauren Griffin,2021-12-06 01:15:04.555 +0100,2021-12-16 08:13:54.781 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.10289570404474999,0.0027358469064437934,0.7991461272260284,0.09521348226147294,8.839561304797324e-06,2.7515748570704356e-34
1248,Religion in the Old Assyrian Period,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Old Assyrian period refers to the earliest attested period of the city of Assur in the north of modern-day Iraq, later the cultural center of the regionally dominant Assyrian empire. In the opening centuries of the 2nd millennium, Assur was a single city-state ruled by a representative council, whose economic engine was long distance trade in tin and textiles to Anatolia (modern-day Turkey). The extreme profitability of the trade led several generations of Assyrian merchants to settle full-time in the Anatolian city of Kanesh, where they established a community referred to as the ""port"" with its own representative body to govern the local Assyrian community. 

The Old Assyrian pantheon was largely identical with that of the rest of Mesopotamia, with the exception of the chief god of the city. The city-god of Assur bore the same name as the city itself (modern scholars sometimes use ""Ashur"" for the god in order to distinguish the two, but the native writing was identical); for the Assyrians, Ashur was the chief god of the larger pantheon. The Ashur cult and its large temple environs were the center of polity life at Assur, which seems to have lacked a palace for most of the period. Second to the Ashur cult was that of the goddess Ishtar Assuritum, who also had a large temple complex at the city. Smaller temples of other important deities existed, and certainly myriad gods had shrines within the larger temple complexes. While naturally the Assyrian merchants did not have monumental temple complexes in their Anatolian host cities, the evidence makes clear that shrines to the many Assyrian gods were established at Kanesh and elsewhere, and some Assyrians served as priests in the ""port"". 

What we know of religion in the Old Assyrian period is heavily circumscribed by our evidence, which comes predominately from the massive textual and archaeological corpus left behind by the merchants at the site of ancient Kanesh, supplemented by some archaeological evidence from the hometown of Assur itself. Consequently, what is commonly called “Old Assyrian Religion” is above-all the lived religious experience of a group of one thousand or so individuals comprised of Assyrian merchants and their networks of relations. Furthermore, the great bulk of written evidence is from a 30-year window circa 1895-1865. Therefore, even though our window into “Old Assyrian Religion” is narrow and incomplete, it is near-unique for the ancient world in its intimacy.",-1972,-1718,1394,1070,Trey Nation,50,Andrew Danielson,2021-12-07 19:03:27.129 +0100,2022-03-03 15:25:28.769 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.7859169004128516,0.01695452408360379,4.7415526710445006e-11,0.1794984891640966,0.017630086292032547,4.639761832370303e-19
1251,Tsonga,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Tsonga are a group of Bantu-speaking people who have historically lived in what is now Mozambique and South Africa. This entry focuses on the Ronga sub-group around the time of 1895, and relies predominantly upon information recorded by the principal ethnographic authority (Junod, 1927ab). According to Junod (1927a), at the time this entry focuses on the Tsonga were composed of a number of clans, which formed six groups, including the Ronga. The primary social unit was the family and household. Several local households formed a village (led by a headman) and several villages formed a clan grouping (led by a chief). The central feature of Tsonga religion was ancestral spirits, known as shikwembu or ancestor-gods. Ancestor-gods were generally of two categories: those pertaining to the family and those pertaining to the country. The ancestor-gods of the chief’s lineage were those pertaining to the country. A formal priesthood was not present, but certain individuals (eldest male in a household/lineage) were responsible for leading religious activity and conducting ceremonies. The main feature of such ceremonies involved propitiation of the ancestor-gods through sacrifice and offerings. Other magico-religious practitioners included those who used magic for evil (baloyi), those who used magic for the good of the community (wizards), medicine men, and divination specialists.

1258,Religion in Judah,43,Religious Group (v6),"The population of ancient Judah had, as their supreme god, YHWH. The earliest texts did not use vowels. When later texts did adopt vowels, the name of YHWH was considered too holy to vocalize. Through a misunderstanding of scribal practices, modern scholars misread the name as Yehowah/Jehovah. Today, scholarlly reconstruction normalizes the name as Yahweh, though there remains some minor doubt as to its accuracy.
The people of Judah (Judahites, sometimes referred to as Judeans/Judaeans, though this better represents the region under later Roman occupation) were predominantly highland people who derived from the broader ethnic category of ""Canaanites."" Pastoralism and highland agriculture (vineyards, olive orchards, some grains, etc.) were the norm. Being situated in the southern Levant (eastern Mediterranean seaboard), Judah occupied an ancient crossroads and often felt the pull and dominance of Egypt and/or Mesopotamia. Judah, as a polity, only gained a firm identity during a period when those greater political centres had directed their attention elsewhere. The highlands also afforded Judah some measure of protection as well as isolation.
The official religion of Judah was centred on the capital city, Jerusalem, where there was the official temple dedicated to YHWH. As with other ancient temples, this temple was also a site for royal administration, and may have supported the local scribal culture. Priests oversaw offerings, including both animal and vegetative offerings, and prophets proclaimed their messages publicly. Festivals were most likely linked originally to the agricultural calendar, though later they became attached to the cultural memory of certain events in Judah's past. 
Two of the thorniest issues in evaluating Judah's religion are Judah's identity vis-à-vis Israel and the actual religion of Judahites obscured by the ancient sources, namely the Hebrew Bible/Tanakh/Old Testament (hereafter HB).
The HB presents Judah as having been part of Israel from its founding ancestors. Our earliest non-biblical sources, however, display two neighbouring kingdoms, Judah and Israel, with Israel being the more powerful. Modern historians often doubt that Judah had been part of Israel, but instead had later assumed Israel's identity when the kingdom of Israel was destroyed by the Assyrians in the late 8th century BCE. The HB comes to us via Judah, though undoubtedly some of the material originated in Israel. Therefore, it is difficult to disentangle Judah from Israel in reconstruction. Many of the religious aspects assigned to ""all Israel"" (including Judah in the HB) may not have been practiced in Judah. According to the HB, Israel and Judah had formed what is often called the ""United Monarchy"" under Saul, David, and then Solomon, with ""all Israel (including Judah)"" being ruled from Jerusalem. After Solomon (c. 930 BCE), the HB says that the kingdom of (all) Israel, split into two kingdoms: Israel in the north, with capitals that changed with dynastic changes, and Judah in the south, centred at Jerusalem and housing the dynastic line of David. Therefore, studies of Judah as a distinct identity is sometimes given dates as early as mid-11th century BCE if including the HB's ""all Israel,"" or beginning from c. 930 BCE, when the HB says Judah and Israel split. Others, relying primarily on archaeology, will begin meaningful discussion in the 9th century BCE when we begin to see more non-biblical attestations to the kingdom of Judah.
The second issue, regarding sanctioned religion, is also obscured by the HB. The texts we have are the largest source of information about Judah, but they were curated and edited heavily by scribes of a certain theological position. There is evidence of difference beneath the surface. Archaeology, even more so, shows a wide variety of religious practices either not described in the HB or condemned therein.

1259,"The LuWang School, the School of Lu Xiangshan and Wang Yangming",43,Religious Group (v6),"Lu-Wang Confucianism is a part of Neo-Confucianism from the Song dynasty (970-1279) and onward. The main protagonists were Lu Xiangshan 陸象山 (1139-1192) and Wang Yangming 王陽明 (1472-1529). They reacted against the view of Cheng Yi 程頤 (1033-1107) and Zhu Xi 朱熹 (1130-1200), who shaped the so-called Cheng-Zhu Confucianism, a position which would become recognized as orthodox. Lu-Wang Confucianism is also called ""The School of Mind/Heart"" (Xinxue 心學 Learning of the Heart) and Cheng-Zhu Confucianism the ""School of Principle"" (Lixue 理學 Learning of the Principle). However, they are not isolated from each other. They manifested rather two different approaches in an ongoing debate. Zhu Xi and Lu Xiangshan met and were corresponding on philosophical matters. Lu Xiangshan is accused by the Cheng-Zhu Confucians for being a Chan Buddhist. It is his emphasis on spontaneity, criticism of textual and ritual rigidity, which lays behind such criticism. Such discrepancy is however found within the Buddhist tradition as well and even within Chan Buddhism. Therefore, this criticism does not give justice to the Lu-Wang current.

1263,Judean/Yehudite Colony at Elephantine (Persian period),43,Religious Group (v6),"Standard encyclopedic introductions to a religious community generally begin with information on the group’s name, origins, and overview of its membership. This information, however, is highly debated among experts. Therefore, the current introduction begins with the points on which scholars are broadly in agreement. During the fifth century BCE, on the island of Elephantine (an island in the Nile near Aswan) officials of the Persian Empire oversaw a multi-ethnic /multi-cultural colony which centered on a military garrison patrolling the empire’s southern border. In the early twentieth century several Aramaic papyri connected to this garrison were presented to British amateur archeologists by local Egyptians. Since then, many more documents—papyri and ostraca— have been brought to light either on antiquities markets or through excavation. Most of these documents belong to the fifth century BCE (Van der Toorn, Becoming Diaspora Jews, 3-8).  
	The Aramaic documents from Elephantine which include official and personal correspondence, administrative documents, contracts, as well as a copy of the Words of Ahiqar and an Aramaic version of the Behistun inscription, shed light on a diverse community. Within the documents one can find individuals and groups described by a wide-range of gentilic adjectives as well as references to Egyptian, Persian, and Syro-Canaanite deities. Among those personal and group descriptors are a number of references to “yhwdyn” (singular “yhwdy”). Some documents refer to the “yhwdy garrison in Elephantine.” Among the deities, there are references to “YHW,” the deity of the biblical Israel and Judah described in the Hebrew Bible (there spelled YHWH). The documents even indicate that there was a temple to YHW. How to properly describe this group of yhwdyn who worship YHW at his temple is a matter of debate.
	With respect to the group’s name, scholars translate yhwdyn variously as Judean, Yehudites, and Jews reflecting their positions on the group’s origins, ethnicity in the ancient world, and when Judaism (or, more broadly, religion) emerges as a category. Concerning the question of the group’s origins, the documents from Elephantine only hint at potential answers. Scholars generally recognize that the group came from the Levant, but precisely where they came from in that region, when they came to upper Egypt, and under what conditions is a matter of conjecture. 
Regarding the religion of the community at Elephantine, scholars again are left to piece together the evidence. One highly fragmentary document, TAD A4.1 or ""the Passover Papyrus"" seems to be concerned with timing around a festival. Some scholars have connected this to the Feast of Unleavened Bread and Passover despite neither being mentioned in the papyrus. Other documents reference a temple to YHW and sacrifices offered there. Some of these documents are addressed to the governor of Yehud. This raises questions about the centralization of the cult of YHWH in Jerusalem. Documents from Elephantine also reveal that the priests of the Egyptian god Khnum with the support of a certain Persian official destroyed the temple to YHW calling into question the harmony between various groups at Elephantine.",-500,-399,1411,1025,Julianna Smith,50,Andrew Danielson,2022-01-05 17:22:03.800 +0100,2022-01-14 22:06:57.042 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.18693438756905012,0.1896305815952479,0.18801198480812756,0.18412905675966298,0.1667014995897231,0.08459248967818835
1268,Monotheistic Pre-Islamic South Arabia,43,Religious Group (v6),"This entry treats the state religion of Pre-Islamic South Arabia from the second half of the fourth century CE until the region was absorbed by the Sassanians in the seventh century CE. During this time, the ruling Himyarites not only expanded South Arabia to its largest territorial extent ever, spanning from modern Yemen to lower Iraq and perhaps even to Palestine (Robin, 2012), but they also adopted a new form of monotheism, which was heavily influenced by but distinct from Judaism. This Judaizing Himyarite Monotheism worshipped a monotheistic deity called either Raḥmānān “The Merciful” or ʾIlān “God.” While details about this religion are sparse, Philostorgius provides some hints concerning its character. He records that Constantius II sent an expedition to Himyarites (called “Homeritae”) in South Arabia in what would be the time of Thaʾrān Yuhanʿim (324-375 CE). He describes the Himyarites as “of the Israelitish family” but notes that they sacrificed to various native gods. There were also Jews in the royal court, who are said to unsuccessfully oppose the Christian embassy, as Philostorgius alleges that the Himyaritic king converted to Christianity and built three churches. Yet during that time, public state sponsorship of polytheism did not cease in the epigraphic record. It is not until the reign of Thaʾrān’s son, Malkīkarib Yuhaʾmin (375-400 CE; Robin, 2012), that worship in the monumental display texts was almost unilaterally directed to Raḥmānān, with mentions of the old gods becoming almost extinct (yet, they still persist in the less public stick inscriptions; Stein, 2009). Explicitly Jewish inscriptions also begin appearing in fourth century CE; albeit, the exact relationship of South Arabian Judaism with other outside contemporary Jewish groups remains unclear (Hughes, 2020a). There is further uncertainty as to whether their God, who is twice explicitly called “The Lord of the Jews,” was originally identified via syncretism with Raḥmānān or if he was thought to be a separate distinct but still monotheistic divinity, who existed alongside Raḥmānān (Gajda, 2017). Regardless of this potential distinction, the name Raḥmānān does eventually get absorbed into local Christian and Jewish vocabulary as a moniker for “God.” During the fifth century CE, the state continues to sponsor Himyarite Judaizing Monotheism all-the-while tensions between Christians and Jews begin to rise. The Martyrdom of Azqir (Conti-Rossini, 1910) records a priest named Azqir being arrested for proselytizing. He was then brought to trial before the Himyarite king (who is not said to be Jewish) and the Jews on his court. The text ends with Azqir’s martyrdom, with the narrator noting that thirty eight Christians had received a similar fate during that king’s reign. In the sixth century CE, state sponsorship of Judaizing Himyarite Monotheism disappears as the Ethiopian Aksumites gradually gained control of South Arabia and installed a Christian king, Maʿdīkarib Yaʿfur, on the South Arabian throne in 519 CE. Around this time, the Christians began to persecute the Jews. When Maʿdīkarib dies a few years later in 522 CE, a Jewish prince named Yūsuf Asʾar Yathʾar (Arabic Dhū Nuwās) began a series of military campaigns seeking to expel the Aksumites and to burn their churches (Robin, 2012). This culminated in the slaying of the Martyrs of Najrān in 523 CE, wherein the Jewish King Yūsuf gained control of Najrān by artifice and then systematically kills the Christians. This event gave justification for the Aksumite King Kaleb to invade South Arabia, during which he killed Yūsuf and violently seeks vengeance on the Jews. South Arabia thereafter would remain under Christian control until it was eventually acquired by the Sassanians.",360,570,1414,1010,Jason Weimar,50,Andrew Danielson,2022-01-17 21:41:21.189 +0100,2022-01-27 04:22:56.354 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.17517876060989812,0.17083567949446293,0.34843449370562285,0.24937797965232264,0.05617308653757571,1.1759130318546428e-13
1283,Butonese Muslims,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Butonese, also known as Orang Butung or Orang Butuni is a collective term that embraces diverse ethnic groups (such as the Tukang Besi, Muna* and Wolio) from the island of Buton and neighboring islands that constitute the Indonesian province of Sulawesi Tenggara (Southeast Sulawesi). The Butonese population (estimated at ~ 236,000) mostly professes Islam. Historically seafarers, the Butonese migrated from Johor (today's Malaysia) to the island of Buton and have subsequently immigrated to the Moluccas, the center of Indonesia's spice production in search of better economic opportunities. 

The Butonese Sultanate (founded ~ 1540), with the conversion of the Sixth Raja of Buton to Islam, occupied a strategic position in the coastal trade between Java and Makassar, on one hand and the Moluccas, on the other. The sovereignty of the Butonese Sultanate was challenged around the seventeenth century due to the power struggle between Makassar and Ternate for the control of the spice trade. By 1613, Butonese Sultan La Elangi liaised with the Dutch East India Company (VOC) to free the Sultanate from the power struggle between Makassar and Ternate. But by 1669, the Sultanate was placed under the suzerainty of Pax Neerlandica by principle although in practice, the principality was independent until 1906. Subsequent to Indonesian independence (1945) and the transfer of power to the Indonesian Republic (1949), Buton continued to remain a Sultanate until 1960 when the principality was merged into the Indonesian republic.

* Muna do not consider themselves Butonese although the  Muna-Buton languages belong to the Celebic sub-group of Austronesian family to which Wolio belongs. So, it would be safe to generalize that Butonese refers to the inhabitants of the former Sultanate of Buton (prior to 1960).",1500,2002,1431,1084,Vivek Neelakantan,37,William Noseworthy,2022-02-01 11:26:19.185 +0100,2022-02-13 06:55:49.373 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.14934897026232777,0.18263228995698727,7.956101213718023e-23,0.017531317711820347,0.5484149707304312,0.10207245133843328
1284,Religion of Phoenicia,43,Religious Group (v6),"The religion of Phoenicia was based on a polytheistic system. The high degree of political fragmentation of the city kingdoms of the Levantine coast implied that each center had its own pantheon, characterized by specific features although structurally similar to that adopted in other cities. Usually, at the top of this system was placed a couple of divinities, considered as polyadic entities, owners of the territory. Thus, for example, Byblos was dominated by the Baalat Gubal (literally the ""Lady of Byblos"") and by a local Baal (identified by the Greeks with Adonis), while in Sidon, at the head of the city religion, Eshmun and Astarte were worshipped; further south, in the rich and powerful Tyre, Astarte was once again conceived as protector of the city, this time next to Melqart, the ""King of the city"" (as the name openly states, from milk, ""king"", + qrt, ""city""). The polyadic gods were then joined, obviously, by other figures, each one - such as Baal Shamim, the ""Lord of the heavens"", Baal Hammon, ""the lord of the house chapel (?)"", or Shadrafa, the "" healing genius”- playing a specific role within the particular conception of the world, of nature and society, developed by the Phoenician culture. A direct and privileged relationship existed between the gods and the various city kings: the latter, who must and must still be ""just and righteous"", were emanations of divine power itself and had the task of maintaining balance between gods and men, ensuring the continuous communication between the divine and human spheres. Not surprisingly, one of the main roles of the sovereigns, who sometimes defined themselves as ""priests"", was to celebrate the divinities erecting or restoring their houses (the temples). Unfortunately, almost nothing of Phoenician mythology has been preserved so far. However, the Greek and Latin literary sources allow us to know some episodes and some themes, even if reread in the perspective of the sources themselves. Fundamental, for example, is the contribution of Philo of Byblos who wrote in Greek a ""Phoenician history"" in the second century AD (collecting the legacy of a mythical Phoenician priest, Sanchuniaton), some fragments of which have come to us thanks to the mediation of Bishop Eusebius of Caesarea (4th century AD). Philo's work includes tales of cosmogony and theogony, in which it is possible to recognize elements of original Phoenician beliefs.",-1200,-330,1432,1095,Giuseppe Garbati,50,Andrew Danielson,2022-02-01 12:00:20.894 +0100,2022-04-11 19:47:04.801 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.3189186435463514,0.35675867156510527,9.48039872208362e-12,0.05338813435795648,0.2383872892707531,0.032547261250353454

1295,Donatism,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Donatist controversy erupted in early fourth century Roman North Africa in the immediate aftermath of the Diocletianic persecution. The North African church was heir to the legacy of Cyprian of Carthage, whose belief that lapsed bishops were ineligible to administer the sacraments would prove crucial in the events that followed. During the Diocletianic persecution, a rift developed within the church over the status of bishops who had complied with the authorities and handed over their copies of the scriptures to be burned, an action referred to as traditio. In response to rumors that the newly-elected bishop of Carthage, a man named Caecilian, had been ordained by such a compromised bishop, a group of seventy bishops from Numidia denounced his ordination as illegitimate and elevated an alternate candidate to the Carthaginian bishopric. After their candidate was rejected at the councils of Rome in 313 and Arles in 314, the dissidents, called “Donatists” by their opponents after their charismatic second leader, Donatus of Carthage, were considered schismatic by the wider Christian church. 
Within Roman North Africa proper (modern Tunisia, Algeria, and parts of Morocco), congregations that viewed Donatus and his successors as the legitimate bishops of Carthage seem to have been in the majority throughout the fourth century. Failed repressions by the emperors Constantine in the 320s and Constans in the late 340s created a strong self-narrative among the dissidents that theirs was the church that “suffers persecution but does not cause it” (Gesta Carth. 3.258), though violent reprisals by Donatist partisans known as Circumcellions against their Caecilianist opponents tarnished this claim. Despite their “schismatic” status, Donatist writers were influential among Latin Christian communities outside of North Africa, especially the maverick theologian Tyconius, whose Book of Rules and Commentary on the Apocalypse dominated Western Christian approaches to exegesis and eschatology well into the Carolingian era. The Cyprianic position that schismatic bishops could not legitimately perform the sacraments led many Donatist communities to require converts from the rival church to be baptized upon entry, a practice their opponents decried as “rebaptism.”
The decline of the dissident communion can be attributed in large part to the efforts of Caecilianist opponents like Augustine of Hippo and Aurelius of Carthage in the 390s, which culminated in an imperial edict in 405 imposing heavy fines and confiscation of property on adherents. This edict was reified in 411 at an imperially-sanctioned debate between the two sides at Carthage. Donatism survived as a coherent movement long after the Vandal invasion of the 430s, and was last referenced as a contemporary phenomenon in the letters of Pope Gregory I late in the sixth century.",311,600,1446,1074,Jesse Hoover,49,Ian Randall,2022-02-14 07:59:24.131 +0100,2022-02-15 00:26:37.804 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.1270160288691816,0.0023418413938398534,0.5904910238653686,0.27979033737828274,0.0003607684933271626,7.459772548355925e-33

1307,Southern Baptists,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Southern Baptist Convention is an American Protestant Evangelical Christian Tradition formed in 1845. It is currently the largest Protestant denomination in the United States with a membership of 14 million adherents. It has historically emphasized evangelism, personal salvation, the authority of the Bible as the Word of God, and the autonomy of local churches.

The Southern Baptist Convention was originally formed in Augusta, GA in an effort to defend slavery (a view which has since been vehemently and retroactively condemned by the Southern Baptist Convention). In the 1980s, conservative Southern Baptists implement the “conservative resurgence” (alternatively called the conservative takeover by its detractors) in which they sought to return to a more traditional understanding of Christian beliefs and practices in response to a perceived drift towards mainline/liberal thinking. This resulted in liberal and moderate Baptists disassociating themselves and forming their own associations. Throughout their history, the Southern Baptist Convention have sought converts to Christianity domestically and abroad through missionary endeavors.  In 2010, Southern Baptists voted to be alternatively referred to as “Great Commission Baptists” due to their evangelistic emphasis and international presence. The most well-known Southern Baptist was Billy Graham (1918-2018) who was known for leading mass evangelism events around the world.

The Southern Baptist Convention describes itself as “a body of like-minded local churches cooperating together to reach the world with the Good News of Jesus Christ” (sbc.net). A central component of the Southern Baptist Convention’s mission is to “proclaim and minister the Gospel because the love of Christ compels us to do so. God’s call to us is to present the Gospel of Jesus to every person and to make disciples in every town, every city, every state, and every nation. The SBC is committed to sharing the Good News of Jesus Christ with the whole world” (sbc.net). 

The foundation for contemporary Southern Baptists beliefs is the depiction of the Bible as the Word of God, which is also seen as the authoritative source for Christian beliefs and practices. Southern Baptists have also constructed a summary of their beliefs in a document called “The Baptist Faith and Message”, which represents a broad perspective on 18 topics dealing with theological, ethical, and cultural issues. Southern Baptist churches are not required to affirm or adopt this document, but it does represent a perspective that is widely held among Southern Baptists.

1308,Jews and Jewish-Sympathizers in South Arabia,43,Religious Group (v6),"Between 275 and 300, the South Arabian kingdom of Ḥimyar managed to subjugate the nearby kingdoms of Saba’ and Ḥaḍramawt, and unified the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula. The language of the ancient and renowned kingdom of Sabaʾ was chosen as the official language of the kingdom. All inscriptions dated after the fourth century are classified as Ḥimyarite.  In order to further culturally unify their subjects, the king of Ḥimyar Malkīkarib Yuha’min (reigned from about 375 to 400) converted to monotheism around 380. According to the fifth-century Ecclesiastical History by Philostorgius (d. ca. 439), a Christian religious mission of Theophilus the Indian (d. 364) took place in South Arabia after the kingdom’s unification. However, we do not possess any source other than Philostorgius claiming that “Theophilus persuaded the king to become Christian” in the fourth century. Two religious communities are in South Arabia during the fourth and fifth centuries. The local Jews influenced the ruling elites, which adopted a cautious form of monotheism which could be defined as “Jewish sympathizing”. In some respects, the god invoked by the South Arabian kings and princes resembles the ‘High God’ venerated in the Graeco-Roman world and in buffer-state regions such as the already mentioned Palmyra. Ḥimyar’s becoming monotheistic was a more gradual process than previously thought, a conclusion supported by the religious vocabulary employed in the monumental epigraphic corpus. The Ḥimyarite monotheistic inscriptions of the time contain three different titles to indicate a supreme monotheistic deity. The most common ones are: ’ln (“God,” also spelled ’lhn, ’lh, or ’’lhn), B‘l/Mr’ S1myn (“Lord of the Heaven,” sometimes “of Earth” is added), and Rhṃ nn (“Merciful”). Although these theonyms possess blurred connotations, around ten Ḥimyarite inscriptions point to the presence of Jews in late antique South Arabia. Some inscriptions mention “the People of Israel” (s2‘bn Ys3r’l), the Jews (Hd/Hwd/Yhd) or the formula “Owner of the Sky God of Israel” (B‘(l) S1myn ’lh Ys3r[’l]). We also possess an edict granting the construction of a Jewish cemetery. There are many Hebrew and Aramiac loanwords in these Ḥimyarite inscriptions. In addition to two Hebrew inscriptions have been found in South Arabia, a group of epitaphs found outside South Arabia can be also attributed to Jewish Himryarite emigrants. The Ḥimyarite kings’ choice to adopt a monotheism inspired by Judaism potentially had political implications, distancing Ḥimyar from Rome, Aksūm, and the surrounding federations of Arabia.",275,530,1458,1109,Valentina A.

1309,Circumcellions,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Circumcellions (sometimes called Agonistici) are a subgroup of Donatists in northern Africa in the fourth and fifth centuries CE. In general, Donatists are remembered for their rigorous stance on Christian clergy's baptismal and ethical practices, particularly in the wake of persecution, in order for their ministry and sacraments to be deemed valid. Donatists, including Circumcellions were primarily active around Carthage and spread throughout the broader North African province of the Christianized Roman Empire. This group believed, in the wake of Diocletian's persecution of Christians, that those who denied Jesus's lordship or repudiated Christian scriptures by handing them over to Roman authorities had given up the ability to function as leaders within North African Christian communities.

Augustine, Optatus, and Filastrius of Brescia comment on the Circumcellions as a more radical branch of Donatist thought and practice emerging from Numidia that were characterized by their opponents as being rural hooligans, local mobs, and inciters of violence. They first appear in written record in the early fourth century in Numidia, and seemed to have been a more vocal subgroup within Donatist thought regarding the importance of changing the material circumstances of Christians. They particularly took violent action against traffickers of enslaved people and local landlords. They are often remembered (sometimes incorrectly or polemically) for seeking out martyrdom through violence, and for provoking soldiers, travelers, and courts to hasten their death -- all of which complicated late ancient Christian discussions of what types of martyrdom were acceptable. Unfortunately, much of what is known about the Circumcellions comes via the writings of those who saw them as a threat, so it is difficult to tease out what is rhetorical and what is historical reality about the group. Additionally, Circumcellions were primarily rural Donatist Christians who took aim at urban Catholic Christians, providing evidence that some Christian beliefs and practices were split along geographic and demographic lines. Because of their rural center, Circumcellions were remembered as comparable to bandits and highwaymen because of how they purportedly harassed urban travelers and soldiers across North Africa. By the seventh century, the Circumcellions' reputation spread such that their name was associated with non-North African clerics whose opponents wanted to label them as dangerous.",315,500,526,754,Chance Bonar,40,Stephen Christopher,2022-02-23 16:43:53.820 +0100,2022-03-09 03:04:20.711 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),2.030582777209658e-11,0.9926981633413299,2.394516926353488e-21,7.573055970620118e-11,0.0073018365626336835,6.717410072893243e-27
1311,Jehovah's Witnesses,43,Religious Group (v6),"The religious movement that would grow into the Jehovah’s Witnesses first coalesced in Pittsburgh in the 1870s around a young founder named Charles Taze Russell. Though previously disillusioned with religion, Russell was strongly influenced by Adventist ideas of Jesus’ imminent return. He began gathering friends and followers at a Bible Study and publishing a periodical called “Zion’s Watch Tower and Herald of Christ’s Presence.” By the 1880s, Russell’s congregations had proliferated, and he had formally founded the organization that would become the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, the guiding institution behind the Jehovah’s Witnesses. 

But the Jehovah’s Witnesses faced a prophetic challenge as a mounting number of revised dates that Russell continued to set for the apocalypse came and went without Christ’s tangible return. After another apparently failed prophecy in 1914, Witnesses began to argue that Jesus had indeed returned, but had done so invisibly, beginning a heavenly rule and ushering in the “last days” that will lead up to an imminent Battle of Armageddon. Soon, they believe, Jesus will purge the earth of sin and wickedness, creating a paradise. A small group of elite believers will rule over it with him, while the rest of the righteous will be reawakened to live eternally on the new earth. Nonbelievers will be punished with eternal death.

Because of their belief that the Apocalypse is imminent, Witnesses are hyper focused on proselytizing in their home communities and around the world. They do this through door-to-door outreach and by distributing literature in public places like train and subway stations. Through a tight organizational structure led by the Governing Body at a global level and elders at a congregational level, Jehovah’s Witness’ variations in practice, belief, and biblical interpretation are kept in check. Beyond their outreach efforts, Jehovah’s Witnesses are fairly insular, maintaining strong boundaries between insiders and outsiders. They are a relatively “high cost” religious group in terms of the demands they place on members’ time, energy, and autonomy. They also stand out from other Christian groups for their rejection of the trinity, as well as for their refusal to celebrate holidays, participate in politics or shows of patriotism, or receive blood transfusions. Over the last century, Jehovah’s Witnesses have often faced intense persecution around the globe.",1870,2022,1460,738,Joanna Smith,5,Courtney Fitzsimmons,2022-02-24 16:29:06.053 +0100,2022-05-02 16:47:28.348 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.08935634366057271,2.5869506839643454e-13,0.9105991088865474,1.560346853733885e-11,4.454743701758319e-05,5.7071275194686763e-33
1321,Mourides (Muridiyya),43,Religious Group (v6),"The Mouride tariqa (brotherhood) is headquartered in Ṭūbā, in north-central Senegal, the site of Amadu Bamba Mbaké's 1890s vision of the angel Gabriel and the location for the brotherhood’s Grand Magal, an annual pilgrimage that attracts as many as two million devotees. The brotherhood grew out of the Qādiriyya (Xaadir) tariqa, a Ṣūfī movement to which Bamba was himself an adherent. Three distinctive features mark the Mourides. First, their devotion to their order's founder, Amadu Bamba, mirrors the level of veneration often reserved by Muslims for the Prophet Muhammad. Second, their adherence to the principle of hard works makes them ideally suited for agrarian life in the Senegalese countryside. Third, their commitment to principled Islamic nonviolence, even during decades of resistance to French colonial overlords, has much to do with the emergence of Senegal as a nascent West African democracy in a region often beset by civil wars. Bamba's influence cannot be overstated. Mouride Wolof believe that by serving Bamba's vicegerents they participate in the blessing (baraka) of their founder and find a path to eternal life. A suborder of the Mourides, the Baye Fall, was initiated by a close disciple of Bamba’s, Ibrahima Fall, who continued his predecessor’s emphasis on the virtue of hard work. Other principles that are important to Mourides include mild asceticism, charity toward the order, filial devotion, Arabic and Islamic education, faith in the Hereafter, communal solidarity, the repetition of  God’s names (dhikr), and the Grand Magal, an annual pilgrimage to the holy city of Touba.",1853,2022,382,750,Tasi Perkins,43,Quinn Clark,2022-03-05 21:02:33.910 +0100,2022-05-19 18:56:40.556 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.9809032521658728,0.00108282663088145,4.601884549375201e-22,3.354558304678535e-11,0.01801392116970027,1.0967386224017885e-29
1322,Pagans under the Emperor Julian,43,Religious Group (v6),"Practitioners of traditional, indigenous, and non-Abrahamic religions and mystery cults under the Roman Empire, even during the brief reign of Julian (r. 361-363), were hardly a unified group, except in the mind of the emperor himself and his circle of intellectual elites. Although the term ""pagan"" originated as a Christian pejorative for non-Christian gentiles, it is more adequate than either ""polytheist,"" which excludes non-Abrahamic monotheists, or ""traditionalist,"" which erases groups that are relatively more recent than the familial and state cults of, for instance, Athens or Rome, i.e. Mithraists and Manichaeans. Individuals’ participation in religious practices, moreover, is not always consistent with inner convictions that are usually impossible to discern. 

Julian's religious beliefs and policies, nevertheless, attempted to integrate the rich diversity of Roman pagans into a single, artificial category in contradistinction to Christianity, which he regarded as an anti-religion, tantamount to atheism, that worshiped corpses rather than gods. Julian saw legitimate religions, Judaism included, as necessarily tied to ethnicity and geography. The ""ethnic god"" of each polis or ethnos accounted for their essential characteristics, e.g. the Romans were descended from Mars and so were warlike, while the Athenians inherited their philosophical tendencies from Athena. Julian called the Christians by the demonym ""Galileans"" in order to deny the religion's universality and restrict it to the ethnos of Jesus. As pontifex maximus and Hellenic Neoplatonist, the emperor not only treated Roman culture and religion as “from beginning to end, Greek;” he also placed all cults throughout the empire under his purview in a syncretic and henotheistic manner: every ethnic god was an emanation of the supreme god, which the emperor identified with the sun-god Helios. Basing his theology on the Neoplatonism of the Syrian Iamblichus of Chalcis, Julian’s Helios manifested itself in a triune hierarchy: at the top was Helios the King of All (pambasileus), which is “beyond being,” source of all being, and equal to the Plato’s Form of the Good and the One of Plotinus; King Helios (basileus) occupies the middle rank, the father of the gods and creator of the cosmos identified with Zeus and Plato’s Demiurge; lowest is the visible Sun, the conduit of Helios’ blessings upon the sensible cosmos. Julian and his inner circle also drew from Iamblichus the conviction that contact and spiritual union with Helios and the other gods cannot be achieved through intellectual contemplation (theoria) alone; divine blessings must be secured suprarationally through ritual practices such as prayer and blood sacrifice, while mystical ascent can be achieved only through the “hieratic art” of theurgy, in which the celebrant made suitable through purification participates in the “god-work” (theourgia) that sustains and renews the cosmos. In Julian’s quasi-ecclesiastical vision of ecumenical paganism, theurgists functioned as high priests over provincial congregations of local cults, and organized philanthropic relief of the poor and sick in competition with Christian charity. 

Although generally supportive of the emperor’s program of temple reconstruction, religious toleration, and redirection of imperial subsidies back to traditional cults, very few of the empire’s pagans shared their emperor’s radical vision. While the Iamblichean school of theurgic Neoplatonism persisted into the sixth century among pagan elites such as Proclus and Damascius at the Athenian Academy, in Julian’s day it was represented by a minority of philosophers. Even the majority of Neoplatonists were heirs more to Plotinus and Porphyry, who valued rational contemplation above ritual practice, and especially rejected blood offerings. Likewise, animal sacrifice had already been falling out of fashion by the fourth century, such that toothless prohibitions by Christian emperors such as Constantius II caused little trouble and did not extend to offerings of incense or cakes.

On a political level, Julian’s ideological polarization of Christianity versus a united front of paganism rarely corresponded to reality. While the Altar of Victory that Constantius had removed from the Curia was restored under Julian, the largely traditionalist Roman Senate had not supported Julian’s revolt against Constantius, while the army’s initial choice of Julian’s coreligionist Salutius to succeed the dead emperor in 363, which Salutius refused such that the Christian Jovian was elevated instead, suggests that an emperor’s personal religious affiliation was not so high a priority. It is telling of general attitudes at the time that the pagan soldier turned historian who served in that fateful Persian campaign, Ammianus Marcellinus, praised Julian highly for his military and political virtues, but largely criticized his zealous religious policies, such as his extravagant slaughter of sacrificial animals and edict forbidding Christians from serving as public school teachers. Although Julian did not violently persecute Christians, he nevertheless resembled the likes of Decius and Diocletian in that his divisive rhetoric of militant paganism largely clashed with the tolerant attitudes of the vast majority of the empire’s citizens, to a similar degree as the fulminations of Christian bishops such as Ambrose and John Chrysostom did not reflect the feelings of most Christians toward their pagan compatriots. The lynching of one such bishop in Alexandria, George of Cappadocia, by a pagan mob inspired by Julian’s accession in 361, should therefore not testify to pagans’ general attitudes towards Christians during his reign. 

In sum, the brevity of Julian’s 18-month career as sole Augustus precluded any potential success, and thus had little effect on the continuity or discontinuity of traditional practices in communities and households, which were largely maintained as a matter of civic pride and duty to ancestors. The pace of conversion to Christianity accelerated as much for its social and political opportunities as the religion of the new establishment as for its promises of spiritual reward on earth and in heaven.",361,363,132,1055,Jeremy Swist,49,Ian Randall,2022-03-07 19:33:08.468 +0100,2022-03-07 19:35:44.812 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),1.7449775540639497e-17,1.320829413850225e-30,7.350946102668552e-84,3.719607601781742e-59,0.9999999999988827,1.1173162377588958e-12
1323,Luguru,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Luguru (preferred name “Waluguru”) reside in the Uluguru Mountains in what is now the United Republic of Tanzania. This entry focuses on the Luguru around the time of 1925, during which time control of the region was transitioning from the recently dissolved German Empire to the United Kingdom. One of the main sources of information for this entry (Scheerder and Tastevin, 1950) is written in French, and while English translations are provided for some specific quotes, the work in its entirety remains untranslated. French to English translations were obtained through Google Translate and reviewed by a native French speaker. At the time focus of this entry, the Luguru were organized into 50 exogamous and matrilineal clans that lived in densely populated villages. These matrilineages played an important part in the traditional Luguru religion: lineage leaders could also perform the tasks of religious leaders, and lineage ancestors were considered sacred and propitiated. In addition to lineage leaders, the Luguru recognized other religious leaders including rainmakers and diviners, who were in charge of ceremonies and the propitiation of supernatural beings. The Luguru believed in both a supreme high god (mulungu) and ancestral spirits although most religious practices were devoted to the latter. For example, during naming ceremonies, one could take the name of a lineage ancestor, thereby inviting the spirit into their body. The more names one had, the more prestige they held, and could take on special tasks such as communicating with ancestral spirits. For the Luguru, religious beliefs were inseparable from almost all aspects of social and political life. Therefore, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society at large.",1910,1935,1470,1090,Anj Droe,1,M.

1333,Cult of Thecla,43,Religious Group (v6),"The cult of Thecla was a widespread and popular devotion to Saint Thecla, reportedly a follower of Paul the Apostle. The foundational text of this report is the Acts of (Paul and) Thecla, a second century Greek story about the young virgin Thecla who renounces her betrothed in order to live a life of sexual abstinence. As the story goes, Thecla survived multiple attempts by the local authorities of public execution, making her a model of eventual martyrdom ideologies. Though some Christians thought the tale a forgery (notably Tertullian), in the third to seventh centuries devotion of Thecla spread across the Mediterranean, rivaling devotion to Mary the mother of Jesus. From Syria to Africa, Greece, and Spain, reverence to Thecla consisted of shrines, catacombs, churches and pilgrimages dedicated to her. While reverence to Thecla as a saint continues today, late antiquity was the high point of such adherence.

The types of people who participated in the cult of Thecla varied dramatically. Evagrius Scholasticus of the sixth century, for instance, records in his Ecclesiastical History that the fifth century emperor Zeno had a vision of Thecla, who encouraged him to march on Byzantium to reclaim his throne, which he did. Afterwards, Zeno had a church built to Thecla in Seleucia, home of a center of Theclan cultic activity. One of the functions of shrines, however, was to provide shelter to pilgrims, who both gave offerings and received sustenance. This cultic economy necessitates involvement from both those wealthy and powerful enough to act as benefactors to the cult (such as in the construction of the shrines themselves) and those of the (majority) poor who sought out the shrines to pay homage to the saint, hoping to receive blessings in return. As described by the fourth century pilgrim Egeria, the cult complex in Seleucia had “innumerable monastic cells of men and of women,” with a head deaconess overseeing the virgins housed there.

Personal piety was also a major factor of the cult, which can be difficult to track for the majority of people. Items such as flasks or combs with engravings of Thecla are abundant, along with paintings and reliefs of scenes from the Acts of (Paul and) Thecla, as most notably evident in the Catacomb of Thecla (Rome) and the chapel at El Bagawat (Egypt). Famous Christians such as Gregory of Nyssa and Gregory of Nazianzus extolled Thecla as a moral exemplar, the latter even temporarily relocating to the shrine in Seleucia. This reverence reflected the concern for the body in some Christian circles, emphasizing the imperative of sexual purity, if not outright abstinence. It is implausible to imagine these kinds of moral ideologies belonged to the elite (for which have the most evidence) alone. Given Tertullian’s early negative disposition against the Acts of Thecla for the baptismal authority it seemed to grant women, it is no surprise that women in particular found power in the character of Thecla who defied the men of her life (even Paul!) to live an exemplary (chaste) Christian life.",150,600,1487,722,Ryan Fitzgerald,18,Robyn Walsh,2022-03-12 18:30:02.857 +0100,2022-05-11 18:30:25.993 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.48700109087306737,0.0018667342603531016,1.1667288385760926e-21,0.4403887309910927,0.07074344387548685,1.4986637643053225e-29
1334,No-debt Movement in US Evangelicalism,43,Religious Group (v6),"Financial crises and economic recessions over the past few decades have given rise to the no-debt movement in both religious and non-religious spaces. Many evangelicals in the United States, in particular, have embraced the no-debt movement that emphasizes debt elimination, financial stewardship, and generosity. Financial ministries such as Crown Financial Ministries and Dave Ramsey Solutions have become an integral part of the religious landscape as they provide resources, seminars, and curriculum to churches to help congregants get out of debt and generate wealth. The leaders of these ministries, in addition to pastors and church leaders, work to weave theology into financial practices to help adherents view debt through a theological lens. 

The no-debt movement is not only evangelical in its theology but also reflects American values and culture of freedom and agency. Although there has also been an increase of non-religious no-debt organizations and leaders who promote similar practices as evangelical no-debt leaders, the evangelical no-debt movement adds a theological lens into the American financial experience that provides adherents with new language and new practices. Debt is viewed as a form of slavery and adherents of the no-debt movement use various biblical texts to support their position. The only appropriate response to debt is to attack it until it is gone. This means that many people in the no-debt movement adjust their financial lifestyles in order to aggressively pay off debt. 

In addition to the aversion of debt, the evangelical no-debt movement promotes the concept of stewardship and generosity. Stewardship is the belief that God created everything and things like money, assets, and wealth belong to God, not the person. God entrusts people to manage assets like money and they are responsible for stewarding God’s money well. Excessive consumer debt is a sign that a person has not been a good steward of what God has given them and thus they need to make changes in their thinking and actions in order to get in line with God’s way of handling finances. Once a person is out of debt they are able to become more effective stewards of God’s provision because they can now be generous with what God has given them. Many adherents of the no-debt movement promote generosity as one of the ultimate goals of financial freedom. God give people money and wealth so they can steward it well and give it away to people in need.",1980,2022,1608,762,Nathan Womack,5,Courtney Fitzsimmons,2022-03-13 17:48:58.865 +0100,2022-07-14 01:06:05.092 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.05722106101119321,0.00034797271176552775,5.597313596273358e-12,0.9423786018892849,5.2364382158968576e-05,6.0391814150919745e-33
1335,Congregation of the Oratory,43,Religious Group (v6),"In 1575 a group of priests and men interested in religious life became the Congregation of the Oratory with the papal approval of Gregory XIII. In so doing they became one of many such groups of religious life founded in the Roman Catholic Church of the sixteenth century. Unlike many of these other orders, the Oratorians were not founded with a hierarchical structure enabled to organize a global order, but as a society of apostolic life. As such they were not bound to a central authority, but committed to a self-governing community. This presents a challenge for speaking about Oratorians as a group even in small chronological and geographic confines. Nevertheless, given that Oratorians drew inspiration from the original Roman Oratory inspired by Philip Neri, it is both critical and fundamental to understand Neri’s life and the Oratory he founded in sixteenth-century Rome in order to make any generalizations about the Congregation of the Oratory. Neri, born a Florentine in 1515 Neri spent most of his adult life in Rome after a conversion experience that drew him into the practice of religion. He spent many of his early years in Rome as a committed layperson until he was ordained in 1551. In those years he began a ministry that included engaging with people on the streets of Rome about religion. Rigorous asceticism, a commitment to learning about ancient Christianity, and a profound commitment to Catholic aesthetics through the visual and musical arts characterized his devotional life. Over time he developed a following from laypeople as well as ordained religious that became the Oratory, distinct from the congregation. Here, the Oratory refers to program of spiritual exercises that Neri orchestrated and led in Rome. At first spontaneity was the defining feature of these spiritual meetings, but over time these meetings became arranged in a more consistent format and included brief sermons, historical lessons, and hymns. Philip focused most of his attention on developing and sustaining these spiritual conferences rather than on the government of the group in Rome and the other Oratories it inspired. In this respect, it is fruitful to compare him with Saint Ignatius, the founder of the Society of Jesus. While both oriented their life’s work to the revitalization of Roman Catholicism, Ignatius exerted much of his emphasis in the governance of the Society he founded through his literary correspondence and perhaps more importantly by bequeathing his order with the Constitutions, which became the foundation for the Jesuit way of life. In contrast, the first Oratorian rule was only confirmed in 1612 by Paul V, seventeen years after Philip’s death. In some ways this reflects Neri’s reluctance to found a religious group at all. He preferred to encourage men to join other religious orders. Philip expected Oratorians to spend two hours at the oratory, preach or attend four sermons a day,   preach peripatetically throughout the city, attend matins, and visit hospitals. Oratorian work was not limited to these activities. He also encouraged members of the Oratory to take part in catechizing children, and give individual spiritual direction. He was personally famous for seeing people in direction throughout the day. In addition, he commissioned some of his followers to take on specific tasks that he deemed critical. Perhaps the most significant of these assignments for the greater intellectual world of Early Modern Catholicism, if not Early Modern Europe, was the project he envisioned for Cesar Baronius: a complete history of the Church that became the Annales ecclesiastici. This multi volume work prioritized Neri’s longstanding interest in Church History, which featured in both his personal devotional life and in the works of the Oratory. These efforts earned Neri and his Oratory a reputation for holiness and virtue, so much so that when Gregory XV raised Neri to sainthood alongside Teresa of Ávila, Ignatius Loyola, Francis Xavier, and Isidore the Farm Laborer, an aphorism echoed through the alleys of Rome saying: “we have canonized four Spaniards and one saint.” Neri’s reputation for holiness was enhanced by his supposed thaumaturgic powers and his status as a holy mystic taken to frequent ecstatic or rapturous experiences, many of which happened while Neri meditated before a work of sacred art or heard sacred music. Neri and the Oratorians were committed to the revitalization of Catholicism in its very heart, Rome. Their approach emphasized outreach to laypeople and pilgrims and highlighted many of the features that made Catholicism distinct, both a sensuous approach through preaching, music, arts, and architecture, and an emphasis on personal piety that emphasized intellectual stimulation and asceticism.",1575,1700,991,799,Thomas Santa Maria,40,Stephen Christopher,2022-03-14 23:43:30.467 +0100,2022-04-20 03:48:42.881 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.2091423390515698,0.006469973161999499,7.80209576107003e-12,0.7829686579524956,0.0014190298261329548,3.757746425360281e-31
1337,Tell Afis (Syria),43,Religious Group (v6),"Tell Afis is located in north-western inner Syria. The occupation of the site dates back to Late Neolithic and expanded in the Bronze Age, when the area was also exposed to Hittite political and cultural influence. The site, however, reached its peak in the Iron Age I-II, when the city became an Aramaean capital city named Hazrek (known as Hatarikka in the Assyrian sources and as Hadrach in the Bible). The ethnic components of the site population are difficult to identify, but probably included individuals of Aramaean, Luwian, and Phoenician origin.  Several massive buildings of a probably religious character arose on its acropolis, and  it is from this context that comes the Aramaic inscription of king Zakkur (ca. 790 BCE), now in the Louvre. Zakkur was a king of Hamath and Luath, whose homeland was possibly ‘Anah, on the middle Euphrates. In his inscription the king reports how the god Baalshamayn had saved him from the siege carried out by an enemy league led by the king of Damascus, Barhadad II. Zakkur may have been a supporter of the Assyrian power who refused to join the anti-Assyrian coalition. Although mainly concerned with the favour shown to him by the god Baalshamayn (divination is also hinted to), Zakkur's inscription appears to have been placed in the temple of the god Ilwer, who therefore is likely to be considered the main god of the town. Consequently, it is to his worship that the massive temple on the top of the Iron Age acropolis was probably dedicated. Although not much is known about Ilwer’s nature, he probably was a weather-god. Perhaps it was represented by a bronze statuette found during the excavations. The function of other buildings on the acropolis is debatable, but the acropolis seems to have been now reserved for ceremonial buildings. In 738 BC the town was conquered by the Assyrians and turned into a provincial centre, thus being intensely exposed to Assyrian cultural influence: findings from the site might point to a spread of the worship of the god Sin. Dog depositions seem to anticipate a phenomenon which reached its peak on the Levantine coast in the Persian age, a period which in Tell Afis is scarcely attested.",-1200,-600,1488,1041,Giuseppe Minunno,50,Andrew Danielson,2022-03-16 16:23:40.623 +0100,2022-05-31 18:04:34.224 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),6.868525230565937e-08,1.431742670020205e-20,4.313610579821595e-84,1.8714505307788682e-50,0.023359942326381042,0.9766399889883666
1341,Muslim Students Association of the United States and Canada,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Muslim Students Association of the United States and Canada (popularly known as MSA) is a network of Muslim communities that gather at and draw their support from college campuses. The history of the MSA dates back to the early sixties, a time period when Muslim migrants from the MENA (Middle East North Africa) region, South Asia, and Far East Asia migrated in large numbers to the United States in pursuit of graduate training in STEM fields and humanities. The earliest conventions of the MSA were held on college campuses in the Midwest region, including the University of Illinois campus in Champaign-Urbana. While majority of the MSA presidents were male graduate students, their wives played an even greater role in the growth of the Muslim Students Association by establishing the Women’s Committee of the Muslim Students Association. One of the key ritual practices of the Muslim Students Association is the Quran Study Circle. It had been organized on college campuses such as Karachi University, Pakistan long before the pioneers of the Muslim Students Association migrated to the United States. Through discussing commentaries on the Quran collectively, students sought to upend the separation of religion from higher education that had been brought forth by colonization and elevate Islam as a methodological hook for an integrative model of learning. In the United States, the Quran Study Circle addressed the shared concerns of women around childrearing. Its participants were the pioneers of the Women’s Committee of the MSA. They gathered at each other’s homes and leveraged the Quran as a prompt for discussing shared experience of parenting and raising young Muslim children in suburban and ex-urban landscapes where there had been no existing institutional presence of Islam. These conversations inspired the growth of the North American Islamic School Movement. Examples include Al-Fatih Academy, a K-8th grade Islamic School that offers an integrative model of education with hopes of helping its student body learn to cognize their emotions. In addition to the development of Islamic schools, the Muslim Students Association also gave birth to the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA). Located in Plainfield, Indiana, ISNA seeks to elevate Islam and uplift Muslim-American communities through interfaith dialogue and civic engagement. One of the enduring hallmarks of the Muslim Students Association has been a distinctively feminine approach to activism centered around building relationships and cultivating emotional connection across religious, national, and racial lines of difference.

1344,Tibetan Nonsectarianism (ris med),43,Religious Group (v6),"Tibetan nonsectarianism (ris med) describes a religious orientation in which the various philosophical and practice lineages of Tibetan Buddhism are understood as uniformly efficacious rather than as mutually exclusive competitors. Although many Tibetan Buddhists throughout history have adopted such an orientation, the concept was theorized most sophisticatedly in Kham and Amdo from the mid-nineteenth to early twentieth centuries, a period notorious for its political upheaval. Scholars have generally cited Jamgon Kongtrul Lodro Thaye Yonten Gyatso (‘Jam mgon Kong sprul Blo gros Mthaʽ yas Rgya mtsho, 1813-1899), Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo (‘Jam dbyangs Mkhyen brtse’i Dbang po, 1820-1892), and Orgyen Chokgyur Lingpa (O rgyan Mchog gyur Gling pa, 1829-1870), as three of the most important proponents of nonsectarianism as a self-consciously distinct, rather than implicit, orientation. All three were in close contact with one another and devoted their lives to reviving and preserving Tibetan Buddhist practices and teachings they feared were on the cusp of extinction, either due to active political suppression or popular indifference. The nonsectarian approached proved especially important in the late twentieth-century for Tibetan Buddhist teachers who had been forced into exile and sought to articulate a quasi-unified Tibetan Buddhist tradition that would be intelligible to the international world, and nonsectarianism has found a prominent place in the writings of modern luminaries as diverse as Kalu Rinpoche (Kar lu Rin po che, 1905-1989), Chogyam Trungpa (Chos rgyam Drung pa, 1939-1987), and the present Dalai Lama (Bstan ʼdzin Rgya mtsho, 1935-present).

There is not widespread agreement, either among scholars or Tibetan Buddhist teachers, about the precise use of nonsectarianism in the writings of the teachers mentioned above or in contemporary discourse. Indeed, the category is just as broad as “pluralism” or “ecumenicism.” Jamgon Kongtrul was primarily concerned with the “eight chariots of accomplishment” (sgrub brgyud shing rta chen po brgyad) while contemporary teachers are more likely to emphasize the nonsectarian orientation with respect to the Nyingma, Kagyu, Gelug, and Sakya schools. Some argue that nonsectarianism is inclusivist, and was used by teachers of Kham and Amdo to subtly assert the superiority of their own local practices, while others believe nonsectarianism should be genuinely pluralistic, wherein the Tibetan Buddhist schools are treated as coequal. Some argue that nonsectarianism implies that a Tibetan Buddhist practitioner can draw on whichever practices would be useful to them individually, while others argue that one should follow exclusively a single lineage in one’s own practice while respecting all others. These different readings have unsurprisingly yielded many different translations of ris med into English, of which “nonsectarianism” is the most common, but “ecumenicism,” “universal,” “without bias,” “impartial,” “an ecumenical approach,” “eclecticism,” “nonpartisan,” and “nondiscrimination” have also been used. A further point of ambiguity is whether Tibetan nonsectarianism was exclusively an elite discourse in the nineteenth century, or if it included popular elements as well. Although Jamgon Kongtrul, Khyentse Wangpo, and Chokgyur Lingpa were all elite monastics, they sought to popularize practices that had henceforth been aimed primarily at fellow elite practitioners.",1840,1920,1497,803,Andrew Taylor,40,Stephen Christopher,2022-03-22 17:46:54.858 +0100,2022-04-12 15:43:06.423 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.20169056191084814,0.004223418917745138,4.707599062178569e-12,0.7308623912704928,0.06322362789620632,3.996463933667421e-29
1348,Disability-focused Christianity for Palestinians,43,Religious Group (v6),"This group includes the many Christian-based NGOs and parachurch ministries in Bethlehem that are providing services for people with disabilities. Most institutes employ Muslims as well as Christians but are Christian in name and practice. Most of the Christians, then, belong to recognized churches in addition to this group.

I conducted 12 months of ethnographic fieldwork with two NGOs in Bethlehem providing services for people with (primarily intellectual) disabilities (May 2021- May 2022). Most of the data in this article is based on my primary methods of participant observation and semi-structured interviews. Over this time I visited 12 different organizations and interviewed their staff. While each NGO is organizationally separate, they are unified by friendships of varying closeness (and some familiar ties), a shared purpose in improving the lives of people with disabilities in the region, and in some cases, the same people receiving services (some simultaneously and others at different times). Some of the staff have rotated between the organizations as well. 

Another feature that unifies this group is the relatively marginal support they receive from local churches. Most individuals are connected with the major denominations, regularly attending a Catholic, Orthodox, or Lutheran church, but a lot of support (emotional, financial, staffing) comes from international churches or non-church Palestinian institutions, like local universities. Collegiate special education programs provide regular and reliable volunteers for several of these organizations as students complete their practical training.

Something that distinguishes this group from other members of the same denominations is their understanding and practice of inter-faith dialogue. Along with other interfaith initiatives in the West Bank and Bethlehem in particular, these disability-related organizations demonstrate a high-level of collaboration, as will be detailed more in the qualitative notes of this entry.

While small numerically, this group is important to consider because of the disproportional impact it has on its community. See the primary source, “Mapping of Christian Organizations in Palestine: Social and Economic Impact” (George Akroush). As Bethlehem has developed and urbanized, it has become a hub of services for Palestinians, medical and otherwise. There are significantly fewer resources available for people living in the villages surrounding Bethlehem, and some will even come from the villages of Hebron and Ramallah to receive services. While growing, the organizations as a whole still struggle to provide all of the services needed.",2012,2022,1502,802,Kevin Vollrath,40,Stephen Christopher,2022-04-03 17:35:14.814 +0200,2022-11-23 11:22:59.468 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),2.3478584863241023e-24,3.207760542254572e-27,1.3010485460824284e-55,0.9940352172978537,0.005964782702146366,3.7496141974257975e-30
1349,The Dingxiang Wang Cult,43,Religious Group (v6),"Dingxiang Wang is a multifaceted deity from the area of Changsha, Hunan, China, who became an important object of Hunanese worship both within and beyond the province in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The earliest mention of this deity dates back to the Song, during which he was described as the city god (chenghuang) of Tanzhou. He first appeared with frequency in the Qing as a local deity, and then the city god (chenghuang) of Shanhua County, Hunan, which was centered in Changsha. Legends describe him variously as the spirit of an upright demon-quelling official, a flood-calming official, or a locust-eating official, all of whom sacrificed themselves for Changsha. In 1847, he is said to have emerged from the Xiang River and possessed the body of a water-seller, and then marched to the magistrate’s yamen and reported for duty as the city god. He thus took on the aspect of a scholar-official, and several accounts indicate that he advised many hopeful participants in the provincial examinations. In 1852, during the Taiping siege of Changsha, Dingxiang Wang was one of at least two deities (including Li Zhenren) whose images were brought to the top of the city walls in an attempt to repel the enemy. Dingxiang Wang was reported to have been effective: When he was turned towards the battlefield, enemy cannon-fire was repelled, and the Taiping soldiers scaling the walls were pushed into midair. His legends state that he manifested as a spectral general who paced the walls and could be seen in a pavilion atop the wall, planning and directing the battle. For this service, Dingxiang Wang received the official moniker “yongzhen.” Dingxiang Wang thus became closely associated with the Xiang Army (Hunan Army), a military force that emerged from Changsha-area social networks. Its leaders, including Zeng Guofang and Zuo Zongtang, then received visions and guidance from Dingxiang Wang during their campaigns across the Qing. Dingxiang Wang was known to Xiang Army soldiers not only as a healer, but as a protector, as they fought the Taiping, Nian, and northwestern Muslim rebels all the way to Kashgar in Xinjiang. His worshippers, including the army's leaders but particularly demobilized soldiers, left temples to him across China, where he began to take on other meanings. Dingxiang Wang manifested again in the Sino-French War (1884–1885), in which he protected the coast from foreign cannons, following which he received another title, ""fushun."" The two known images of him reflect the same combination of aspects: he appears as an upright Confucian scholar-official, but with a tiger skin over his shoulders, indicating military prowess. In Xinjiang, meanwhile, a distinct tradition emerged by the early 1890s—not long after the arrival of Hunanese settlers in 1877—in which the Dingxiang Wang legend was adapted to reflect soldiers' experiences in the borderland, while the deity himself was referred to as ""Fangshen."" The deity was now said to have been an exiled soldier who, earlier in the Qing, had bravely protected his fellows by diving into a flooded fortress, saving them but sacrificing himself. By the 1910s, he was considered the special city god of Han settlers in Xinjiang. At the same time, he appeared as the protector of Changsha and of Nanjing in the Warlord Era, while newspaper reports indicated that in the 1920s he manifested several times in Changsha in order to punish the wicked. Worship continued in the homeland only until the late 1930s, at which point he fell into obscurity. This was the occasion for the compilation of an important temple gazetteer in Nanjing, where one of his “temporary residences” (xinggong) was very active as a center of Hunanese life. He was still known in Xinjiang into the 1990s. The Dingxiang Wang cult thus defined a complex diasporic community.",1124,1991,1503,1140,Eric Schluessel,45,Matthew Hamm,2022-04-04 03:48:16.969 +0200,2022-04-04 19:33:53.755 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),8.270347074812889e-26,0.001238161074866167,2.8008106616170254e-69,1.0918705881380427e-36,0.03212608701637892,0.9666357519087548
1352,Śākadvīpīya Brāhmaṇas,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Śākadvīpīya (or Maga) Brāhmaṇas are a little known Brahmanical group mainly settled in Rājasthān and Bihār. According to the ancient texts, they are Hindu Sun worshippers but also include Buddhist, Jaina and Iranian features in their cult. In the Sāmba- and Bhaviṣya-purāṇa, the story of their legendary migration is told: Sāmba, Kr̥ṣṇa’s son, is hit by leprosy, and only the Sun god can heal him. For this reason, the Śākadvīpīya Brāhmaṇas, experts in Sun cult, are called from Iran to Northern India to worship the god and heal Sāmba’s sickness. Very interestingly, many Iranian elements are present both in the content and in the language of these Purāṇic passages, such as Iranian loanwords, ritual objects and customs.  
Over the centuries, the Śākadvīpīya presence is registered in India in epigraphic sources, in the peculiar Sun god iconography with Iranian traits, by the astrologer and astronomer Varāhamihira (6th century CE), travellers’, and three late poems, namely the Magavyakti, the Sāmvavijaya and the Khalavaktracapeṭika  (probably ca. 16th century), which record the family names and further legends on the Śākadvīpīyas. They must have been very famous in northern courts in some periods, especially in relation to Sun worship, and even the fact that their texts have been inserted in the Purāṇic literature testifies to their social importance; the same is valid for the later poems. 
Their cult is perfectly inserted in the syncretistic tendency that has characterized North Indian cults since the first centuries CE, when some groups living in the lands in between Iran and India moved to North India and established powerful reigns there. The Śākadvīpīyas may have followed the same route, settled in India, built their sacred places, and specialised in Sun cult. 
Nowadays, Śākadvīpīya communities are still present on Indian soil, in the same ancient areas of settlement. Śākadvīpīya priests are still versed in astrology and the main solar festivals are still celebrated by the community. Unfortunately, the new generations are generally not interested in their peculiar customs, and most of them are aware of belonging to a specific tradition only because of marriage endogamic policies. However, in the last years, small groups of Śākadvīpīya people have started again cultivating the interest in their traditions and rediscovered their ancient customs. To revitalise the community, new associations have been created and some magazines, like the Rājasthāni Brahmāṇḍ Cetnā, have been published on monthly basis.",2,21,1505,1119,Martina Palladino,24,Travis Chilcott,2022-04-06 13:29:57.239 +0200,2022-04-20 09:03:58.505 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),3.176913508936017e-25,0.00041889083623914574,6.02681906013224e-81,3.8695929404423447e-59,0.025001192973200963,0.9745799161905598
1357,Encratites,43,Religious Group (v6),"It’s a popular early Christian movement characterized by the defense of chastity, rejection of marriage and perhaps a refusal of meat and wine. However, it’s a poorly defined movement as there aren’t clear boundaries of where and when it took place and who were its adherents. 
The name comes from the Greek word egkrateia, which means restraint from one’s emotions and desires and self-control. This was considered a virtue in the Greco-Roman world, and examples of communities that abstained from sex and had strict diets are abundant already in pre-Christian communities. In Christian context, Encratism appears in second-century charges of heresists against Marcion, Saturninus and Tatian. But in addition to naming a heresy and identifying a specific group, encratism it is also understood as a general tendency of eschatological early Christian communities to refuse sex and sexuality. 
In the first scenario, we have the writings of Church Fathers, namely Irenaeus (185) and Clement of Alexandria (190), accusing Marcion and Saturninus of presenting marriage as corruption and Tatian of advancing these ideas. Irenaeus and Hippolytus (ca.225) also mention they abstain from eating living things (probably meat). Jerome (385) is the first Church Father to also add refusal of wine as an Encratite rule.
According to these Fathers, Encratic rules were based on theological formulations about salvation. Tatian would've posited that Adam and Eve created separation from the Holy Spirit through the original sin putting humans and animals on the same level. As a consequence, humans acquired animalistic characteristics such as mortality and sex drive. The vegetarian diet and chastity were intended to lessen these characteristics and bring humans close to their original purity and proximity with the Holy Spirit.
In the second scenario, it seems that from the second century throughout Late Antiquity, Christians from several sects adopted at least some form of continence or dietary restrictions. Whether Encratism was an actual movement or just a widespread practice is uncertain. Its interwoven with other movements is clear in the Edict of 382, for example. In the document, the Emperor Theodosius pronounces a death sentence to all that take the name of Encratites and affirms they are Manichaeans (another persecuted sect) in disguise.
In scholarship, encratism has been used interchangeably with early Christian asceticism. It has also been linked to the Gospel of Thomas, Gospel of the Egyptians, the Apocryphal Acts, particularly in relation to chaste women, and passages of the New Testament (Luke 2:36; Matt 1:24; I Tim 4:1-4).",100,400,1517,1136,Naiara Leão,49,Ian Randall,2022-04-07 20:35:50.838 +0200,2022-04-13 01:23:56.188 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),1.581428949856358e-35,1.0,1.3845762253624523e-25,8.478389004242486e-36,2.173648758828516e-17,1.4382882136636693e-17
1371,Twelver Shi'ism in post-revolutionary Iran,43,Religious Group (v6),"Twelver Shi’ism, also known as Ithna ‘Ashari, Twelvers or Imami Shi’a, is the main branch of Shi’a Islam and maintains the largest population of Shi’a Muslims worldwide. It has a population of around 200 million and constitutes the majority in Iran, Iraq, Bahrain, and Azerbaijan. What characterizes Twelver Shi’ism in terms of their fundamental beliefs is their view on the successorship of Muhammad, the Prophet of Islam. For them, Ali, Muhammad’s son-in-law and cousin, and eleven of Ali’s direct descendants, known as Imams, are the sole religious and political authorities after the Prophet. This belief further defines the way in which the religiopolitical identity of Twelver Shi’ism has been developed through the course of history.

Iran has the largest Twelver Shi’a population, estimated at approximately 76-80 million, i.e. 90-95% of today’s Iranian population. Twelver Shi’ism is the state religion of Iran since the 16th century, and its legal and theological doctrines are integrated into the country’s legal code and constitution. After the Iranian revolution of 1979, Iran’s constitution was significantly revised to better reflect the Twelvers’ ideology and legal thought. Specifically, the theory of Vilayat-e Mutlaqe-ie Faqih [the guardian jurist’s absolute authority] was incorporated into the Iranian legal system. According to this theory, strongly advocated by Ayatollah Khumayni, the founder and former leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the state’s major decisions must be supervised and confirmed by a Twelver Shi’a Mujtahid, a  scholar of the highest-ranking in Shi’a legal thought. Therefore, by the constitution, the head of the Iranian state today, i.e. its supreme leader, has to be a Twelver Shi’a Mujtahid, elected by the Council of Experts, a deliberative assembly of more than eighty other Twelver Shi’a Mujtahids.This suffices to show how religion and state are interconnected in Iran. Also, Twelver Shi’a ideology is deeply intertwined with various areas of Iranian culture, economy, education, etc. and its footprints can be observed all over the post-revolutionary Iranian public life. It also plays a significant role in defining Iran’s international diplomacy. For example, the Iran-Israel ongoing conflict is deeply rooted in the Twelvers’ religious ideology and the role of Iranian religious leadership in defining the state’s international relations. 

In sum, contemporary Iranian cultural, political, and social values are heavily influenced by Twelver Shi’ism ideology, legal thought, and worldview. For the purpose of this entry, our focus centers around documenting ideological, cultural, social, and political tenets that characterize Twelver Shi’ism in post-revolutionary Iran (1979-current).",1979,2022,1526,1117,Hasan Doagoo,43,Quinn Clark,2022-04-15 22:51:28.600 +0200,2022-04-27 22:25:13.959 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.10289570404474999,0.0027358469064437934,0.7991461272260284,0.09521348226147294,8.839561304797324e-06,2.7515748570704356e-34
1374,The Reformed Church (Early Orthodoxy),43,Religious Group (v6),"The period often identified as Reformed orthodoxy (alternatively, Reformed scholasticism) within the history of the Reformed church lasts from approximately 1560 until 1800. It is traditionally subdivided into three shorter periods: early orthodoxy (1560–1620), high orthodoxy (1620–1700), and late orthodoxy (1700–1800). Most historians fix the beginning of early orthodoxy to the transition from the second to the third generation of reformers, as Peter Martyr Vermigli (d. 1562), Wolfgang Musculus (d. 1563), John Calvin (d. 1564), and their second-generation peers were replaced by Theodore Beza, Zacharius Ursinus, Girolamo Zanchi, and others. It was a period of solidification for the Reformed tradition, witnessing the spread of confessional statements of faith—including the Gallic Confession (1559), Belgic Confession (1561), Second Helvetic Confession (1562), Heidelberg Catechism (1563), and eventually the Canons of Dort (1619)—which delineated the boundaries of the Reformed faith and reinforced its differences with other forms of Protestantism. The theology of the period is marked by a return to the scholastic method of the late medieval period and the rise of intra-Reformed disputes about particular theological doctrines (e.g., predestination), a trend which intensified throughout the first half of the seventeenth century as disputes turned increasingly to the minutiae of Reformed theology. The end of early orthodoxy has been located as early as 1620 (with the Canons of Dort serving as the approximate conclusion of the period in Willem van Asselt’s periodization) to as late as the 1640s (with the end of the Thirty Years’ War and the Westminster Assembly marking the transition in Richard Muller’s periodization).",1560,1620,1527,1122,Wesley Viner,40,Stephen Christopher,2022-04-17 15:18:28.828 +0200,2022-04-17 15:18:28.828 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.39387269098179467,0.0017661135345630615,6.544312045573728e-11,0.602003973099483,0.0023572223187162985,2.82321458728219e-32
1386,Liumen (Liu School),43,Religious Group (v6),"The Liumen 劉門 tradition evolved from the teachings of the Confucian scholar Liu Yuan 劉沅 (1768–1856; styles: Zhitang 止唐, Neru 訥如; alias: Qingyang 清陽, Huaixuan 槐軒), who combined his Confucian erudition with the practice of Daoist self-cultivation and eventually became one of the most influential personalities in late-imperial Sichuan, commonly known as Chuanxi fuzi 川西夫子 (Master of Western Sichuan). 
Those works among Liu’s numerous writings which are representative of his Confucian erudition have been published by his descendants and students as a posthumous collection under the title Huaixuan quanshu 槐軒全書 (Collected Works from the Locust Tree Studio or Collected Works of Huaixuan). 
The leadership of the Liumen community, which developed into a quasi-religious movement during the 19th century, was handed down within the Liu family. Many temples in Sichuan were managed by the community, and most of these centers also contained charitable institutions and schools. Possibly due to its Confucian credo, the Liumen movement was not considered a heterodox sect in late Qing and Republican times, and it flourished until the middle of the 20th century. 
Being one of the most influential scholarly and spiritual traditions of Sichuan at that time, the teachings of Liu Yuan and the Liumen doctrine spread throughout the province and beyond. As an important part of civil society, Liumen was active in education, charity, religion and other realms of social and cultural life. It had many local branches and developed its own Daoist ritual tradition named Fayan tan 法言壇 (Altar of Ritual Words). 
The establishment and development of the Fayan tan tradition constitutes an important aspect of Liumen's interaction with the Daoist religion. Liu Yuan and some of his disciples edited a whole canon of Daoist ritual texts, which was titled Fayan huizuan 法言會纂 (Compendium of Ritual Words). The rituals recorded in this compilation cover the full range of religious services offered to the society of late imperial China, comprising rites for the expulsion of diseases or vermin, for pacifying the spirits of earth, water, and fire as well as offering ceremonies to various divinities, exorcisms, and funerary rituals. Considerable space is reserved for rites for ancestors and desolate souls. Each chapter includes instructions and texts for a “classified ritual” (keyi 科儀), and these rituals are combined to form the liturgical festivals of the Liumen community. 
Local Daoist priests who were affiliated with the Liumen community and used the Fayan huizuan canon in their ritual activities eventually constituted an independent liturgical branch of non-monastic Daoism and venerated Liu Yuan and the following Liumen patriarchs as ancestral masters of their lineage. Priests of the Fayan tan tradition are still active today. Liu Yuan and his community thus actively contributed to the development of modern and contemporary Sichuanese Daoism by establishing the foundations of the Fayan tan tradition. The Fayan tan liturgy still plays a significant role in the religious practice of Sichuan that can be observed today, and it continues to reflect the ethical values of the Liumen tradition. 
While only minor groups of Liumen adherents and priests of the Fayan tan tradition are still active today, the intellectual and cultural heritage of Liumen is currently ""reinvented"" as ""Huaixuan culture"" 槐軒文化 or ""School of Huaixuan Thought"" 槐軒學派 in mainland China to adapt it to the needs of CCP rule, which prohibits any activities of independent popular (religious) communities.",1807,1950,1541,1085,Volker Olles,45,Matthew Hamm,2022-04-30 11:59:48.700 +0200,2022-05-31 04:18:07.415 +0200,Mapping Religious Diversity in Modern Sichuan,0.18645080701328834,0.00489096348825323,0.647121966644858,0.16148439340159518,5.1869452005307784e-05,1.9648854278186365e-22
1390,Eastern Apache,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Central Band of the Eastern Apache are a Native American group residing in what is now New Mexico. This entry focuses on ethnographic evidence that reconstructs Eastern Apache life and beliefs in 1870, prior to the reservation era, at which time the Eastern Apache occupied territory west of the Rio Grande in what is now southern Arizona and New Mexico. The second half of the 19th century was marked by violent conflict between the United States government and the Eastern Apache, which ended in 1886 with the surrender of the Eastern Apache chief, Geronimo, to United States forces. Following his surrender, the Eastern Apache people were considered prisoners of war and imprisoned first in Florida, then in Alabama, and lastly, in Oklahoma. The combination of violence, imprisonment, and forced migration resulted in severe population loss among the Eastern Apache. In 1913, most of the Eastern Apache were again transferred, this time to the Mescalero Reservation in New Mexico (Beierle, 2012:2). In 1870, the Eastern Apache lived in autonomous settlements that engaged in warlike raids of both external societies and other Eastern Apache communities. Eastern Apache religion centered around the personal relationship that each individual had with a supernatural, animating principle known as “the power.” Those with especially strong relationships with the power were known as shamans. Power was believed to come from different supernatural sources, including one of many supernatural beings, and could be used for multiple reasons, from curing to cursing people. For the Eastern Apache, religious beliefs were inseparable from almost all aspects of social and political life.

At its peak in the 14th century BCE, the Mittani Empire or state would have included at least Aššur, Alalaḫ, Arrapḫa, Kizzuwatna, Tunip, and probably Yamḫad and Ḫana. These were semi-independent, and sometimes ruled by their own Kings under the overlordship of Mittani with models of governance probably adapted on a case-by-case basis. 

This region has been difficult to access in recent times, which means that many potentially Mittani sites remain unexcavated and much about Mittani is still unknown. To complicate matters further, in the past data about Mittani and Assyria were often added together, and to date no large (royal) Mittani archive has been identified. A huge number of mostly economic documents is available from Nuzi, which was part of the Mittani vasal state of Arrapḫa – but it should not be assumed that any religious practices we can discern from these for Nuzi would reflect those of the entire Mittani Empire. There is only a handful of published cuneiform tablets that can be said with certainty to have been Mittani. The biggest source of information is perhaps the Mittani series of Amarna letters, and Mittani is also frequently mentioned in other contemporary letters and treaties, e.g. by the Assyrians and Hittites. Also significant are the so-called 'Assyro-Mittani' tablets found at Boğazköy, which describe witchcraft and rituals. It is usually unclear however who wrote these, when, and where – and as with Nuzi, it should not be assumed that the practices described in these texts would have consistently applied across the entire Mittani Empire.

While it is likely that the Mittani people would have primarily identified as Hurrian, not all Hurrians were Mittani. In addition, the Hurrians did not necessarily have homogenous theology, mythology, cults or rituals nor did they have a name for their religion – and as such should not be understood as a religious group. With that said – many people likely believed in a particular array of named deities, and held a related collection of beliefs with associated institutions and practices. For instance, Hurrian texts refer to an idea of heaven, earth and the underworld. The most significant Hurrian deity was the weather god Teššub. He would have yielded storm, rain, and lighting, and travelled the skies in a chariot drawn by bulls. He was joined by the goddess of love and war, Šauska, who would have played an important role e.g. blessing marriages. There were likely also a sun and mood god, Šimike and Kušuh, linked to different omens and oaths; and of course many deities, such as Nergal and Ea, borrowed from other traditions. Deities were anthropomorphic and they were given offerings. Rituals, festivals, divination and incantation all played important roles in society, and cities had temples dedicated to deities. Many more details are available about Hurrian religious beliefs, but not necessarily from Mittani sources or the Mittani period.",-1550,-1350,1554,1171,Zenobia Homan,50,Andrew Danielson,2022-05-23 13:07:24.235 +0200,2024-06-05 22:00:14.955 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.24878957438748414,0.23388268228741876,0.2763013452351172,0.172286158347477,0.06509574077210684,0.003644498970396125
1404,Religion in Nabataea,43,Religious Group (v6),"Religion in Nabataea was a confluence of native and foreign deities and practices which spread across the Arabian desert. Ranging from the worship of betyl blocks to figural sculpture, sacred high places to Greco-Roman temples, priestly worship in sacred places to traveling pocket-sized 'eye-idols,' religious practice adapted readily to the many needs of its people and the cultural heterogeneity which permeated the region. While the concept of a “Nabataean religion” is inauthentic, a general understanding of the polytheistic religious practice within the area controlled by the Nabataean king can be reconstructed from material evidence and the few remaining literary sources. Aniconic blocks are the most common aspect of Nabataean worship, in Petra and throughout the region. These rectangular blocks, sometimes including eye stones or engravings called ‘eye-idols,’ were often dedicated to the primary deities of Nabataean polytheism, specifically Dushara and al-Uzza. Ritual feasting was also an important aspect of religious tradition, as was common in other Near Eastern and Semitic religious groups. These feasts took place commonly in triclinia as part of sacrificial and funerary ceremonies. Sacrifices, perhaps of live animals, but more likely of clay figurines, were fundamental aspects of these ceremonies.

Egyptian, Persian, and Greco-Roman influences were clearly prominent in the art and architecture of main Nabataean cities, including figural depictions of deities which was unusual for the aniconic traditions of the Nabataeans. While foreign deities were often amalgamated with Nabataean deities, such as Dushara-Zeus-Dionysus and al-Uzza-Isis-Aphrodite Ourania, the syncretization remained largely in public urban spaces. In practice, religious traditions seem to have remained unchanged even with the on-going contact with foreigners. Few foreign influences have been found in private spaces, sacred high places, or rural areas. 

As Nabataeans spread into the Mediterranean, for political and economic purposes during the later part of the Hellenistic period, their worship of the high god Dushara traveled with them. Cultic sites and altars dedicated to Dushara have been found as far away as Puteoli, Italy. This is likely due to the strong connection between Nabataean kingship and Dushara. While the king played a role in religious practice, much still remains unknown about the roles of worshippers and the organization of religion in Nabataea due to the lack of written records by contemporary, Nabataean sources.",-300,450,1560,1188,Anna Accettola,50,Andrew Danielson,2022-05-28 18:47:59.563 +0200,2022-05-28 18:49:38.852 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.22803674492767007,0.23296510413000926,0.2362088258704059,0.14283250161968722,0.13310505678011145,0.026851766672116178

The Olmec developed regal-ritual centers with main plazas, pyramids, and public spaces near naturally sacred places (e.g., springs, water sources, caves) so that the general population could congregate for ceremonial religious rituals. The Olmec practiced shamanism and had an organized priesthood. The Olmec elite, shamans, and priests were at the top of the social hierarchy and were in charge of maintaining their religious and cultural traditions. There have been six Olmec supernatural beings or deities identified by Mesoamerican scholars, and while their names are not known, they have been numbered I through VI and associated with natural phenomena including: sky, fertility, rain, earth, agriculture and maize. We know a lot about Olmec religion thanks to their impressive and unique artistic traditions, as well as from later Mesoamerican religious traditions that borrowed Olmec concepts, ideology, and iconography and turned these into their own religious traditions, such as the Maya society.

1426,Early Missionary Christianity in China,43,Religious Group (v6),"Religious Group-Early Missionary Christianity in China

Speaking of Christianity in China, the early missionary period, compared with the later nineteenth century when both the Catholic and Protestant missionaries appeared, is usually defined as from the late sixteenth to the early eighteenth centuries. It was the time when the first most active Christian mission was developed in China. Then, during the European Reformation and overseas expansion, the Catholic missionary was the sole actor in evangelization financed both by the Church and states. The Society of Jesus was officially founded in 1540 and became a significant contributor to the China mission over the centuries. This religious order tied with Asia in the very beginning. Francis Xavier (1506-1552), the first generation of the Jesuits, embarked from Lisbon in 1541 under the auspice of the Portuguese court on behalf of the crown’s colony in India. Although Xavier only died on an island outside Macao, not yet set foot on Mainland China, the Padroado, the Portuguese royal supporting system of the Jesuit missionary, became the primary channel to initiate the Catholic missionary history in East Asia. The Italian Jesuit Matteo Ricci (1552-1610) was the most crucial figure in the inception of the Jesuit China mission, who arrived in Macao in 1582. Thenceforth until around 1724, when the Chinese Emperor officially prohibited the religion, this early missionary period of Christianity in China was well-known for its vigorous religious and cultural encounters and thought as the first and most fascinating cultural interaction between Europe and China. The Jesuit evangelization in Japan and China, starting with learning native languages and accommodating cultural elements to their preaching, was proposed by the Jesuit Visitor Alessandro Valignano (1539-1606). Ricci substantially realized this method of accommodation, to fully dress as a Chinese literatus and deeply engage in the Confucian/Mandarin atmosphere. Ricci’s most prominent and influential interpretation for the Chinese is to understand Christian God in the original Confucian classics, in which the supreme Shangdi 上帝or tian 天 (heaven) could be equivalently termed as Catholic Deus. Ricci’s return to the Chinese antiquity to conduct his religious adaptation to Chinese culture, standing in conflict with contemporary Neo-Confucianism, was an original way to invent an indigenous comprehension of Christianity. Ricci’s argument for early Chinese awareness of the Christian God was to appropriate ancient Chinese terms and imposed on it the Christian meaning of the highest Creator. Although the following controversy after Ricci’s death regarding this terminology abandoned them and preferably officiated the Tianzhu 天主, the Lord of Heaven, as the newly coined Chinese term for God, we have considered this “Confucian Christianity” as a highly original hybrid: a monotheist religion and a purist Confucian tradition. It is not merely a result of an ambitious cultural accommodation but also, from the perspective of religious history, one of the most significant characteristic products of the early missionary Christianity in China.
The second characteristic of this period could point to another outcome resulting from the intensive and interactive dialogues of the Jesuits and Chinese Mandarins. Tianxue 天學, learning of Heaven, appeared as a new discipline in the intellectual landscape of Late-Ming China. It indicates the Jesuit evangelization through European sciences and knowledge, which were also expected, in the missionary view, to meet Chinese intellectual interests and political needs. The above two characteristics demonstrate the importance of Jesuit accommodation, and also which raised one of the most well-known debates for Christian evangelization during this period, the Chinese Rites Controversy. One of the central controversial issues was the Jesuit interpretation of the Chinese worship of ancestors as the civil and social meanings without conflict with Christian monotheism. Deriving both from the criticisms of other Catholic religious orders, also working in East Asia on a comparatively smaller scale than the Jesuits, and from those doubts inside the Society itself, the Controversy lasted over one century. The Roman Church issued the final rejection of the Jesuit accommodation in 1742.",1580,1740,1583,1197,Hui-Hung Chen,45,Matthew Hamm,2022-06-24 11:06:27.662 +0200,2022-07-22 11:47:54.357 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.11637758902791785,0.0031862116474326773,0.7122717531965875,0.1681271606495736,3.728547848813905e-05,5.411822901162873e-33
1434,Kuna,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Kuna, whose name for themselves is “Tule,” are an indigenous Central American group living along the northern coast of Panama. Originally from the Gulf of Urabá in present-day Colombia, the Kuna fled Spanish occupation in the 17th century and settled in what is now the Darién Province of Panama, eventually relocating to their current location on the San Blas Islands and northern coast. Through a combination of strategic alliances, negotiation, and rebellion, the Kuna have managed to maintain much of their cultural and political identity in the face of colonial pressure to assimilate. This entry focuses on ethnographic evidence collected during fieldwork with the Kuna shortly after 1925, when La Revolución Tule (the Kuna Revolution), in response to assimilation pressure, won the Kuna semi-autonomous status for their land. During this time, traditional Kuna religion was still practiced, although syncretism with Christianity, and in particular Protestantism, was present. Living a righteous life, so as to avoid angering the supreme high god Pab Dummat, was of central importance in Kuna religion. The righteous were rewarded in the afterlife and wrongdoers were punished. Considerable political and religious overlap appears to have been present both in community leaders and in ceremonies. For example, large religious singing or chanting ceremonies took place in the same community meeting houses used for political purposes. Because religious beliefs were inseparable from almost all aspects of social and political life, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society at large.",1912,1937,1589,1090,Anj Droe,1,M.

1466,Islamic modernists,43,Religious Group (v6),"""Islamic modernists"" (hereafter ""modernists"") can be described as thinkers who try to reinterpret or ""reform"" practices, institutions, norms, and foundational texts of Islam in line with what they understand to be the challenges of modernity. They are a capacious ""group"" active since roughly the start of the 19th century, working in a variety of settings within and outside of ""the Muslim world,"" especially in governments and educational centres, from traditional mosque-universities in the Middle East and North Africa to universities in Europe and North America. Historians argue that modernists were at their most prominent from the late 19th to the mid-20th century, in other words, during the most intensive period of colonialism in Africa and Asia. Subsequently, they lost much of their momentum and were increasingly peripheral in intellectual and political debates. Historians offer different explanations for the waning of the modernist project. For instance, Henri Lauzière (2016) argues that the need for unity in anti-colonial movements in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) provided a supportive context for modernism (he uses the Arabic term, ""al-islah al-mua'tadil,"" ""moderate reform""), which shifted towards a conservative, ""purist"" Salafism when activists and intellectuals drifted apart after independence. In his 2018 monograph, Islam in Pakistan, Muhammad Qasim Zaman links the weakness of modernists to their failure to establish a social base comparable to that of 'ulama' (Muslim scholars) and Islamists, and their tendency to ally themselves with authoritarian rulers. The mid-20th century historian Albert Hourani suggests that modernists ""opened the door to"" secularism. This was inadvertent, since the modernist goal was to steer a ""middle way"" between tradition and secularism, broadly defined. From another perspective, historians such as James McDougall explore the modernist investment in (secular) nationalism. To sum up this literature, it can be said that modernists gave way to both secularism and Islamism, the balance between these forces depending on place and time. Today, those who position themselves as successors of 19th and 20th century modernists include everyone from ""liberal"" and ""secular"" intellectuals to leaders of Islamist political parties. 

Scholarship on modernists addresses not only ""the Muslim world,"" but also areas such as Britain, Germany, Canada, and the United States, since some modernists have had careers at western universities. To indicate modernism's broad geography, the map with the present entry encompasses western Europe along with several representative universities in North America, specifically McGill University and the University of Chicago. These are among the key institutions highlighted in the 2021 book by Megan Brankley Abbas, Whose Islam? The Western University and Modern Islamic Thought in Indonesia.

The question of what to select as an ""end date"" for modernists is complex, partly because of the success of modernism at Euro-American universities. A case can be made for describing modernism as an ongoing movement, but I have selected 1980 to indicate the precariousness of modernists in the regions where they first emerged and on which their ambitions have focused, the MENA, South Asia, South-East Asia, Central Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa.",1800,1980,1624,1209,Julian Weideman,1,M.

1529,Byzantine Iconoclasts (726-787 CE),43,Religious Group (v6),"Byzantine iconoclasts (image breakers) were not always a homogenized group, but we now use the term to represent the interlocutors who codified the social, political, and religious conflict with iconophiles (lovers of images) into law. The first period of Iconoclasm (image breaking) in Byzantium is usually attributed to the 720s CE. Textual sources report that a prominent icon (portrait) of Christ was removed from public view in Constantinople in 726. This led to subsequent debates over whether and how it was appropriate to depict holy figures in art. The controversy oscillated until a church council in 754 forbade the use of icons, a mandate that lasted until 787. 

The process of iconomachy (image struggle) emerged alongside Christianity in late antiquity. As the religion spread from its origins in Jerusalem toward Rome, Constantinople, and nearby regions, practitioners of the new religion developed a visual vocabulary and artistic practices. By the sixth century, Christian icons depicting holy figures and narratives were used in churches and on domestic items. Christians also venerated holy relics, the material remains of holy people who had died and were thought to be heavenly intercessors for the living. Christians differentiated their use of icons and relics from the use of pagan idols by interpreting holy images as providing access to the divine. Periods of Byzantine iconomachy occurred because there were Christians who, for various reasons, had an aversion to figural religious images.

A gathering of bishops at the Quinisext Council in 691-692 attempted to codify the respectful use of religious images. For example, they insisted on depicting Christ as a man rather than symbolically as a lamb. The council’s careful attention to image use points to the emerging controversy among Orthodox Christians about whether and how it was appropriate to depict holy figures in material icons. 

In contrast to the visual culture of iconophiles, iconoclasts argued that earthly matter was inadequate for depicting the divine. Some took the biblical second commandment forbidding the worship of idols (Exodus 20:4-5) as a mandate against use of religious images that could be construed as idolatry. This was in keeping with existing Jewish practices in late antiquity. Many others, including Monophysite Christians in eastern provinces, preferred aniconic (non-figural) images or symbolic representations of Christ such as a cross or the celebration of the Eucharist (bread and wine commemorating Christ’s sacrifice and resurrection). 

Some sources attribute the spread of iconomachy to increasing familiarity with aniconic Muslim practice, which criticized the Christian use of figural imagery. Byzantines knew these beliefs primarily through military encounters during the Islamic conquests by the seventh century. 

Iconoclasm as imperial policy is often associated with Emperor Leo III (r. 717-741), who had risen to power through a military career. He was credited with the removal of the Christ icon from the Chalke Gate, a prominent entrance to the imperial palace in 726. Another event during his reign was the dismissal of iconophile Germanos I from his position as Patriarch of Constantinople in 730. It is important to note, however, that Leo’s iconoclastic tendencies were only recorded in texts written by later iconophiles.

Leo’s son and successor, Constantine V (r. 741-775), was a documented iconoclast. In 754 he called a church synod (assembly of bishops) that forbade the creation of holy portraits in material form. The synod also rejected the use of icon veneration in domestic, personal settings, although it made a point to honor Christ as well as the Virgin and saints through aniconic means. 

Notably, the effects of iconomachy were primarily in Constantinople. It is not clear whether many images were actually destroyed due to the ban or how stringently the ban was implemented outside the capital. It is possible that the controversy was primarily a philosophical and legal debate rather than a period of widespread material destruction of existing icons. 

The first period of Byzantine Iconoclasm ended with the Iconophile Interlude (787-802). Empress Irene (regent from 780-797) called a new church council that ruled in favor of religious portraits in 787, saying that the honor paid to the image is transferred to its holy prototype.

1544,Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church is both a minority faith in Ukraine yet also a Church that has exerted a great deal of influence on Ukrainian culture and politics throughout the 19th and 20th centuries until today. While most Ukrainians identify as Orthodox, in the regions of western Ukraine it was the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church that historically served as the religious affiliation for the Ukrainian-speaking population. Created as a hybrid Church through a church union (the 1596 Union of Brest) as a way to absorb Orthodox Slavs into Catholic jurisdictions in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, this religious institution remained an influential force in the territories of present-day western Ukraine as empires rose and fell in eastern Europe. The Church endured as its parishes became part of Habsburg Austria-Hungary, interwar Poland, and even under Nazi occupation. This endurance is credited to one of the most influential leaders of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, Metropolitan Andrei Sheptytsky, who served as Metropolitan from 1900-1944. Under his tenure, the Church sought to create a path for itself as both a religious institution and a Ukrainian cultural institution. Metropolitan Sheptytsky’s death coincided with the imposition of Soviet power in western Ukraine in 1944. Over the course of this history, the rituals and beliefs of Ukrainian Greek Catholics were deeply influenced by the more powerful religious institutions surrounding it, the Vatican and the Russian Orthodox Church. The Church endured campaigns of forced transfer to Russian Orthodoxy in territories conquered by imperial Russia and in territories ruled by Catholic monarchies, forced latinizations of its rituals. In the aftermath of the Second World War and the Sovietization of western Ukraine, the Soviet state did not simply ban the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, but embarked on a religious campaign that resembled that of its imperial predecessors, forcing its three million Ukrainian Greek Catholics to join the state-sponsored Russian Orthodox Church. Some accepted Orthodoxy, others simply pretended to accept Orthodoxy, while others maintained the practices of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in the underground. Through these experiences, the Church developed its own particular liturgical practices and rituals that reflected its interpretations of what a church union between Orthodoxy and Catholicism meant in practice. These practices reflect a complex negotiation of religious influences imposed by force, as well as influences welcomed into the Church through natural processes of cultural exchange. Because of its hybrid nature, the Church also became a religious institution that tolerated a great deal of variation among rituals between its parishes. In practice this means that while Church institutions have taken formal positions on the correct interpretation of variances between the Byzantine and Latin-rite, variances that include the sacrament of the Eucharist and the filioque, different parishes will follow different customs based on their particular histories and the practices and traditions most familiar to local parishioners. The Church's recent history has been shaped by its role in independent Ukraine. As the Soviet Union began to collapse in the early 1990s, the Church was permitted to emerge from the underground and its activists became instrumental in the movement for Ukraine's independence from the Soviet Union. In recent decades, the Vatican has attempted to codify the rituals and practices of Eastern churches like the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church as part of a project of recognizing the contributions of these unique spiritual cultures, rather than seeing them as aberrations that need to be “latinized.” Today, the Church's endurance is seen as tied up with the endurance of the Ukrainian nation itself, even though that nation is primarily Orthodox. As an institution, the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church maintains an intensive involvement in Ukrainian society through its network of educational institutions, charitable endeavors, and military chaplaincy, involvement which influences Ukrainians of all faith traditions.",1596,2022,331,1110,Kathryn David,40,Stephen Christopher,2022-10-17 17:51:16.716 +0200,2022-12-02 00:08:01.710 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.10289570404474999,0.0027358469064437934,0.7991461272260284,0.09521348226147294,8.839561304797324e-06,2.7515748570704356e-34

1570,Tamil Muslims,43,Religious Group (v6),"Tamil Muslims are a community in southern India who practice Islam. Although a very diverse group, they share some common religious, cultural, and linguistic affinities. They are primarily located in Tamil Nadu, India, with populations spread across India, Sri Lanka, South East Asia, Gulf Cooperation Countries (GCC), and the United States. Muslims in Tamil Nadu are not a monolithic community; they speak multiple languages (mainly Tamil, Urdu, Telugu, and Bohri Gujarati), and have diverse histories and practices. This entry primarily focuses on Tamil-speaking Muslims in India.

Islam has a long and distinctive history in the Tamil region, at least since ninth century through centuries-old Arab trade, and largely separate from the more familiar narratives of Muslim conquest in north India. The circulation of religious practices and the maintenance of oceanic connections is an important aspect of both Tamil Muslim history as well as the present. The Tamil region has had historical connections with the Bay of Bengal littoral through the circulation of Muslims and their textual practices—between Tamil-speaking South India (Ma’bar) and Southeast Asia (Nusuntara)—since at least the fifteenth century. 

Coastal trading towns in Tamil Nadu became well-known for their religious spaces and institutions—mosques, dargahs (tomb-shrines of Muslim saints), and madrassas (Islamic religious schools). It was not just the southern coastal belt but also northern Tamil Nadu where notable Islamic seminaries were established. The inland city of Madurai was briefly ruled by the Madurai Sultanates in the fourteenth century, while the Urdu-speaking Arcot Nawabs have also had a presence in the region since the seventeenth century.

A simplified sociological and caste-like classification of Tamil-speaking Muslims exists, namely the distinction between Maraikkayar (elite, coastal Sunni Muslims who were originally seafaring merchants),  Lebbai (religious scholars but from a lower social-economic strata), and Rowther (descendants of former Muslim cavalrymen who traded in horses). However, scholars such as Torsten Tschacher have cautioned against the homogenizing imperative and orientalist presuppositions of such sociological distinctions. Although this terminology continues to be used by Muslims today, the diverse ways in which people self-identity with one “sub-group” or the other cannot stand in for a classificatory schema. 

Today, Tamil Nadu is home to various Muslim shrines (dargahs), important pilgrimage centers, historical mosques built in the Dravida style of architecture, and Islamic seminaries. Tamil Muslim cuisine is distinctive, with influences from Arab, Malay, Sri Lankan, and Southeast Asia regions.",1900,2024,1117,1248,Harini Kumar,43,Quinn Clark,2022-11-11 01:51:51.538 +0100,2024-05-31 23:18:25.652 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.10289570404474999,0.0027358469064437934,0.7991461272260284,0.09521348226147294,8.839561304797324e-06,2.7515748570704356e-34
1574,Household religion at Ur,43,Religious Group (v6),"Ur, modern Tell el-Muqayyar, in southern Iraq, is one of the most ancient cities of Mesopotamia; it hosted a very important cult complex dedicated to the Moon-God – Nanna in Sumerian, Suen in Akkadian – including a temple, a ziqqurat and residences for the king and the high priestess. Two extended quarters of private houses, dating from the beginning of the 2nd millennium BCE were brought to light; they are quite well preserved and many of them featured burials under their floors. Of particular interest are some built underground tombs: according to L. Woolley, their excavator, these tombs were related to large rooms, with special features interpreted as cult installations, and with the largest  room of the house, interpreted as a reception room. The final interpretation was that at Ur they practiced funerary cults  for the ancestors in private chapels, accessible to the members of the household and to their guests. Upon a new analysis of the evidence, it was observed that the connection between built tombs and chapels was not a constant element: in 15 houses there were chapels only; in 15 houses the chapel was related with a tomb; in 17 houses there were the tombs but no chapel. Chapels for private cults are also attested in the same period at Nippur, Tell Asmar and Tell Brak, but they are not associated with tombs. The chapels feature altars ca. 50 cm high and structures looking like miniature temples, up to 1.40 m high; a hearth with a long chimney reaching to the roof was interpreted as an incense-burner. The main interpretations for these chapels are: 1) places for funerary cults (to be dismissed for the lack of a constant correlation with tombs); 2) cult for ""family gods"" (doubtful because minor gods had their small temples within the domestic quarters); 3) places for private ceremonies connecting the extended family and other social groups to enhance social bonds, for instance for marriages and/or economic contracts.",-2000,-1800,1328,1258,Frances Pinnock,50,Andrew Danielson,2022-11-14 14:26:47.018 +0100,2022-11-14 14:26:47.018 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),6.268200932996991e-68,5.050279579495568e-46,1.3332633576350945e-156,2.0531884592287227e-109,7.265761352712925e-18,1.0
1582,Cult of Bona Dea,43,Religious Group (v6),"Who exactly was Bona Dea (“Good Goddess”) can be extrapolated from the myths found in a couple of imperial sources. According to Plutarch (Plut. Quaest. Rom. 29.268DE; Arnobius Nat. 5.18; Lactantius D.I. 1.22.9-11) (Versnel 2006), Bona Dea was the wife of Faunus who was so pure that she never left her room. Yet, one day she secretly became drunk that Faunus beat her to death but repented and made her a deity. Or she, called Fauna, Ops, or Fatua, was the daughter of Faunus who lusted after her, pursued her, and beat her with myrtle branches; he finally achieved his goal after transforming into a snake (Macrob.Sat.1.12.24) (Versnel 2006, 1992). Additionally, there is an account that states that Hercules was celebrating the festival of Bona Dea but was refused a drink by the women; therefore, Hercules excluded women from celebrating his sacrifice at the Ara Maxima (Versnel 2006). There are also some Bacchanal associations in antiquity with the Bona Dea practice (Mulroy 1988; Dieterich 1893), such as the identification of the goddess with Semele (Macrobius 1.12.23), the exaggeration of the ceremony as an orgy (Juvenal 6.314-34), flagellation, the presence of serpents that point to the Maenads, and this would explain Clodius’ cross-dressing (see the account below). Yet, Lott (2014/15), following Brouwer (1989), has claimed that Bona Dea had no male consort in the Roman cult, despite the story given by Plutarch.

What we know about the cult of Bona Dea from literary and archeological evidence is that the cult of Bona Dea may have had origins in Latium and non-uniform cultic practice depending on the social class of the worshipper. In the state cult of Roman religion only women participated in the ceremonies in nocturnal and secret celebrations on December 1st in the house of the leading Roman consul (Brouwer 1989). Under supervision of the wife or mother of the Roman consul of that year, the consul had to leave his house and all the images of male members of the familia (“Roman family’) had to be removed (Versnel 1992, Brouwer 1989). In participation were also the Vestal Virgins (Cic.Har.res.37; Plut.Caes.9), priestesses who took vows of celibacy and attended to the Sacred Flame.

There is some information about the rituals from Cicero and imperial sources. According to ancient literary sources (North 2018; Versnel 2006), the room where the ritual took place was decorated with vine twigs, though myrtle was banned (Plut. Quaest. Rom. 20.268D). There was the sacrifice of a porca (“sow”) (Macrob.Sat.1.12.23), and the drinking of wine, called lac (“milk”), and brought in a mellarium (“honey pot”) (Macrob.Sat.1.12.25; Plut. Quaest. Rom. 20.268D), and there was music and dancing. Versnel 2006 sees this aristocratic practice as a vestigial element of an older Roman practice that celebrated human and agricultural activity, and its closeness to the Greek festival of Demeter, the Thesmophoria, which took place in the political center of the city, denied men access, celebrated female reproductivity, allowed women the rights of men, such as the enjoyment of wine (Versnel 2006; 1992; not absolute rule, see Piccaluga 1964; De Cazanova 1987; Aulus Gellius 10.23.1-2), but excluded myrtle, because myrtle was closely associated with Venus (sexuality) in the ancient sources, such as Plutarch (Quaest.Rom.20), Pliny (NH 15.121), and Varro (de ling.lat. 5.154) (Brouwer 1989). Because wine was also an aphrodisiac (Val. Max. 2.1.5), myrtle was removed in order to highlight a ritualistic use of the wine traditionally offered to the gods (temetum) (Versnel 1992) (Brouwer 1989). If one considers the presence of the Vestal Virgins as well, the Roman matrons too are considered ambiguously virgins (Versnel 1992).

Hence the great scandal in 62 BC involving Publius Clodius Pulcher whose account is detailed fully in Plutarch’s Caesar 9-10 (his political enemy Cicero also makes some remarks on Clodius’ cross dressing: Ad Atticum.1.12.2; 1.13.3). As the story goes, Clodius was in love with Pompeia, married to Caesar and who was being watched by her mother-in-law Aurelia. Because of this, Clodius dressed up as a flute girl in order to see Pompeia on the night of the Bona Dea at her house (also in Cic.de Haruspicum Responsis 5.8). He was admitted by a slave girl who was involved in the scheme, and Clodius, tired of waiting for Pompeia, went to go find her. In some accounts (Velleius Paterculus 2.45.1, Suet.Caesar 6.2; Appian Bella Civilia .2.14.52; Cassius Dio 37.45; Livy’s epitome 103), building upon Cicero’s speeches (Mil.72, Harusp.8; Pis.95) Clodius and Pompeia committed adultery (Mulroy 1988). In Plutarch’s version, however, he was accosted by another slave girl, who first asked him to play with her, and he answered that he was waiting for Habra, the very name of his inquirer. Habra recognized the male voice and screamed that a man was present. Aurelia stopped the service and Clodius was found hiding in Habra’s room. The women went home, told their husbands, and political outcry occurred. As a result, Caesar divorced Pompeia.

Another important cult site in the city of Rome was that of the Aventine Hill where a temple and images of snakes were found. At first, the cult utilized the image and symbol of the Italic serpent which was a protective and guardian spirit; yet over time with the association of Bona Dea and Hygieia and other Greek influence, the snake became associated with prophecy and healing (Brouwer 1989). Returning to the temple and grove on the Aventine (Morgan 2014, Merlin 1906, Rubino 1868, Gilbert 1883-90), it has been identified as Bona Dea Subsaxsana (Propertius 4.9.24, 25, 33, 35, 53, 59-60; Ovid. Fasti. 3.327-30; and a Severan marble plan) and her celebrations occurred on May 1st. This festival in May mirrors that of the State Cult practice on December 1st where a female sacerdos (“priestess” in this context) led a secret rite that included the sacrifice of a (pregnant) sow, the use of wine, and prohibition of men from participation. Here, it is important to note that the sacrifice of the sow (Macrobius Saturnalia 1.12.20-29 and Juvenal 1.2.92-90) is rather scanty and there are examples in non-state cult functions, such as a fowls (Pliny NH 10.61 (77)) and heifers (via Ostiense , CIL Vi 68= ILS 3513)(Brouwer 1989).

There were also imperial practices outside the city of Rome. For example in Aquileia, although numerous inscriptions (CIL 5 761-762=ILS 3498-3499) point to a goddess with agricultural characteristics not emphasized in the Roman cult (Lott 2014/15), there was a temple dedicated to Augusta Bona Dea Cereria at Aquileia (Ov.Fas.5.157-8), restored by Livia, the wife of the emperor of Augustus. This location was not only for honoring Livia, but a center of worship of the goddess in which there was cake distribution on Livia’s birthday (ILS 154)(Lott 2015/15)(Brouwer 1989). Imperial Augustan involvement might be corroborated by Berry’s (2011) analysis of the Bona Dea and Hercules episode recounted in Propertius 4, 9 where Hercules (representing imperial legislation on proper sexual behavior) bursts into the Sacred Grove, its waters, and dancing girls (private and elegiac context). According to Berry, the episode is a commentary on the legislation of 18 BC lex Iulia de maritandis ordinibus the intrusion of public world into Roman private lives. Yet, the combination of imperial nomenclature at Aquileia and the local goddess demonstrates how local communities built a consensus and relationship with the new imperial regime (Lott 2015/15) (Ando 2000).
 
We also know that throughout Latium and Rome there was the involvement of collegia (“professional clubs”) that invoked Bona Dea as their patroness. Inscriptions paint a different picture from the aristocratic, political rituals detailed above (North 2018, and Versnel 2006). In the cultic practice by Roman collegia, there was no secrecy and men could participate (Brouwer 1989). Collegia members and ritual activity involving Bona Dea could include children, such as a seven-year-old priest (Waltzing I)(Brouwer 1989) and numbers of participants from 16 (CIL XIV 252 = Waltzing III, p.618, #2233) to 1,5000 (CIL VI 1060, 9405, 10.300 = Waltzing III, pp.199-200)(Brouwer 1989). Leaders of collegia and cult activity had numerous titles associated with them: curator, magister, minister, with sacerdos usually in the east (Brouwer 1989) and meeting locations could include aedes (“shrines”) or templa where the patron deity resided.

Other non-Roman cult practices included a Liburnian Bona Dea (CIL 5 757=ILS 4894), who was paired with the male deity, Fonio (Lott 2014/15). Also, a temple found in Ostia with paintings, excavated in 1938-1942 by Calza dating to the AD first century (Falzone 2006). The temple occupied a trapezoidal area in the back of the via degli augustali and had Late Republic to Domitian phases (Falzone 2006). The paintings found in the temple and portico depicted dancing Maenads and, perhaps, a Satyr, the offering of the grape (wine), and Dionysian elements all recall themes found in the myths of the Bona Dea (Falzone 2006). There is also a second temple found in Ostia outside the Porta Marina (Calza 1942; Meiggs 1973; Brouwer 1989). Finally, numerous inscriptions, such as in Segni in south Latium (EE VIII 624 = Dessau, ILS 3496)  and Fidenae (NSc.1929,263,Nr.11) that show that clothes were dedicated to the goddess, are attested throughout Italy and demonstrate is popular practice.

Bona Dea, moreover, was worshiped in private homes and demonstrate a multiplicity of ideas regarding the role Bona Dea played in the lives of private individuals under the Roman Empire. The most notable is the dedication of Calpurnia found in Dalmatia that included a host of titles, such as Heiae, Dominae, Augustae, Triumphali, terrae/marisque Dominatrici, Conservatrici, Mentiumque bonarum ac remediorum Potenti, Dea bene iudicanti  (Brouwer 1989, ch.1 #127). Here we can see Greek and Eastern influence on the salvific powers of Bona Dea. Some scholars have suggested that the Greek goddess was introduced in the 3rd century BC, while others, argued for a genuine Italian character. Versnel 2006 suggests that there was one Italian and one Greek, and at some point, the cults merged into one. Whatever the case may be, it seems that the female goddess was the protector of her locality.

In sum, the cult of the Bona Dea, perhaps, began in Latium and as Roman power expanded in the Mediterranean so did the cult (found also in Africa and Gaul), while it also adopted ideas from Greek and Eastern religions. The cult, perhaps, although epigraphic and literary sources at earliest date back to the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC, began in the prehistory of Latium (Brouwer 1989) and lasted until the 5th century AD, although some have argued for an earlier date of demist to the Antonine plague in 2nd and the Cyprian plague in the 3rd century AD (Ambasciano 2016). The cult of Bona Dea, however, nevertheless continued to enjoy literary discussion well into the 8th century AD, such as the Epitome of Paulus Diaconus (ca. AD 720/730-797) (Epitome s.v. Damium). Finally, the cult enjoyed worship from every facet of Roman life, ranging from the aristocratic state cult practices to that of even freedmen and slaves.

1615,Teuchitlan Tradition,43,Religious Group (v6),"Guachimontones es el asentamiento rector de un complejo cultural del occidente mesoamericano que se conoce bajo el concepto “La Tradición Teuchitlán”. El término fue acuñado por Weigand en 1993 en el que englobó evidencia arquitectónicas y materiales que definen a dicha sociedad. Ahora sabemos qué, más que una tradición, representa el resultado de un entrelazado de prácticas político-religiosas, económicas y cotidianas que forman una cultura compleja (Beekman y Weigand 2008; Blanco Morales 2010:6 Smith 2009; Weigand 1993). Las primicias de las investigaciones de Weigand y sus colaboradores afirmaron que el inicio, apogeo y declive de esta cultura sucedieron entre los años 200 y 400-500 d.C. (Weigand 1993), sin embargo, gracias a las extensas excavaciones que se realizaron a finales de la década de los años noventa e inicios del siglo XXI en el centro rector (Guachimontones/Loma Alta) y en el sitio de Navajas, se fechó quinientos años antes, es decir, entre los años 300 a.C. al 350/450 d.C. (Beekman y Weigand 2008:326-Fig. 9).

La sociedad, además del trabajo artesanal, la caza la pesca y recolección, practicó principalmente la agricultura, siendo sus cultivos principales el amaranto y maíz (Weigand 2008, Stuart 2003, 2005). Su sistema de creencias, aunque en una etapa joven de desarrollo, es el resultado de una tradición local, en donde emanan historias y conceptos que la ligan con el mundo ideológico y cosmológico del que resulta Mesoamérica (Blanco Morales 2012; Heredia y Englehardt 2016) definida por López Austin (1996; 2000) como ""Tradición Religiosa Mesoamericana"". 

Su connotación religiosa se puede vislumbrar en su arquitectura cívico-ceremonial y mortuoria (Blanco Morales 2009: 69-79; López Mestas, 2011; Ohnersorgen y Varien, 2008; Smith, 2009; Weigand 1992; 1993), así como en la iconografía plasmada en los objetos suntuarios. La armónica planeación y organización del espacio, junto con la presencia de especialización de materiales como obsidiana, concha y cerámica (Esparza 2004; Esparza y Tenorio 2004; López Mestas 2011; López Mestas 2005: 235; Weigand 1993; Weigand, García y Glascock 2004), y una posible especialización e intensificación agrícola vista a través de la agricultura hidráulica (Weigand, 1993; Stuart, 2005) explica la presencia de ciertos mecanismos reguladores a nivel regional y, por ende, un aparato organizativo que , mientras Weigand y otros autores lo definen como un estado incipiente (Weigand 1993), según Jorge Ramos y Lorenza López Mestas sugieren los indicios de un cacicazgo complejo (López Mestas y Ramos 2002, López Mestas 2011). Aún así, pese a disparidad entre dichas argumentaciones, en ambos casos la importancia religiosa como un medio conciliador y coercitivo no se descarta ya que resultaría elemental para el fortalecimiento de las interacciones entre los asentamientos del núcleo. Sin lugar a dudas, el patrón circular como escenario ritual, las canchas de juego de pelota en cada uno de los sitios principales, la práctica mortuoria que implicó la elaboración de tumbas de tiro (López Mestas y Ramos 2002; López Mestas 2011) y la adoración a los ancestros, dan certeza de las principales actividades cívico-religiosas de los habitantes del occidente mesoamericano hace cuando menos 2350 años.",-300,400,1833,1309,Ericka Sofia Blanco Morales,56,Marijke Stoll,2022-12-30 22:39:35.364 +0100,2023-01-19 19:41:22.487 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.20185287952687725,0.22578991146870617,0.23787440716455047,0.20282918705490216,0.11215587285935862,0.019497741925605355
1624,Neo-Assyrian Healers (āšipu/mašmaššu-exorcists),43,Religious Group (v6),"The exorcist (Akkadian āšipu/mašmaššu) acted in an intellectual community as one of five main scholarly professions throughout the Neo-Assyrian period. Exorcists were primarily concerned with medical and magical healing, as well as diagnosing causes of illness, for private - and frequently highborn - clients. Furthermore, they could perform rituals for the city, temples, and the court. Accordingly, they were often connected to the royal court, as well as official and religious institutions in various cities. However, exorcists were not priests. Among the tools of their trade were numerous rituals, medical remedies, prayers, and incantations. Exorcists in the Neo-Assyrian period did not distinguish between what we today label as “magic” and “medicine”, instead believing that most illnesses were caused by supernatural forces, such as gods or demons. Once a patient was seized by an illness, healing could be achieved through identifying the ailment and the agent causing the malady, and subsequently applying therapeutic or ritual treatments to cure the illness and its symptoms, as well as ritual actions to appease the god in question. Healing therefore consisted of both medical and magical treatments, and the term encapsulates the combined focus in the exorcist’s methods for diagnosing and treating illness as well as ensuring social, physical, or mental wellbeing. Although an exorcist’s duties partially overlapped with those of the physician (asû) and diviner (bārû), the exorcist appears to have been the primary professional practicing a broad selection of traditional Assyrian and Babylonian healing methods in the Neo-Assyrian period. Accordingly, the translation “exorcist” is inadequate and often incorrect in describing his competences and duties. The majority of sources from this period can be dated roughly to the 8th and 7th centuries BCE, and they were excavated in the royal text collections at Nineveh, a temple library in Kalhu (Nimrud), private libraries in Assur (especially the “Haus des Beschwörungspriesters”), and a private text collection from Huzirina (Sultantepe).",-900,-612,582,1132,Troels Pank Arbøll,50,Andrew Danielson,2023-01-06 11:21:20.969 +0100,2023-01-17 13:21:21.264 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.25360121489615073,0.13410904628965975,5.19391531362639e-13,8.174819460209873e-13,0.6122897388128442,8.485114665810929e-15
1626,The Cult of Maritime Hera,43,Religious Group (v6),"The aim of this entry is to shed light on a largely unknown facet of the religious veneration of the Greek goddess, Hera. Evidence for Hera being worshipped as a goddess of the sea is derived from an interdisciplinary approach; the votive assemblages from her sanctuaries, of which at least 7 are seaside, her symbolic and material connections to the sea and water, and myths she is involved in. As a goddess of the sea, Hera was the recipient of at least 46 ship models discovered in a religious context and hundreds of other votives associated with maritime imagery. It is clear that she was worshipped in practical matters of seafaring, such as being prayed to for a safe journey or ideal weather conditions. However, there is also evidence for her maritime cult in a broader, instinctual, symbolic connection with the sea, related to aspects of creation, motherhood, liminality, and transitional spaces.",-800,-400,1852,1131,Kaitlyn Skinner,48,Gino Canlas,2023-01-10 08:37:32.400 +0100,2023-01-31 02:16:20.991 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),7.887781376108162e-28,4.220000103450302e-17,6.224952493569688e-74,9.296348103495335e-60,2.7952425147634986e-14,0.999999999999972
1653,Visigothic Homoian Christianity,43,Religious Group (v6),"Homoian (also homoean) Christians, from the ancient Greek homoios (ὅμοιος), meaning similar, believed that God the Father, and Christ the Son were similar in nature. This was distinct from Nicene Christianity which adhered to the view that the Father and Son were identical (homos-ὁμός) in nature. The theological position of Homoianism was presented at the Councils of Ariminium and Seleucia in 359 and ratified at the Council of Constantinople in 360 CE. Homoianism was favored by the emperors Constantius II and Valens. Homoian Christianity was championed by Acacius of Caesarea (died in 365 CE) and its followers were sometimes called 'Acacians'.

Arianism is often used (erroneously) in scholarship as a synonym for Homoian Christianity (as well as other theological positions rejecting the notion that the Son and Father are of the same nature). This stems from attempts by fifth-century CE opponents to slander Homoianism through association with the Alexandrian priest Arius (c.250 or 256-336 CE), who also believed that the nature of the Son was distinct from that of the Father.

Like other instances of religious conversion in Antiquity, the adoption of Homoian Christianity amongst Goths was a gradual process rather than a punctual event. The genesis of Homoian gothic communities occurred in 341 when Ulfilas (also Wulfila, c.311-383 CE), considered the apostle of the Goths, was appointed bishop of the Homoian (or a theological position best described as Homoian) communities in Gothic-controlled lands at the Council of Antioch. This would imply that there were indeed Christians already living in this area who had requested for a bishop. These may have been the descendants of Christian, Roman prisoners. He preached to and converted Gothic communities north of the Danube until he was expelled, along with many of his followers in 347/8 due to a Christian persecution in Gothia. Ulfilas and his followers settled in Moesia, in the Roman Empire. He developed a Gothic script and translated the Bible into Gothic. Homoian Christianity received imperial patronage from the emperors Constantius II from 350-61, during his time as sole ruler of the Empire, and from Valens until his death in 378. During this time, Ulfila' Gothic followers would adopt Homoianism, understood as a compromise between so-called 'Arianism' and Nicene Christianity due to its stipulation that the nature of Christ was similar to that of the Father.

During the reign of these two emperors, two other events can be pinpointed as part of the conversion process of Goths.
In 369, a power struggle occurred within the Thervingian people between Athanaric and Fritigern. Fritigern petitioned for support from the Roman emperor Valens. The Thervingian Goths under Fritigern's command converted to Homoian Christianity and requested theological teachers.
In 376, the westward movement of the Huns and Alans encroached on Gothic land and two gothic Groups, the Thervingi and Greuthungi, requested to cross the Danube into Roman land to seek refuge. The Thervingi were allowed to cross but the Greuthungi were denied entry. Nevertheless, the Greuthungi crossed into Roman land illegally. Conversion to Homoianism was a condition for admission and would have applied to all Goths entering the Empire at this time. 

The Council of Constantinople of 381, which was summoned by emperor Theodosius I and followed the Edict of Thessalonica, condemned Arianism (and its associate theological doctrine, Homoianism). Nevertheless, the council decreed that barbarian peoples could continue to practice Homoianism in the ways that their ancestors had. Scholars such as Herwig Wolfram argue that the conversion of Goths to Homoianism would have created a sense of unity, a distinct change from the heterogenous pagan beliefs from the pre-Christian era.

The exact ethnogenesis of the Visigoths, as a sub-group of Goths and other barbarian peoples has been disputed, but it seems likely that the identity of this group solidified under the Alaric in the 390s, until their definitive settlement in Aquitaine in 419 by the Roman Empire. Homoian Christianity became deeply entrenched within the ranks of the Visigothic aristocracy. Many Homoian bishops originated from aristocratic families.
In 579, Hermenegild, the son of king Liuvigild, converted to Nicene Christianity and led a revolt in Baetica. Liuvigild called a synod in Toledo in 580 which revised Homoian beliefs to be more acceptable to Nicene Christians. These reforms would have little impact given that Homoianism had already largely lost its appeal since the 560s, if not earlier. In the second half of the sixth century, Nicene and Homoian clergy, bishops and churches would be operating in parallel in most major cities in the Visigothic Kingdom.
Homoian Christianity would be replaced by Nicene Christianity as the state-sponsored religion at the third council of Toledo, in 589, convoked by king Reccared, who had himself converted to Nicene Christianity in 587. Former Homoian bishops were allowed to keep their posts and shared their duties with their Nicene counterparts, but metropolitans lost their province-wide authority.",341,589,1869,1339,Cédrik Michel,49,Ian Randall,2023-02-11 18:59:53.441 +0100,2023-10-01 18:55:31.332 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.2718707590996398,0.0011866374989406127,2.6350010473593562e-11,0.6753747756300775,0.05156782774499206,4.134235323022037e-28
1654,Le Parti du Mouvement de La Nahda حزب حركة النهضة,43,Religious Group (v6),"Une fraction des mouvements de l'Islam politique dans le monde arabe.
À la fin des années soixante du XXe siècle, la Jama'a al-Islamiyya الجماعة الإسلاميّة (Le groupe islamique) en Tunisie a commencé à se former. 
Au cours de l'année 1972, un groupe d'étudiants a annoncé sa propre identité politique et idéologique (religieuse), différente des identités politiques et idéologiques de gauche qui dominaient l'université à l'époque. Leur signature sur les déclarations qu'ils ont émises et accrochées aux murs de l'université ou du collège était ""Étudiants qui font la prière"".
Le 6 juin 1981, un groupe de personnalités politiques et scientifiques appartenant à la classe moyenne organisent une conférence de presse au cours de laquelle ils annoncent la formation d'un nouveau parti en Tunisie, l'appelant la «Mouvement de Tendance Islamique» (M.T.I.). Rashid Ghannouchi راشد الغنّوشي, Abdel Fattah Moro عبد الفتّاح مورو, Saleh Karkar صالح كركر et Ali Al-Areedh علي العريض étaient les plus éminents de ces personnages.
Ce qui a poussé ces personnalités à annoncer un parti à tendance islamique, c'est la vague d'ouverture apparue à l'horizon lorsque la figure destourienne (qui appartient au parti du pouvoir) à orientation arabo-islamique et africaine a pris les rênes du premier ministère de l'Etat tunisien.
Cependant, ce parti a rapidement connu un affrontement avec l'État, qui a refusé de lui accorder un visa de travail légal et emprisonné ses dirigeants, ce qui a entraîné de nouvelles figures de leadership, dont la plus célèbre est l'ingénieur Hammadi al-Jabali.
Pendant l'été de 1987, une forte confrontation a eu lieu entre la tendance islamique et le régime de Bourguiba. Cette confrontation s'est terminée par l'arrestation de la plupart des dirigeants historiques et de quelques dirigeants de la classe moyenne de l'organisation. La peine de mort attendait certains dirigeants, en particulier Rashid Al-Ghannouchi et le mathématicien Moncef Ben Salem.
Cependant, le coup d'État doux mené par le général Zine El Abidine Ben Ali a empêché ces peines de mort, et il semblait que la crise avec l'État se dirige vers une solution finale. Le mouvement a de nouveau cherché à obtenir un visa de travail légal et a changé son nom de «Tendance islamique» en «Mouvement Nahda». 
Cependant, l'affrontement violent entre le mouvement islamique et le régime n'a pas tardé, surtout après l'incendie du siège de l'Assemblée constitutionnelle démocratique au pouvoir à Bab Souika (l'ancien centre-ville de Tunis), qui a été menée par le mouvement Nahda, et à la suite de quoi l'un des gardiens de la place est mort.
Après cela, le mouvement Nahda a traversé des années que ses adhérents les nomment les années du Jénocide. Jusqu'à ce que la révolution du 17 décembre 2010 au 14 janvier 2011 ait lieu. Les immigrés islamistes sont revenus en Tunisie et ils ont reformé avec le reste des islamistes leur parti. Ensuite, ils ont demandé un visa pour un parti légal, qu'ils ont obtenu, et ils ont changé le nom de leur parti pour devenir le «Parti du mouvement Nahda».",1981,2023,1866,1225,Ali Makhlabi,55,Julian Weideman,2023-02-11 22:06:56.237 +0100,2024-05-15 20:04:00.637 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.10289570404474999,0.0027358469064437934,0.7991461272260284,0.09521348226147294,8.839561304797324e-06,2.7515748570704356e-34
1677,Royal Hittite Religion,43,Religious Group (v6),"Just as its contemporaries in the Late Bronze Age, Hittite state had a polytheist religion. The pantheon included hundreds of deities, which grew over time with the deities various cultures (e.g. Hattians, Palaeans, Luwians, Hurrians, etc.) that were incorporated through conquest or close contact, so much so that Hittites referred to their pantheon in general as the “Thousand Gods of Hatti,” the last word being a reference to their country. While the actual number of gods and goddesses may not reach a thousand, if all divine beings, like the demons (mythological creatures, animals, mixed beings) and topographical features (mountains, rivers, springs, etc.) included, the number certainly exceeds a thousand. The top deities of the pantheon were the Sun-deities, both male and female, and the Storm-gods. Syncretism only occurred in a limited fashion in the later periods of the empire. Thus, many local gods were distinguished from similar deities, resulting in numerous variations by location, e.g. Storm God of Hatti, Storm God of Zippalanda, Storm God of Nerik, etc. The divine world was conceived as a mirror of the human world, where anthropomorphic deities were organized in a hierarchy of various families and like humans had needs to eat, sleep, and even be entertained. Temples were the houses of the deities where they inhibited an image, typically an anthropomorphic statue, but in some occasions it could also be a zoomorphic statue, a worked or unworked stele, or even a manufactured symbol, such as a golden disk for a Sun deity. Of course, such man-made objects would only be inhibited by the deities through special rituals. While the most prominent gods, the Sun-deities and the Storm-gods were responsible for the essence of life with their sun-light and waters, other deities presided over various matters like warfare, birth, death, reproduction, love, and so forth. 
Since almost all of the written documentation of Hittites originates from the administrative archives of the Hittite state, what we know of their beliefs pertains almost entirely to the official cult of the state that was headed by the king and the royal family. The king as the high priest of all the deities had a special role between the gods and the humans. He had to ensure the deities of the land were served and taken care of by the people of Hatti, so that the deities would take care of the land and the people. To that effect the state maintained numerous temples all over the land for various deities. While not many Hittite cities have been explored, at their capital city Hattusa, modern day Boğazkale in central Turkey, ruins of over 30 temples have been unearthed. The administration ensured that temples all over Hatti were adequately staffed and maintained and the deities were properly served, which included daily ritual offerings. The temples were an extension of the state administration. They were provided by property and personnel, including slaves, to maintain their own economies, but were definitely not independent of the state. Annually, seasonally, or monthly, over a hundred religious festivals were conducted by the state cult throughout the year. The king was responsible in guiding all societal religious activities.  He and/or royal family members regularly travelled to various locations to attend the festival ceremonies. In festivals, deities are praised, provided with offerings, entertained with singers, dancers, and even sports activities, and in some instances the images of the deities were paraded in processions giving the public a rare opportunity to view them, who normally remained in the inner sancta of the temples accessible only to a select few. To oversee his duties properly, the king had to communicate with the gods, which was accomplished through various divinatory methods, such as extispicy, augury, lot oracles, dream incubation, or by interpreting unsolicited omens. Cultic specialists were experienced with numerous rituals that were performed for rite de passage like birth, puberty, marriage, death, or to treat illnesses and ailments. The funerals of the royal family involved cremation of the body. The dead kings and other royal family members were believed have “become gods,” and passed into the divine domain for a pleasant afterlife.",-1650,-1180,1884,1019,Tayfun Bilgin,50,Andrew Danielson,2023-02-28 03:53:30.873 +0100,2023-05-09 06:34:50.329 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.8553736219994474,0.01744127696632301,4.7394212094126535e-11,0.1075177085584978,0.019667392428337673,8.056545213600423e-19

1697,Stylite Monks,43,Religious Group (v6),"Stylites were Christian monks who followed in the tradition of the 5th century saint Symeon Stylites the Elder. Symeon, after enduring many years of asceticism on the ground, began living atop high, narrow columns in modern-day Syria. These columns restricted the movement of the saint, so that he could practice an even more rigorous asceticism than he could on the ground, and they allowed the saint to remain more withdrawn from society. Other monks began imitating Symeon almost immediately, and a number of monks still live atop columns today. The highest concentration of stylite monks remained in Syria, but stylites were also present in other regions, such as Cappadocia and Georgia, and numerous stylite saints were recorded in the Byzantine capital, Constantinople. Various saints’ lives (hagiographies) attach symbolic meaning to the columns used by stylite saints. Most notably, they may have symbolized the upward movement of monks towards the celestial paradise. Stylites sometimes had a role in affairs on the secular ground, as well, and their spiritual authority was often transferred to social or even political power. For example, Symeon Stylites the Elder once solved a conflict between Theodoret of Cyrus, an important theologian and historian, and the patriarch of Antioch. In Constantinople and the surrounding areas towards the end of the 5th century, the emperor Leo I was a regular visitor of the stylite Daniel, who became, therefore, the spiritual advisor to the political head of state. Later, especially starting in the late 6th century and early 7th century, stylite monks  offered their voices to heated debates between Chalcedonian christians and monophysites, particularly Antiochian stylites, often siding with the latter.",450,1450,1626,1400,Elizabeth Zanghi,49,Ian Randall,2023-03-24 13:48:25.824 +0100,2023-10-07 17:04:58.515 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.1260666023517078,0.0026586257021786845,0.7355090202515056,0.13556990717930117,0.00019584451530677124,2.5014109832965167e-33

From the mother abbey of Prémontré, which was established under the leadership of Norbert of Xanten (c. 1075-1134) and Hugues of Fosses (c. 1093-1164), the order spread widely across Europe during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The Premonstratensians observed the Rule of St Augustine, with significant influence from the Cistercian Order in terms of their mode of life and internal governance. The male members of the order were canons; while in some parts of Europe such as France, they often practiced a more contemplative form of life, in other regions they were frequently involved in pastoral care and preaching. In what is today northeastern Europe and western Poland, they played a prominent role in the conversion of peoples there to Christianity. Women were prominent members of the order in the first two centuries or so of its existence. They generally referred to themselves as “sisters” rather than as “canonesses”, however.

The development of Methodism in Zimbabwe has its roots in Britain and South Africa who initiated the missionary propagation of the word of God from the North to the South. Today we are witnessing a reverse of the spreading of the gospel where the Southern hemisphere is now going as missionaries to the North to minister in the diaspora. Currently the Zimbabwean Methodist Conference is seconding ministers to work in the diaspora. There is a total membership of 2754 members in diaspora. 339 in Australia, 75 in Botswana, 75 in Canada, 95 in Ireland, 33 in Schengen, 1163 in South Africa, 36 in United Arab Emirates, 853 in United Kingdom and 85 in United States of America (MCZ Agenda of Conference 2023:R61). Taking the example of the Methodist Church in Zimbabwe alone one can deduce that the global south has penetrated the global north. The focus of this study will be from 1891-2023, which represents the time that the first missionaries settled in Zimbabwe and were given the mandate to evangelize and established mission stations in Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe. Geographically, the entry reflects all the areas where Methodist Church in Zimbabwe operate across the spectrum of Zimbabwe and beyond. Methodism in Zimbabwe as shall be noted in the entry operate under the leadership of a Presiding Bishop who is in charge of the whole Zimbabwean Conference. The Zimbabwean Conference constitute eight districts namely: Bulawayo district, Hwange district, Gweru district, Masvingo district, Kadoma district, Marondera district, Harare West district and Harare East district. These districts are under the supervision of a District Bishop who has the responsibility to pastor the district and have an oversight to the whole district. The incumbents are to occupy these positions for a period of 5 years and they go back to the trenches. The succession plan helps the church to be strong and avoid divisions because of the structures that serve the interest of the church at the expense of an individual. The Methodist Church in Zimbabwe is unique and guided by strategic plan that is designed to fulfil its pillars.",1891,2023,1946,1436,Peter Masvotore,57,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,2023-05-03 12:40:31.937 +0200,2023-10-09 18:34:52.057 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.10289570404474999,0.0027358469064437934,0.7991461272260284,0.09521348226147294,8.839561304797324e-06,2.7515748570704356e-34

They speak Oyo dialect of  Yoruba  version language.  The people once an empire came into limelight around fifteen centuries. From oral history, the town was founded by Oranmiyan the last son of Oduduwa, the great ancestor of the Yoruba people. The religious and political existence of the people have the traces of migration linked with Ife origin due to common ancestral genealogy shared by all other Yoruba cities.  They have a ritual tradition which is spectacular but attached to Sango festival and oya festival. Oya  was the wife of  sango  during his life time. They showcased this festival with Bata drum and it makes it distinct for ritual practices. Sango is recognized as the spirit of thunder and lightning; he became the king of Oyo around sixteen centuries. He was known to be an historical figure with strange and unpredictable character. Their indigenous religion is known as Isese (Yoruba: Ìṣẹ̀ṣe) and is still practiced by a number of Yoruba people. It has also been incorporated into new religious traditions throughout the African diaspora. Oyo people developed customs such as brotherhood, the ruling of Alaafins, traditional art, drumming, spiritual dances and they speak Yoruba language like other tribes. Their belief and heritage make them distinct from another tribe. They have a unique talent in drawing and sculpturing. the Oyo Empire’s cultural heritage requires explaining spiritual dances and masquerades’ origins, as their philosophy is different from the modern. The religious practices of the Oyo people have a diffused system in which the orisas are considered as the messenger of divine creator. There is an understanding of nature and spirits in the template of their spirituality and religiosity. This explain more better their ethical devises in which makes man responsible and thus adhere to the maintenance of golden rule of law (law of karma) guided by nature as a paramount claim in human justice and socio communal relationship. The role and depth of Oyo’s influence in nurturing a Yoruba identity and consciousness among the Yoruba has continued to resonate across generations and boundaries. The Yoruba who today are found in the Southwestern part of Nigeria, the Republics of Benin and Togo, Brazil, Cuba, Trinidad and other places in the Caribbean have continued to imagine the glory and renown of the empire and the consciousness created by the Oyo and its Alaafins. Oyo has continued to live on in the lives, arts and the socio-cultural, economic and political arrangements prevalent among the Yoruba people, their neighbors and the African Diaspora

1820,"Cherubim and Seraphim Church Unification, Campus Fellowship",43,Religious Group (v6),"This is an entry about the Cherubim and Seraphim Church Unification Campus Fellowship, popularly known as
Isokan (Unification). It is a group interested in unifying the various factional bodies of the Cherubim and Seraphim (C&S) Church that got divided in 1929.

The Cherubim and Seraphim Church Unification (a.k.a. Unification), now known as the Cherubim and Seraphim Church Unification (Campus Fellowship) is a Cherubim and Seraphim church based in the institutions of higher learning in Nigeria and overseas. Its emergence was a result of the divisions that have taken place in the mother churches ever since its beginning and growth from 1925 to 1929. With the different factional bodies, what would have become of students in the higher institutions who are willing to continue to worship in the C&S setting and as members of the C&S? Thus, there was a need to have a C&S church that would serve as a church for any member of the C&S from home to join and worship his/her God. It was this that prompted some students at the University of Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University) to come together and start a C&S church devoid of factions in the C&S in March 1980. 

With penchant for worship in the C&S way and the help of some leaders of the Cherubim and Seraphim Movement Church (C&SMC), Ayo Ni O (late Special Apostle Prophet Elijah O. Akinrele, late Special Apostle Prophet (Dr) Gabriel Olubumi Fakeye, Pastor G.O. Baptist, Prophet Fasua and many more), this group of students came together at the Architecture Building (then, the Central Cafeteria) of the then University of Ife. It was this meeting that gave birth to the church, and present at the meeting were: Wale Adekoya, Michael O. Rufai, John Kayode Coker, Elijah Ajao, Kayode Sodipe, Garuba Ishola, and Olu Oduyoye with some other persons. The inauguration of the Church was done in May 1980. These students in their youthful ages came together with a vision to uniting the church which at large had been derided with many divisions. With the differences that are so obvious amidst their mother churches, their coming into school brought about a transformation into the establishment of a unified Cherubim and Seraphim. These students were not looking forward to being affiliated with any of their mother churches. They were not interested in titles, leadership tussles, polygyny, and so on. Instead of titles and leadership struggles, they employed the use of the President for their leader and brother and sister for the members of the church. One prominent thing worthy of note is that this unification group accepts only students of higher institutions as their members. The name of this group at inception was Cherubim and Seraphim Church Student Fellowship, University of Ife.",1980,2019,1082,1451,Oluwasegun Aluko,57,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,2023-07-05 13:05:08.251 +0200,2023-10-09 18:29:58.760 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.10289570404474999,0.0027358469064437934,0.7991461272260284,0.09521348226147294,8.839561304797324e-06,2.7515748570704356e-34
1829,Cherubim and Seraphim Unification Church of Nigeria (C&SUCN),43,Religious Group (v6),"This is an entry about the Cherubim and Seraphim Unification Church of Nigeria (C&SUCN). It is a group interested in unifying the various factional bodies of the Cherubim and Seraphim (C&S) Church that got divided in 1929. From a single entity that it was during the period of 1925 and 1929, the C&S church was able to increase in leaps and bounds. However, the division that crept in between the two leaders (Moses Orimolade Tunolase and Christianah Abiodun Emanuel nee Akinsowon on ownership of the church) brought a halt to the once resplendent movement that has caught the attention of many individuals in the country. While some prominent persons who have the interest of the group at heart decided to wade into the situation and bring about a peaceful resolution, unity seems elusive. As people were interested in bringing together different factional bodies, other factions continued to spring up. 
Nevertheless, the much-anticipated unity started gathering momentum in the early 1980s with the establishment of the Unification Council of Cherubim & Seraphim (also referred to hereafter as “the Unification Council” or simply as “the Council”).  The Council set to work and by 1986 a leader acceptable to all the federating churches emerged in Her Most Eminence Captain (Dr.) Christiana Abiodun Emanuel, who was installed as the Supreme Head (Olori). This Unification Council took off with five mother churches that include: the Eternal Sacred Order of Cherubim & Seraphim, The Praying Band of the Sacred Society of Cherubim & Seraphim, Cherubim & Seraphim Society, The Sacred Cherubim & Seraphim Society, and the Holy Order of Cherubim & Seraphim Church Movement, now known as Cherubim and Seraphim Movement Church. Over the years, the Unification Council metamorphosed into “the Cherubim & Seraphim Unification Church of Nigeria” (also referred to later as “the Unification Church” or simply as “the Church”) which was registered by the Corporate Affairs Commission of the country on 9th September 1999 and has continued to build on the foundation laid by the Council.
It must be noted that despite the founding of this Unification Church, many factional bodies are yet to join in this unification drive. Nevertheless, since the establishment of this unification group, the Cherubim and Seraphim Church as a whole now have a single mouthpiece that can voice the concern of the church at the centre. The group had hitherto achieved greater things being together regardless of being like a confederacy.",1986,2019,1082,1451,Oluwasegun Aluko,57,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,2023-07-06 12:15:25.243 +0200,2023-10-09 18:49:44.180 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.39387269098179467,0.0017661135345630615,6.544312045573728e-11,0.602003973099483,0.0023572223187162985,2.82321458728219e-32
1835,"The Cherubim and Seraphim Church of Zion, Ugbonla",43,Religious Group (v6),"The Cherubim and Seraphim Church of Zion was founded on 16th February 1948 in Ugbonla, Ilaje area on the eastern flank of Yorubaland in southwest Nigeria. It is an offshoot of the Cherubim and Seraphim (C & S) Society, a Christian movement which started as a praying group comprising crowds (people) who thronged the home where Abiodun Akinsowon was resident after she had a mysterious encounter. Abiodun had peeped into the chalice of a religious procession and had gone into a trance for days until Moses Tunolase Orimolade was contacted to help restore her to life. This occurred in 1925 in Lagos, Nigeria. As the society began to meet to pray and fellowship, two brothers of Ilaje origin who had visited Lagos and joined the C & S Society and had become very active members of the group. 


The two brothers (Alfred and Timothy Orogbemi) returned to Ilajeland in 1929 and introduced the C & S Society to their homeland. The society grew steadily till it began experiencing some internal crisis at about 1942. Some of her members had accused the church of its acquiescence with the local authority regarding the practice of twin infanticide sanctioned by the latter at the time. The aggrieved members began to pull out of the society as early as 1945 and had predicted that the church will lose its relevance in Ilajeland if it fails to rise to condemn the practice they considered unacceptable. It is widely believed among the antagonists of the practice that had the founder of the C & S Zion Church failed to pull out of the larger society in their homeland and established a reformed version of the church, the C & S Society in Ilajeland, the church would have lost currency with the people.


While the Holy Apostles community, Ayetoro (the first successful theocratic community in Ilajeland) took on a unique description of the interconnectivity between faith and woks and thus had a successful economic and technological campaign, the C & S church of Zion, Ugbonla founded one year after Ayetoro had a spiritual expansionist outlook. The latter expanded its influence and dominance in the area by successfully galvanising the almost fifty other smaller theocratic settlements which sprang up after it. Saint Elisha Lene Ogunfeyimi, the founder of Ugbonla community laid the foundation for several of the doctrinal guidelines which most of the other theocratic communities in Ilajeland subsequently adopted.

1869,IFA RELIGIOUS GROUP IN ILE- IFE,43,Religious Group (v6),"Ife is indeed a place of great cultural and religious significance among the Yoruba people in Nigeria. It holds a unique position in Yoruba history and traditions. Ife has a relatively small population of approximately 49,000 people. The Ooni of Ife, often regarded as the spiritual leader of all Yoruba people, is a figure of immense importance. The Ooni wields significant influence over both the historical and contemporary affairs of the Yoruba people. This leadership role is not just symbolic but carries practical importance in various aspects of Yoruba culture and traditions. Ife is deeply rooted in Yoruba religious traditions. The Yoruba people practice a form of traditional religion that involves the worship of various deities (orisha) and ancestral spirits. These deities play a vital role in Yoruba religious practices. Some of the prominent deities with strong connections to Ife include Oduduwa, Obatala, Yemonja, Aje, Ogun, and Ifa. Orunmila, the head of the Ifa cult, is particularly revered for his special gift of spiritual wisdom and knowledge, as well as for initiating Ifa divination, which is a central aspect of  Ife religious practices. Agriculture, particularly farming, is a crucial economic activity in Ife. The  Ife people  rely on farming for sustenance, trade, and medicinal purposes. Agriculture not only provides food but also serves as a source of traditional medicine, underlining its importance in the community's survival and well-being. The history of Ife is primarily passed down through oral traditions. While it may not be documented in written texts like religious scriptures, these oral histories are valuable sources of information about the city's cultural and historical significance. Oral traditions are a common way of preserving history and cultural knowledge among many African societies. The two notable kings in the history of Ife are Adesoji Aderemi and Okunade Sijuwade. They made significant contributions to the development of Ife.  Adesoji Aderemi, as the first indigenous governor of Western Nigeria, focused on promoting indigenous religion and cultural practices. Okunade Sijuwade continued to support social and religious activities in Ife, gaining international attention and recognition. Ife's rich cultural heritage, religious traditions, and historical importance make it a unique and vital city within Nigeria and the broader Yoruba culture. The Ifa group and the worship of Yoruba deities are integral components of the city's cultural and religious tapestry, reflecting the deep-rooted traditions and spirituality of the  Ife people. This entry will therefore look at the religious tradition of the Ifa group of ife  people.",1930,2015,2017,1460,olusegun oladosu,57,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,2023-07-18 15:52:40.382 +0200,2023-10-29 18:28:11.309 +0100,Personal Expertise,0.9948813014569766,0.0018625601177864183,1.4462519109095296e-11,6.550999720998316e-12,0.003256138404223569,1.2771871430575695e-30
1872,"The Holy Apostles Community, Ayetoro",43,Religious Group (v6),"The Holy Apostles Community, Ayetoro was founded in January 1947. The community came into existence after an irreconcilable difference broke between the Holy Apostles and the traditional institution in Ilajeland. The former had strongly opposed and publicly condemned the traditional practice of twin infanticide sanctioned by the latter in their homeland at the time. Prior to these confrontations, members of the Ayetoro community had identified as followers of the Cherubim and Seraphim Society which was introduced to Ilajeland in 1929. They had accused the leadership of the Cherubim and Seraphim in Ilajeland of acquiescence with the traditional practice and warned that the society would lose its relevance if it failed to speak up against the practice. Several acts of civil disobedience were reported against the prophets and members of the group which would later adopt the name: Holy Apostles.
 

Some of them were fined by the local authority while others served jail terms over charges preferred against them by the traditional institution which they contended with. But these punitive measures were not able to break their ranks until they organised themselves and began to migrate to uninhabited islands and swamps which belonged to families of notable personalities among them. Their first attempt at establishing a theocratic community was made in 1945. The primary aim of the group was to organise themselves and establish a new community which would be free from the influence and control of the local authority in their homeland. This attempt failed owing to the report made against the Holy Apostles by the traditional institution they opposed. Upon the receipt of the report, the District Officer at the Okitipupa Divisional Office of the Colonial Administration came down to the newly founded community to investigate the report. A member of the community attempted to harm the District Officer who brought the full weight of the law on the leaders of the newly founded community. When he and others arrested with him were released from custody, he refused to return to the community. This left a leadership gap which had to be filled. There were fears of attacks and mass arrests from the authorities. This informed the new leader’s consultations with the members on the need to relocate to a new site. They therefore migrated to Ayetoro in January 1947. 


In 1948, the Oba (monarch) of Ayetoro introduced communalism to the community. All members relinquished ownership of their personal belongings to the community and a new wave of development was witnessed. Within a decade, Ayetoro had become the first community to have public electricity in the Old Ondo Area. Besides, the community had built a functional technical workshop and college which trained marine engineers and other categories of technicians. They built a primary school and the first secondary school in Ilajeland. They invested heavily in transportation business by building boats which aided the movement of persons, goods and services along the waterways between Lagos in the west and Cameroon in the east. The community built fishing trawlers which launched into the ocean, harvesting varieties of fish which the community sold in markets locally and in Lagos. They built modern houses and constructed solid walkways on stilts. This development aided movement across the entire community and supported the Oba’s car to tour the community. It was a novel invention in Ilajeland. The community’s economic and technological advancement was rapid and well sustained that it soon began to attract the attention of the government and global development bodies. By 1970, Ayetoro abolished communalism and it soon began to witness decay to its economic assets. Today, the only visible traces of the once prosperous community are the relics of the assets it once deployed for economic and technological development. Over the years, Ayetoro has gone through some stages in her spiritual journey. In the past, especially at some point during the period of its massive economic and technological drive it played down on religion. It has again witnessed a revival of its spiritual fervour. The continuous existence of the community is threatened owing to the massive ocean surge which has permanently swept more than half of its original landmass under the Atlantic Ocean.",1947,2023,2063,1445,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,55,Julian Weideman,2023-07-22 18:30:39.906 +0200,2023-09-14 11:18:38.039 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.10289570404474999,0.0027358469064437934,0.7991461272260284,0.09521348226147294,8.839561304797324e-06,2.7515748570704356e-34
1897,"The Episcopal Church of Cherubim and Seraphim, Zion Pepe",43,Religious Group (v6),"The Episcopal Church of Cherubim and Seraphim, Zion Pepe was established on January 2, 1951 by a group predominantly made up of Ilaje men and women who lived or hailed from the Etikan and Aheri axis of Ilajeland. They had previously subscribed to the Cherubim and Seraphim Society which made its way into Ilajeland in 1929 and had continued to pursue their spiritual enlightenment with the Cherubim and Seraphim Church, Ugbonla from February 16, 1948 when that movement became distinct from the erstwhile Cherubim and Seraphim movement in Ilajeland. Worshippers at Ugbonla who travelled from Aheri and Etikan area of Ilajeland often had tortuous journeys to the community, They had to travel in dugout canoes for hours and at times in the rain. Apostle Theophilus Erejuwa Mafo, an associate of Saint Elisha Lene Ogunfeyimi then took it upon himself to establish another Zion community in the fringes of Etikan and Aheri. He moved to an uninhabited land (Zion Pepe) off his natal settlement of Ipepe to begin a new Zion which began to serve the spiritual enlightenment desire of C & S members in that area of Ilajeland. 


The church founded by Saint Mafo took up a hybrid name collapsing the nomenclature of the Episcopal church in his natal settlement with the C & S movement he was introducing there. Thus he tagged the church the Episcopal Church of Cherubim and Seraphim, Zion Pepe. The structure, operational guidelines, doctrines, beliefs and practices of the church are like those held by the C & S Zion, Ugbonla. However, the clerical order and titles of religious specialists in the community differ from those used in Ugbonla. As a theocratic settlement, the community holds religious meetings twice daily in the only religious house built and permitted within its borders. The religious specialists in the community daily bring the congregation inspiring sermons, songs in the spiritually charged atmosphere. The community’s annual conventions and anniversaries are moments of spiritual rejuvenation and revival. 


Compared to other theocratic communities in Ilajeland, Zion Pepe seems to have enjoyed more stable succession processes to the throne. Of the six Obas (monarchs) who have reigned in the community, only once was there some dispute in the process leading to the selection of the successor. The community also appears to be liberal when scouting for the a new Oba. They have brought prophets who were domiciled in branches of the church to lead the community while passing over some other powerful and eligible prophets in the headquarters. Zion Pepe continues to enjoy a stable spiritual atmosphere as it has also made considerable gains in their social and economic aspirations.",1951,2023,2040,1445,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,55,Julian Weideman,2023-08-02 16:11:58.067 +0200,2023-09-14 11:21:43.768 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.10289570404474999,0.0027358469064437934,0.7991461272260284,0.09521348226147294,8.839561304797324e-06,2.7515748570704356e-34

1904,الطريقة القادرية في تونس القرن  19 و20   =  L'ordre Qadiri en Tunisie aux XIXe et XXe siècles,43,Religious Group (v6),"L'ordre Qadiriyya est attribué au cheikh Abd al-Qadir al-Jilani.Cet ordre soufi est entré en Tunisie du vivant du cheikh Abd al-Qadir par l'un de ses élèves les plus importants, le cheikh Shuaib Ibn al-Hasan al-Andalusi, dit Abu Madian al-Ghawth. décédé en l'an 1197, à son retour du Hajj là-bas, où il rencontra le cheikh Abd al-Qadir Al-Qadir Al-Jilani et lui prit L'ordre Qadiriyya  .

Les livres de Cheikh Abd al-Qadir al-Jilani sont considérés comme la principale source dans le programme d'éducation spirituelle des disciples, mais il y a un détail simple qui est que les adeptes de la méthode Qadiriyya en Tunisie dépendent de l'école de jurisprudence Maliki comme le reste des Tunisiens, bien que l'école de jurisprudence de Sheikh Abdul Qadir soit l'école de pensée hanbalite.

1908,"Buddhist Traders in the Chinese Quarter in Hakata, Japan",43,Religious Group (v6),"The ""Chinese Quarter"" in Hakata, Japan, was a residential area that existed around 1100 - 1300 near Hakata Bay. The Chinese Quarter was home to hundreds of households, most of whom were Chinese merchants. Those merchants, although they took permanent residence in Hakata, traveled between China and Japan frequently. The majority of the merchants were probably from the southeast coast of China, where many prestigious Buddhist monasteries were located. Due to certain regulations issued by the Japanese government, Chinese merchants were not allowed to take long residence in Japan until the twelfth century, when Dazaifu, the Kyushu Headquarters, loosened its control of foreign visitors. The retreat of Dazaifu became an opportunity for the Chinese merchants to lay down roots in Japan. 
Many of the merchants were devoted Buddhist laymen. They frequently visited monasteries in both China and Japan and thus became crucial links between the continent and the archipelago. They donated to Buddhist monasteries in both China and Japan. The Tianyi Pavilion in Ningbo, China, has preserved three bricks that recorded the merchants from the ""Chinese Quarter"" (Tang fang 唐房) in Hakata made donations to pave a pilgrim road in Ningbo. The merchants also formed a close relationship with monks by providing transportation for the monks to cross the sea and serving as their messengers. Certain merchants even earned a position in Buddhist records. The Buddhist traders in the Chinese Quarter played an important role in spreading Zen Buddhism from China to Japan. 
Some wealthy merchants even helped to build the earliest Zen monasteries in Japan, right in the Chinese Quarter. Xie Guoming 謝國明 is a representative figure. He was originally from Hangzhou, China, and lived in the Chinese Quarter and married a Japanese woman. He built a Zen monastery, Jōtenji, in the Chinese Quarter and invited a famous monk, Enni Ben'en, to be the founding abbot. Enni had studied at the prestigious Jingshan monastery in Hangzhou, and the collaboration among Buddhist traders and Buddhist masters further consolidated the Buddhist and commercial connections between Kyushu and southeast China.
The Buddhist traders in the Chinese Quarter also adopted religious practices unique to Japan. For example, archaeological evidence shows that Chinese merchants built sutra mounds in the Hakata area, a practice to prepare for the coming of the Final Dharma, which was popular only in Japan.",1100,1300,2035,1479,Yiwen Li,45,Matthew Hamm,2023-08-09 08:47:21.919 +0200,2023-08-25 06:52:24.491 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.10289570404474999,0.0027358469064437934,0.7991461272260284,0.09521348226147294,8.839561304797324e-06,2.7515748570704356e-34

1940,"The Holy Apostles Community, Ori-Oke Iwamimo",43,Religious Group (v6),"The Holy Apostles Community, Ori-Oke Iwamimo was originally called ''The Maran Apostles community.'' It was known by this nomenclature for a little over two decades until it changed to its current name in 1972. Unlike the other dominant theocratic communities in Ilajeland which were started on virgin lands, Ori-Oke Iwamimo had been established by the father of Prophet Wilson Etan Ikudehinbo, the first leader of this theocratic community. Ikudehinbu was a former member of the Ayetoro theocratic community. He left Ayetoro due to some irreconcilable differences between himself and the monarch of Ayetoro in late 1950. By this time, the idea of theocratic settlements was becoming fashionable in Ilajeland due to the initial successes recorded by Ayetoro and Ugbonla. Ikudehinbu was therefore allowed to settle in Ori-Oke iwamimo and to propagate his faith in the manner he deemed fit. By 1951, the community became a theocratic settlement and was led by Ikudehinbu until August 2002 when he passed on. His son, Prophet Alebiosu has led the community since 2004. This was after the fierce leadership tussle which engulfed the community after Ikudehinbu’s demise had been apprehended. 

Ori-Oke Iwamimo community has been quite vibrant in their faith. Their mode of worship is like that found in other theocratic communities in Ilajeland, especially that of Ayetoro. However, they have also developed and maintained other distinct practices which stand them apart from their peers in the Ilaje littoral. Significant among their distinct practices maintained during the lifetime of the first Oba (monarch) is the special annual worship which held at the seashore beside the community church. During the performance of this ritual, the Oba invoked the sea. It is believed in the community that by some uncommon powers he causes the wave to rise and flood parts of the settlement. The Oba stands with his back to the sea while the congregation faces him. As the ritual gets under way, a big bowl is placed on a table in the glare of the people. When the water floods the arena, some of it is retained in the bowl. Special interventions are reported when the water leaps on the congregation. Before the ritual is ended, the water trapped in the bowl is sprinkled on the congregants. It is widely held in the community that the water sprinkled on participants is efficacious in bringing protection, good luck, healing and other favours to the congregants. 

Ori-Oke Iwamimo joins Ayetoro, Ugbonla and Zion Pepe to complete the list of the four most prosperous theocratic communities in Ilajeland. By a series of deliberate actions, the community lobbied the government of the Western State of Nigeria in the late 1960s and early 1970s to request the dredging of the canal which connects it and other villages to the Alape river. This was after it had previously conducted a manual dredging of the same canal with some successes. Ori-Oke Iwamimo remains the only theocratic community among the four most prominent in Ilajeland which has not adopted the use of prayer garments.",1950,2023,2044,1445,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,55,Julian Weideman,2023-08-20 22:24:54.659 +0200,2023-09-14 11:25:29.948 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.10289570404474999,0.0027358469064437934,0.7991461272260284,0.09521348226147294,8.839561304797324e-06,2.7515748570704356e-34

1958,The Apostolic Faith Mission in Zimbabwe,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Apostolic Faith Mission in Zimbabwe is a Pentecostal church. Pentecostalism has taken the world by storm and the Apostolic Faith Mission is among churches representing this movement. It is said to be the mother of Pentecostalism in Zimbabwe. Essentially, the church traces its history back to the Azusa experience in America which is believed gave birth to Pentecostalism. An American evangelist by the name John Graham Lake came to South Africa and started the Apostolic Faith Mission South Africa (AFMSA). Zimbabwean mine workers who were working in South Africa got attracted to this form of Christianity and then brought Pentecostalism to Zimbabwe. The Apostolic Faith Mission South Africa then sent some people to be in charge as the church grew. Paul Kruger is amongst the leaders who came from South Africa who played a great role in the establishment of the Apostolic Faith Mission in Zimbabwe. The Apostolic Faith Mission in Zimbabwe was under the administration of AFMSA for a number of years. The leadership was predominantly white during that time. When the leadership was finally handed over to the black Zimbabweans the church has had 4 presidents who were all male. Amongst the first converts were Chiumbu, Masembe, Mutemererwa, Kupara, Mugodhi, Mashavave and the Gwanzura brothers, John, Petros, Enoch and Ezekiel. These also played a big role in planting assemblies throughout the country and are highly regarded in the church even though they are all late. This church is heavily influenced by the patriarchal ideology such that the leadership is predominantly male. Male dominance is highly promoted both in church and at home. Men make decisions and women have to follow and obey. Men can be members of different church boards even if they are not pastors. Female pastors have never held the position of overseer or President (title for the top leader). The church was established in 1915 in Zimbabwe and women constitute the greatest number in terms of membership. Women are said to constitute 60% of the membership whilst men and children constitute the other 40%.The belief in the Holy spirit is central in the church and every member is expected to speak in tongues as evidence of being filled by the Holy spirit. When it was first established the church was characterized by healing and prophecy. This is one of the reason the church took long to be registered because the colonial government was skeptical of the practice of prophecy and miracle working. Amongst the prominent prophets in the early years were women. However as the years have gone by, prophecy and healing have become less practiced.",1915,2018,2058,1437,TERENCE MUPANGWA,57,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,2023-09-11 13:18:32.812 +0200,2024-03-22 11:36:37.110 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.5602649070983999,0.43957951091877095,1.3049285491479632e-10,5.840433057104982e-12,0.00015558184649571802,8.231207587688636e-20
1961,"Grace Covenant Centre, Ado-Ekiti",43,Religious Group (v6),"Grace Covenant Centre, Ado-Ekiti, Nigeria grew out of a Christian fellowship membered by some Christian staff of the then Ondo State University, Ado-Ekiti (OSUA) and other categories of civil servants who were resident in the town in the 1990s. The group initially held their meetings at the defunct Ajitadidun premises in the Adebayo area of the town before building their permanent site near their former meeting place. Before organizing this fellowship, the leader of the group, Pastor Felix Aderibigbe had successfully started and groomed the first Pentecostal Christian student fellowship in OSUA in 1984. Grace Covenant Centre was therefore the second Christian group organized by the visionary Christian leader who had previously been engaged in Christian fellowship leadership during his days as a student at the University of Ibadan, Nigeria. 

Being one of the first Pentecostal fellowships in the town, Grace Covenant Centre soon began to attract young, educated and upwardly mobile Christian professionals, businessmen and women and civil servants in Ado-Ekiti. The church which is known for building disciples of Jesus Christ has grown from its Adebayo assembly to open at least three other branches in Ado-Ekiti township. Besides, it has grown through its evangelistic outreach arm to set up a few other branches in other towns in Ekiti State. It also has a branch each in neighbouring Ondo and Ogun States. Being a church made up of academicians, technocrats and top executives in public and private sector, many of its branches are located near university campuses or membered by members of the academic community. It has also organised campus fellowships in universities and other tertiary institutions in Ado-Ekiti and other towns. The fellowship has grown to become one of the most popular Pentecostal movements in the city of Ado-Ekiti. 

The church organises several special programmes and annual conventions. It holds a summer prayer school in June of every year. In this programme, members are taught the principles of strategic prayers and exposed to certain underlying issues that must be addressed by Christians to be victorious in all their endeavours. At some point each year (mostly in February), it celebrates a jubilee crusade. This is a time for proclaiming liberty to those oppressed by sin, Satan and the world’s system. It celebrates its annual convention (Glory Conference) in the last full week of October. Members from the branches are encouraged to attend the annual convention which is usually power-packed. The church has built relationships with other Christian ministries and their leaders across the country. Leaders of such church ministries are often invited by the church to speak at their special programmes. As a faith community, the church emphasises love, fellowship and building strong horizontal and vertical relationships among members and with God through their Lord and saviour, Jesus Christ.",1990,2023,2064,1445,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,55,Julian Weideman,2023-09-12 13:53:27.561 +0200,2023-09-15 17:53:11.705 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.10289570404474999,0.0027358469064437934,0.7991461272260284,0.09521348226147294,8.839561304797324e-06,2.7515748570704356e-34
1966,Cherubim & Seraphim Movement Church (Worldwide) Ayo Ni O,43,Religious Group (v6),"Aladura is the word for “praying people”. The Aladura churches are independent African churches or African Instituted Churches (AICs) that emphasize prayer and healing. The Aladura Churches reflects the indigenization of Christianity through the use of African symbols, traditional healing modalities, and worship styles. The Aladura Churches offer solutions to existential problems plaguing humans unlike earlier churches whose emphasis is just the afterlife. The Christ Apostolic Church, the Cherubim and Seraphim, the Church of the Lord, and the Celestial Church of Christ have emerged as the significant arms of the Aladura movement.
The Cherubim and Seraphim Church, one of the Aladura churches, was co-founded by Moses Orimolade and Christiana Abiodun Emmanuel in 1925 through the Praying Band, which was then known as Egbe Aladura. Though a praying group in the first two years of its existence, the church was finally named in 1927.
There were different divisions that ravaged the church after the early years of its existence. Many divisions have taken place among the fold of the Cherubim and Seraphim after its first division in 1929 because of the unresolved differences that ensued between the founders. Even though there were many attempts made at uniting the various divided sections of the church, these attempts failed and had brought about many other factions instead. The church has disintegrated into so many factions, which are also having branches of their own. Also, these factions have their own ways of practices and mode of worship that are peculiar to them.
There are many independent brands of the church in and around Nigeria. This crisis situation of the church led to the forming of a body that is intended to reconcile the various factions and to have one unified Cherubim & Seraphim Church. Thus, the Cherubim and Seraphim Unification Church of Nigeria (C&SUCN) was born. The C&SUCN was founded as the body that intends to bring many of the factional bodies of the Cherubim and Society (C&S) together. It was formed in 1972. 
The C&SUCN took off with five (5) mother churches that include: Eternal Sacred Order of Cherubim & Seraphim; The Praying Band of the Sacred Society of Cherubim & Seraphim; Cherubim & Seraphim Society; The Sacred Cherubim & Seraphim Society; and the Holy Order of Cherubim & Seraphim Movement Church. The name of the section of the C&S Church, Holy Order of the Cherubim & Seraphim Movement Church, was changed to Cherubim & Seraphim Movement Church Worldwide Ayo Ni O.
Today, the Cherubim and Seraphim Movement Church (Worldwide) Ayo Ni O has 1750 branches, 105 districts, and 35 model church/parishes. The Most Senior Special Apostle Prophet Dr. Abiodun Adewale Abidoye JP was appointed as the Acting Spiritual Father and Chairman of Cherubim & Seraphim Movement Church Worldwide Ayo Ni O. The Cherubim & Seraphim Movement Church (Worldwide) Ayo Ni O is one of the five streams of churches under the umbrella all the Cherubim & Seraphim churches. 
And the Cherubim and Seraphim Movement Church (Worldwide) Ayo Ni O, is a significant section of the Cherubim and Seraphim movement which has its tentacles all over the world. The ecclesial practices and theology of the Cherubim and Seraphim Movement Worldwide Ayo Ni O have the same beliefs and practices in all its branches. Each city especially in Southwest Nigeria has a number of branches of this church. For instance, there are are six (6) identified and well-known branches of the Cherubim & Seraphim Movement Church, Ayo Ni O in Ibadan alone. The church is administered by leaders who operate mostly in the prophetic office. Visions, trances and other forms of divine communication between the divine and humans are encouraged among the membership of the church. This is because the practice encourages members of the church to live with confidence that they have fore knowledge of future events and so they do not live in fear of the unknown.",1972,2023,2075,1509,Samuel Okanlawon,57,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,2023-09-15 02:33:24.326 +0200,2024-05-28 23:09:54.013 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.10289570404474999,0.0027358469064437934,0.7991461272260284,0.09521348226147294,8.839561304797324e-06,2.7515748570704356e-34
1972,Shepherding Movement,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Shepherding Movement, aka Christian Growth Movement, was a sub movement within the larger Charismatic Movement during the 1970s and 1980s. It was founded by a group of US pastors dubbed the “Fort Lauderdale Five:” Don Basham, Bob Mumford, Derek Prince, Charles Simpson, and Ern Baxter. Believing that current churches and pastors were losing sight of the value of discipleship and were caving to worldly practices and cultures, the movement emphasized personal accountability and mentorship where adherents would submit themselves to a “shepherd.” Leaders in the movement required participants to attend additional life group meetings, usually in someone’s home, and to have shepherds, leaders, and elders approve all life decisions, including but not limited to: marriage, where to live, taking a new job or leaving a current job, or going to the doctor if ill. 
As the Shepherding Movement expanded throughout the United States, networks of communities began to emerge in the shape of a pyramid structure. The networks would meet locally in cell churches. Shepherds would have multiple disciples under them, and those shepherds would be under the authority of shepherds above them. These relationships became known as “covenant relationships” and the disciple was required to submit in all areas of life and tithe directly to the shepherd who would move the money up the authoritative structure. 
Leaders in the Pentecostal and Charismatic communities began to scrutinize the Shepherding Movement as the movement continued to grow and gain influence. Concerns about tithing to shepherds and the rigid structures of submission and of the covenant relationships were articulated by various pastors throughout the nation. Nationally recognized leaders such as Pat Robertson, Kathryn Khulman, and Demos Shakarian denounced the movement and distanced themselves from the founding leaders. 
By the 1980s, the movement began to fracture as the unity of the leaders disintegrated. Derek Prince and Bob Mumford publicly disassociated from the movement. In 1983, Derek Prince stated that the movement was an error. Bob Mumford publicly asked for forgiveness for his role in the movement in 1989. The movement waned during the 1990s and into the early 2000s as more adherents left the movement citing abuses from leadership. Due to the breakup of the founding leaders, there is little information as to how many adherents remain.",1970,2000,1131,762,Nathan Womack,5,Courtney Fitzsimmons,2023-09-20 23:56:06.385 +0200,2023-10-06 00:52:06.713 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.05722106101119321,0.00034797271176552775,5.597313596273358e-12,0.9423786018892849,5.2364382158968576e-05,6.0391814150919745e-33
1974,"Chapel of Grace, Ile-Ife",43,Religious Group (v6),"The Chapel of Grace, Ile-Ife started as a fellowship of Christian staff of the University of Ife Teaching Hospital now The Chapel of Grace, Ile-Ife started as a fellowship of Christian staff of the University of Ife Teaching Hospital now Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital, Ile-Ife. A group of the members of staff of the Teaching Hospital who began to meet to share their Christian faith and conviction decided to organise themselves into a fellowship in the late 1980s. In the early days of the fellowship, they got the leave of the hospital management to meet at a suitable venue within the engineering yard of the Ife hospital unit. From this venue they moved to their permanent site about fifty meters from the second gate of the Ife hospital unit of the hospital.

The church is led by a church council comprising of the senior pastor, other pastors, members of the deaconate, leaders of the various arms of the church as well as other eminent members of the Christian community in Ile-Ife. The council meets annually or when it becomes necessary to take important decisions for the progress of the church. Next to the church council is the pastoral board which meets more regularly to plan the activities of the church and provide leadership for the members. There are several activity groups within the church which members are encouraged to join to achieve the set goals for which the ministry was started.

Membership of the church comprises mainly of the working population of the hospital. The nature of the hospital is such that many of the staff undertake various training programmes to specialise in their desired field of medical and health practice. Many of these individuals worship at the Chapel of Grace during their training and relocate to other towns and cities to settle and practice as professionals. The church has had a highly mobile population over the years. Although several staff settle in permanent jobs in the hospital and continue in the church. They are joined by others who work outside the hospital community but are delighted to identify with the church. The church’s most celebrated annual programme is the ‘‘Power in the Word Conference’’. It is a programme where the word of God (the bible) is dissected and taught passionately. 

Other annual programmes which the church holds include Choir Anniversary, Blissful Home Seminar, a carol at Christmas and special programmes for children, youths, men and women respectively. Aside the annual programmes, the church meets every Sunday for the Sunday worship service and on Wednesday (weekly programme for bible exposition/teaching and prayers). The church holds a prayer vigil on the last Friday of the month as well as a prayer meeting before the commencement of work every Monday morning. The church in collaboration with the hospital community organises prayers a couple times each year specifically for the peace, progress and development of the hospital.",1989,2023,2072,1445,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,55,Julian Weideman,2023-09-22 19:45:38.434 +0200,2023-12-02 17:37:11.577 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.10289570404474999,0.0027358469064437934,0.7991461272260284,0.09521348226147294,8.839561304797324e-06,2.7515748570704356e-34
1983,Early Byzantine Asceticism,43,Religious Group (v6),"Holy men (θεῖος ἀνήρ, also called men, servants, friends or devotees of God) emerged in the East as early as Late Antiquity and the Early Byzantine period. These were individuals that were thought to have been specifically chosen by God so as to spread his word and make him and his intentions present and evident to their contemporaries. In order to come closer to him and gain virtue and purity, holy men abandoned their previous life and practiced repentance and self-mortification through prayer and ascetic labour. 

As they needed to be undistracted to achieve this intimacy with God, holy men withdrew in isolation and lived in social disengagement. This explains their emergence mostly in Syria, due to the area’s geography and climate. In the Syrian desert, as opposed to that of Egypt, these ascetics had the chance to dissociate themselves from the rest of the world and, at the same time, to survive in a relatively “friendly” environment, where they could more easily find adequate sources such as water and roots, even if they had to constantly be on the move. Consequently, they were able to completely cut themselves off from civilisation, while in the harsher landscape of Egypt they would have to carry with them, and then replicate, the well-known practices and habits of the nearby villages, making the contrast between the two worlds (that in a settled land and that in isolation) less apparent. So holy men left their cities, donated their possessions (which sometimes were many as some of them came from relatively wealthy families) to the poor, cut all ties with, and obligations towards, society, and started a new life without the support of family or friends. In addition, having reached a point where they did not have the same needs as other, “ordinary”, people even on a physical level, they also managed to live in the open or sometimes in natural shelters in the desert and other barren or abandoned places, fasting or eating only raw vegetables and roots, and, for long periods, staying sleepless and often with no clothes except for a simple shirt. Following this way of life was of course not always easy, and they had to strive in order to complete their mission. During their isolation, they spent their time praying, trying to support themselves by the work of their hands, exercising their body and trying to control the elements of nature as well as their own bodies and passions through hard training (askesis), mortification and voluntary suffering, which can be seen as imitating the passion of Christ, in an attempt to rise above their human existence. It should be noted, however, that holy men did not consider the body itself to be evil, and what they tried to overcome and work against were the human weaknesses. Finally, although not usually mentioned in our sources, the lives of some of them must have been seriously threatened and even lost while practicing asceticism. A substitute death, such as living in a grave-like enclosed space, nonetheless, was a sign of holiness and the ultimate proof that the holy man was now something more than an “ordinary” person and had moved beyond the normal human condition.   

Although holy men started their askesis by contemplating in isolation, the crowd played a significant part in their lives. Many people would follow them, become their disciples and often form groups or even structured communities with permanent facilities around them, while others would travel long distances to visit them as pilgrims and ask for their help. Ascetics themselves also paid visits to each other and sometimes to nearby villages or cities where they offered their help and, if necessary, they could get a few supplies in exchange for simple repairs. Furthermore, some of them were often asked by the official church to take on positions in the church hierarchy, which they seldom did and only temporarily. Holy men were always ready to participate in the daily life of common people and the social elite in order to protect and integrate that life. However, it was not uncommon for people to be suspicious of them and accuse them of fraud, sorcery and other serious crimes (e.g. murder), even of woes that the community would face in periods of crisis, and holy men had to try to allay them.

The crowd was an essential element in holy men’s lives for an additional reason. Despite their initial withdrawal from the society, after achieving sanctity they had to display signs of it, and the people were the audience they needed in order to exhibit their supernatural powers, as well as those who watched them closely, since they in fact expected to see the evidence that would prove the ascetics’ holiness. Moreover, since holy men sometimes depended on patrons and their gifts and donations, they had to perform miracles for their sake when they were asked to do so. Hagiographers used to place much emphasis on specific incidents from their protagonists’ lives in order to show their powers, such as blessing and cursing, praying or successfully interceding on behalf of their fellow citizens or even strangers who would ask for their help, and the power of prophecy. The most common sign, however, was that of healing, as holy men were thought to possess the ability to cure a variety of illnesses, both mental and physical. Most of the times they would pray for the sick person or visit them and cure them by touching them, while on other occasions they could send them one of their objects, which had acquired its owner’s supernatural powers. Furthermore, as many such stories were based on that of Christ from the Gospels, occasionally holy men were presented as bringing a dead person back to life. The relation between the two can also be seen in the second most often proof of the ascetics’ holiness, the conflict with devil. Holy men constantly had to deal with demons who stood in their way, and often had to heal people who had been possessed by such creatures by performing exorcisms. Their victory over these powers was certain, as they “represented” God, who had given them the ability to handle situations like that. The same is true for encounters with devil himself, who wanted to tempt holy men, distract them from their duties and prevent them from following an ascetic lifestyle. Usually he would do so by reminding them of their previous life they had left behind and all the sacrifices they had made, but the holy men were strong enough to resist him and, eventually, defeat him. 

Lastly, one should briefly also mention the role holy men played in society. The Syrian villages where they first emerged were, at the time, experiencing a decomposition of certain social institutions and a crisis of leadership, and were thus in need of a figure of authority. Therefore, for their inhabitants, holy men assumed the role of powerful rural patrons who would assist them in various aspects of their lives, both in everyday problems and in periods of crisis, while, at the same time, they were more accessible to them than actual patrons. As strangers who were not in any way related to the locals, they also played the role of objective mediators in rural life and sometimes even that of advisors, who reconciled and counselled villagers. Being at the centre of a prayer community as their spiritual fathers, they also offered petitions to God on their behalf, and these people, taking the holy men’s ascetic lifestyle into account, were assured that the latter were close to God and he would therefore hear their prayers. Of course holy men were also considered to be representatives of God, and were thus famous amongst people both in the countryside and in the cities, where they often acquired wealthy patrons themselves. These officials, members of the court or the army and even emperors, assisted and supported them in any way possible and contributed to the rise of their reputation, in exchange for the ascetics’ spiritual guidance and intercession with God. This relationship, as well as the one between holy men and the church authority, was not usually sought after by holy men themselves, who did not accept any offices. However, they gradually moved closer to the ecclesiastical hierarchy, and therefore they also started moving to Constantinople. Finally, it seems that sometimes holy men could work against authorities, namely the emperors, if the latter were usurpers or heretics, in which case the ascetics were regarded as a symbol of opposition to any kind of heresy. In any case, by overcoming their human existence and reaching the apogee of Christian morality, they soon became well-known and an essential part of everyday life in the Byzantine Empire.",400,600,2092,1383,Phoebe Georgiadi,49,Ian Randall,2023-10-05 21:35:22.632 +0200,2023-10-11 21:10:59.474 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.13453391105065346,0.0026489034633829264,0.5785440702559137,0.28331535808982056,0.000957757140229314,1.0057196616579351e-31
1989,Iron Age Celtic Spain and Portugal (Celtiberia),43,Religious Group (v6),"This entry pertains to Celtic language-speaking population groups in the Iberian peninsula, coterminous with modern-day Spain and Portugal. We know about the presence of Celtic tribes in the region from Classical writers, as well as linguistic research which provides us with a rich body of evidence. This consists of inscriptions, dedications, contracts etc., dating to the last three centuries BCE.

Additionally, there is evidence from place names, which are particularly helpful in distinguishing between Celtic-speaking peoples and those speaking other languages in and around the region. Archaeological evidence pertaining to settlement, burial, weapons, costumes and pottery also help us distinguish between Celtiberian culture and other Iron Age cultures of Spain and Portugal.

Settlement features included both round and rectangular houses, as well as fortified settlements with thick walls. Depending upon region and geography, the economy included herding and a variety of agricultural strategies based on the local environment. There were extensive cremation cemeteries, as well as round graves covered by cairns of stones.  Evidence of metallurgy exists in some areas, and grave goods included personal items, ornaments, and weapons of bronze and iron.

In terms of religion, in some areas there are votive inscriptions pertaining to local gods, quite a few of which can be readily identified as Celtic deities. These inscriptions provide information about indigenous gods and goddesses who were worshiped on hilltops, near bodies of water, and in relation to other sanctified features of the landscape. Small shrines are found in a number of locations, often with solar or celestial symbols. There is evidence for the veneration of local divinities, as well as some known in other contemporary Celtic regions.

Indigenous Celtiberian deities included the goddesses Boiogena (""Mother of Cattle""), Drusuna (whose name may signify a connection with the oak tree), Ataecina (possibly associated with night time and/or the underworld), Amma (a mother goddess), and the Duillae (who appear to be a female triad associated with foliage or trees).

Male deities included Arco, Vacocius, the Lattuerii (gods possibly associated with war); Teutates (an epithet seen in other Celtic regions, denoting ""the god of the tribe""); and the Duiris Ordaecis, whose name may contain the word for ""hammer"" (depictions of a hammer deity occur elsewhere in the ancient Celtic world, a symbol that may have to do with thunder, or powers of life and death).

Deities known to have been venerated in other Celtic cultural contexts included the widely-worshiped god Lugus (known in Gaul and other locations, whose name appears to be cognate with that of the multi-skilled Irish god Lug); Epona (a widely worshiped goddess in the ancient Celtic world, associated with horses, fertility, and journeys to the afterlife or Otherworld); Bormanus (also venerated at thermal springs and sanctuaries in Gaul); and Nemedus (whose name contains the root word ""nemed / nemet"" meaning ""sacred place"", variants of which occur in other Celtic regions).

One of the most unique features of Celtiberian artwork pertaining to the physical expression of religious ideology are large granite sculptures in the shape of boars and bulls, known as ""verracos"". These appear to have played an important role in the religion of the pre-Roman population. Representations of human heads, a symbol found widely throughout the Celtic-speaking Iron Age world is one of many important symbols connecting these cultures with others on the Continent and in Ireland and Britain. These also include representations of birds, animals, and fish; plant motifs; solar and lunar motifs; and triplism pertaining to deities or religious symbols.

Life-size stone figures armed with round shields and daggers are found near some fortified settlements. Referred to as ""guerreros galaicos"", they are often depicted wearing neck rings known as torques. These ornaments have been found in the archaeological record, consisting of heavy gold penannular rings with various types of decoration on their terminals, including horsemen; solar barques; animals, birds and other important religious symbols and ideological elements.",-600,300,2096,739,Sharon Paice MacLeod,50,Andrew Danielson,2023-10-11 21:36:07.966 +0200,2023-12-19 23:53:49.947 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.44946062907144463,0.4354095597640029,2.711662321013768e-11,0.1026539877366284,0.012474664890446205,1.1585103612332113e-06

In the Homeric 'Catalogue of Ships' the region was divided into two regions, one called Boeotia and the other referred to as Minyan. The people of the region fit into the definition of Greek identity. The main deity of the Boeotians was Athena Itonia, who was worshipped at Coronea, as well as Zeus; the two became the chief deities of the region in the Hellenistic period. There were also a series of related cults to Apollo across the region, located at Mount Ptoion (this is also where epigraphic evidence shows the first mentions of the group's name), the Ismenion in Thebes, Telphousa west of Haliartos, Mount Thourion near Chaeronea, Tegyra near Orchomenos, and the sanctuary of Trophonius, who is some times a son of Apollo in ancient genealogies (Schachter [1967]).

1994,Nigeria Fellowship of Evangelical Students (NIFES),43,Religious Group (v6),"The Nigeria Fellowship of Evangelical Students (NIFES) is an interdenominational Christian movement established in 1968 to cater for the spiritual needs of Christian students in Nigeria's tertiary educational institutions. The body is affiliated to the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students (IFES) and is acclaimed to have affected several hundred lives across the nation. NIFES has established its unit fellowships on several campuses including Universities, Polytechnics and Colleges of Education spread across the six geo-political zones of the country. The group builds disciples, trains and explores the potentials in the young folks who choose to identify with them. NIFES prides itself as an organisation that is in the habit of building tomorrow’s leaders today.

NIFES focuses on evangelism and discipleship. They do this by encouraging members to take part in programmes geared towards soul-winning and disciple-building. At the apex of the group’s organogram is a Board of Trustees which includes eminent personalities in the nation’s Christian circle. The group is led by a National Director who coordinates the day-to-day activities of the organization. 

NIFES is structured into sub-zones and zones for easy administration. Each zone is coordinated by the Training Secretary who constantly visits campuses in their area ensuring they keep up with the ministry’s cardinal programmes at all times. Each NIFES campus unit is governed by a student executive council elected by the local congregation under the supervision of the Training Secretary. Due to the nature of the group, it is necessary to have change of student executive yearly. This is because while some graduate, others would need to change executive positions and serve in other roles before they also exit the campus at their own time. 

The campus/unit Executive report to the Training Secretary who in turn makes report of the campus fellowships in their area to the regional/national leadership. They hold national programmes at the NIFES National Campgrounds in Kwali, in the outskirts of Abuja, Nigeria’s Federal Capital Territory. 
To meet her financial obligations, the fellowship relies on funding received from offertory collections taken during fellowship meetings as well as from friends, patrons and other free-will offerings from other categories of people. 
Since the fellowship was one of the first campus Christian groups to appear in Nigeria, it has served generations of students for close to six decades. Many old-time members of the group recommend them to their children, wards, relations and friends who are newly admitted to Nigerian tertiary educational institutions. As a result, the fellowship thrives on a reputation and standard it has built over the years.",1968,2023,1082,1445,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,55,Julian Weideman,2023-10-25 12:31:21.987 +0200,2023-11-15 00:55:38.112 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.10289570404474999,0.0027358469064437934,0.7991461272260284,0.09521348226147294,8.839561304797324e-06,2.7515748570704356e-34
2000,"The Community Church of Apostles Nigeria and Oversea (COCANO), Ajegunle",43,Religious Group (v6),"In 1933, the Community Church of Apostles Nigeria and Oversea (COCANO) separated from the rapidly growing Aladura movement, a stock of the Cherubim and Seraphim Society introduced to Ilajeland in 1929. The members of the C & S movement in Ilajeland during this period were highly mobile holding their conventions across the towns and villages in Ilajeland. In 1933, they had attended a convention in Ereke. While most members returned to their communities, a group stayed back at the convention venue, making it their home with the intention of continuing there permanently.

The group continued there until a time when the establishment of theocratic communities in Ilajeland gained currency. At this time, they decided to move to the natal town of the group’s premier leader where enough provision had been made to accommodate them. Their relocation to Ajegunle follows the pattern of Wilson Eran Ikudehinbu who left Ayetoro for former Maran Apostles now Ori-Oke Iwamimo and Lot Korollo who also led his group from his former church location to merge his Christian group with his natal community of Oropo about two miles west of Mahin. 

At Ajegunle, the COCANO has continued to advance their beliefs as its spiritual fervour has had significant impact on the local community. The church holds its conventions, anniversaries and other special programmes in the community boosting local trade and businesses. It advances the global picture of Ajegunle and has continued to place the town on the public stage as the host community of the Christian group. The church has had its fair share of the succession debacle which has plagued most of the theocratic communities in Ilajeland but has found a way to overcome the challenges posed by this widespread problem.  

As with most of the other theocratic communities in Ilajeland, COCANO is organised along several bands for easy coordination and administration. The church appoints leaders for each band. The band leadership is responsible to the Oba (monarch) and the church council for the activities of the group and welfare of her members.

2003,Nigerian Baptist Convention,43,Religious Group (v6),"This entry about the Nigerian Baptist Convention (NBC), a Christian denomination (evangelical protestant) which began with membership in South-Western part of Nigeria and has since spread to the North Central, North Western, North Eastern, South-Southern and South-Eastern Part of the country. The group is divided into at least 35 Baptist Conferences across all the 6 geopolitical zones in the country with several sub-divisions referred to as Baptist Associations. These Baptist Conferences and Associations are spread across all the states in the country. The Nigerian Baptist Convention began in 1914 with the appellation “Yoruba Baptist Association” which later metamorphosed into the Nigerian Baptist Convention. Although the Convention has its largest membership in South-Western Nigerian states (Such as Oyo, Osun, Lagos, Ogun, Ondo and Ekiti States); large membership are still recorded in the South-Southern and Northern regions (such as Delta, Edo, Rivers, Kaduna, Plateau, Niger and Kogi States). There are over 13,000 local congregations that makes up the Nigerian Baptist Convention.  The Nigerian Baptist Convention has extended her mission efforts beyond the shore of Nigeria to countries like Cote D’Ivoire, Benin Republic and the United Kingdom. The Nigerian Baptist Convention is committed to theological education with at least 10 theological institutions for the training of gospel ministers. Her commitment to secular education is also evidence in the presence of hundreds of Baptist primary and secondary schools all over the country (owned by the Convention, the Conferences, Associations and local churches). The Schools of Nursing and the Bowen University owned by the denomination provides tertiary education in different academic fields. There are at least 10 medical facilities owned by the Nigerian Baptist Convention spread across the country that provides medical services for people. The Nigerian Baptist Convention believes in the following distinctive: the Bible as sole authority for faith and practice, autonomy of the local church, priesthood of all believers, baptism and the Lord’s supper as the two ordinances of the church, individual soul competency, separation of church and state, the office of pastor and deacon as the two recognized offices of the denomination. The Denomination is a member of a larger Christian body in Nigeria referred to as Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN).  The denomination has a worshiping community of over 8 million people making it the second largest Baptist Convention Affiliating with the Baptist World Alliance.

2006,New Life for All Nations Ministries,43,Religious Group (v6),"New Life for all Nations Ministries is a product of a massive evangelistic push in villages, towns and cities in southwest Nigeria in the early to mid 1970s. The evangelistic work which produced the church was spearheaded by an itinerant preacher by the name, J.K Solomon. Evangelist Solomon had previously been a Police officer in the Nigerian Police Force. He however heeded the call to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ to all nations. He was supported by a band of young and enthusiastic evangelists in the evangelistic campaigns. Together, they travelled across major towns in western Nigeria to preach the gospel and disciple those who accepted their message. They then planted churches in these towns, leaving behind one or a few members of their team to help groom the converts. When members of the newly established church became stable in faith, they also began to launch out to their surroundings to evangelise and further expand the membership of the church. 
The church has its headquarters in Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria from where its branches are coordinated for effective implementation of the church mandate. The vision of the church includes; 
1.	To take the gospel of Jesus Christ to every nation of the world
2.	To plant New Testament churches in every nation and
3.	To disciple the reached for the purpose of reaching un-reached. 

To fulfil its mandate, the church relies on members to engage in personal evangelism as it also organises and conducts mass evangelistic campaigns. It also engages the mass media, new media and other outlets to propagate the gospel. A number of other tools aside evangelism are deployed to ensure the church continues on the path of actualising its dreams. These tools include in-depth study of the scriptures, prayers and other fellowship programs. The church Mission and Pastoral Institute provides training for ministers and missionaries who are designated to lead church branches or those being sent out as missionaries to new or existing missions fields. 

As a means of fulfilling its vision the church holds annual conventions where members from the various branches come together in corporate fellowship to reinforce their collective beliefs and encourage one another unto the burden they all willingly bear. During such periods, the general congregation of the church engages in corporate mission outreach, workshops and specialised seminars which are all targeted towards renewing their resolve and engagement for evangelism (soul-winning). Constitutionally, the term of office of the President or General Overseer is tenured. They have succeeded in having peaceful transition from one leader to the other. The leaders claim that position is a privilege and so should not become a subject of quarrel or strive. They appear to be committed to fulfilling the evangelism mandate they set for themselves above the quest for occupying offices. As a result of their evangelistic drive, the church now has branches in many anglophone and francophone countries in West Africa, Europe and the Americas.",1972,2023,2118,1445,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,55,Julian Weideman,2023-10-30 14:16:32.188 +0100,2023-11-11 16:50:31.559 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.10289570404474999,0.0027358469064437934,0.7991461272260284,0.09521348226147294,8.839561304797324e-06,2.7515748570704356e-34

Until the fourth century they did not have a strong connection to the rest of the Hellens through genealogical connections.

2011,Scripture Union Nigeria,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Scripture Union (SU), an interdenominational and non-denominational Christian organization made inroads into Nigeria on January 1, 1885. It was introduced into the country by the Christian Missionary Society (CMS) missionary, Reverend Gollman. He was serving at the Wesley Chapel, Tinubu area of Lagos when he organized the group in the country. Although the group had been created to cater for children who had no access to the church on 2nd June, 1867, it has spread to more than 130 countries across all continents of the world with over 42 of such countries on the African continent.

Rev. Gollman started the Scripture Union in Nigeria with 204 children and continued to grow the membership of the group. However, Christian association was not officially registered in Nigeria until 9th October 1967, a hundred years after the group was originally founded in London by Mr. Josiah Spiers. Since its introduction to Nigeria, the group has influenced several hundreds of children and youths for Christ. The group promotes evangelism and a culture of bible reading among young people and Christian families. The group organises leadership training for churches and schools as well as holiday camps for children and youths. It has made appreciable impact on children of school age through the relentless effort of school visits. 

The group has registered its presence on campuses of tertiary educational institutions in Nigeria through the Scripture Union Campus Fellowship (SUCF). It seeks to both continue the unfinished work of helping young folks they encountered in primary and secondary schools across Nigeria cement their relationship with Christ as well as opening up a fresh opportunity to those who have not encountered them previously. The Scripture Union holds tenaciously to its mission statement which is … ‘‘to reach children, young people and families, nurturing them through bible engagement to become committed Christians of influence’’.

Through its devotional guide translated into several local languages in Nigeria, the group has affected children, young people and families, enriching their spirits with the moral teachings of the bible. It has helped in moulding many prominent Christian leaders in Nigeria today through the encounters they had with the group in their formative years. The group strives to initiate multiple streams of revival in the life of every inhabitant of the earth. It considers as its most important duty, the reconciliation of men to God so that God’s peace could ravage every soul, transforming the souls to an enduring home for God where the fragrance of God’s love and grace emanates to the dying and depraved world.",1885,2023,1082,1445,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,55,Julian Weideman,2023-11-03 14:40:24.462 +0100,2023-11-14 07:46:13.809 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.10289570404474999,0.0027358469064437934,0.7991461272260284,0.09521348226147294,8.839561304797324e-06,2.7515748570704356e-34

2021,The United Missionary Church of Africa,43,Religious Group (v6),"United Missionary Church of Africa (UMCA) is a Mennonite denomination that arrived in Nigeria in 1905.  The founding missionaries, whose society is known as United Missionary Society (UMS) came from the United States of America and Canada in the first half of the twentieth century.  Their home church was known as the United Missionary Church (UMC). UMC was initially known as Mennonite Brethren in Christ (MBC). Apart from its Mennonite background, the denomination was also heavily influenced by Methodism. The first missionary in Nigeria was Rev. A.W. Banfield who arrived in Nigeria in 1905.  He was well-known for reducing the Nupe language to writing, publication of Nupe Dictionary and the translation of the Bible into Nupe language.  Other missionaries such as L.R. Sloat, W. Bontrager, G. Schroeder, J. McDowell, L.K. Fuller,  and many others also joined Banfield in planting the denomination in Nigeria. The activities of the missionaries was not limited to preaching the gospel, it also included healthcare and education.  The denomination however, is well-known through its major Seminary, the UMCA Theological College, Ilorin, which trains clergy, not only from the owner denomination, but from all Protestant churches, including those from African independent churches.  Apart from Nigeria, the UMS also established churches in countries of Central America, South America and Asia
The labours of the UMC missionaries in Nigeria resulted in the United Missionary Church of Africa becoming a distinct denomination in the country in 1955. On September 29, 1956, the denomination became a registered corporate body in Nigeria.  With the support of indigenous missionaries, the denomination spread from central Nigeria to the North west and South western Nigeria.  Today the Church is well established in ten states of the thirty six states in Nigeria, including, Lagos, Oyo, Osun, Kwara, Niger, Kogi, Kebbi, Kaduna, Plateau and Nasarawa States.  UMCA can also be found in some other African countries, such as Sierra Leone, Liberia and Cote D’Ivoire.  The UMS handed the running of the denomination to indigenous leaders on January 5, 1978 in a service held at the Theological College, in Ilorin.
The national leader of the denomination is titled the President, who is elected every four years.  A president can use two terms of four years each; thus a President cannot spend more than eight years in office.  The regional leaders are called Church District Superintendent (CDS).  At present (2023) the church has thirty four (34) Church District Superintendents, in ten states of Nigeria.  The District Superintendents are also elected for a term of four years, renewable for another term.  Under the District Superintendents are the Area Church Councils (ACC), and then the local Churches.  Apart from the Offices, there are standing committees and Boards, overseeing the different aspects of the denomination’s activities.

2027,Hizb-ut-Tahrir,43,Religious Group (v6),"Strongly linked to the political thought of the Palestinian intellectual Taqi al-Din al-Nabhani, Hizb-ut-Tahrir originated in the early 1950s between Palestine and Jordan. In the turbulent post-Second World War Middle East, al-Nabhani identified the structural causes of the Arab world's crisis -manifestly evident in the Nakba and the foundation of the Israeli state- in secular Arab politics and invoked the foundation of a group or party actively pursuing the restoration of the Islamic Caliphate. Hizb-ut-Tahrir is now present in the Middle East and North Africa. Since the mid-1970s, it has also been rooted in Southeast East and Central Asia, as well as in Britain, Germany, and Austria. Despite such internationalization, the movement has never gained substantial political weight anywhere due to its uncompromising rhetoric and refusal of democratic means. It is currently banned in most Arab and non-Arab countries, for it is hard to determine the actual size of the movement globally or in the national branches. Al-Nabhani remained the uncontested leader of the group until he died in 1977, followed by Abdul Qadeem Zallum until 2003 and Ata Abu Rashta since then.
Typifying Hizb-ut-Tahrir in a clear-cut analytical category is problematic since, despite its self-representation as a proper party, al-Nabhani indifferently used the Arabic term 'kutla' -group- and 'hizb' -party- in interpreting the Quran's relevant sections. Still, in the movement's conceptual backbone, the notion of ""hizb"" did not have a pejorative meaning as in antecedent Islamic reformists' understanding who, instead, rebuffed political parties as being a byproduct of Western Modernity. 
Historically, Hizb-ut-Tahrir is a clear byproduct of the XX century's Middle Eastern sociopolitical evolutions. It profoundly resented from both the interwar period and the immediate post-colonial decades. From the latter, distinctly came a vocal anti-colonialism directed against local Arab regimes culpable of having adopted Western forms of government. From the first, al-Nabhani drew inspiration for setting up pyramidal structures and rigid modes of action that closely featured the Syrian and Iraqi Ba'ath parties. In any society in which it is present, Hizb-ut-Tahrir's actions follow a well-detailed five-step strategy designed by al-Nabhani himself. In the panorama of local and coeval Islamist political activism, Hizb-ut-Tahrir represented a sort of 'third way' between classic Islamic modernist groups, namely the Muslim Brotherhood, and radical Islamism, palpably gaining momentum after Sayyd Qutb. Contrary to Hassan al-Banna's organization, al-Nabhani preferred very rigid political activism to grassroots organizations, always rejected democratic participation and refused a ""gradualist"" approach in favour of a revolutionary rupture as for Qutb. However, opposed to Qutbism, Hizb-ut-Tahrir never endorsed the notion of ""jahiliyya"" and rejected violent jihadi practices. Al-Nabhani's thought largely remained non-violent, advocating for an intellectual revival of ordinary people instead. Much of Hizb-ut-Tahrir's activities consist of study-circles for the indoctrination of novices and the creation of an intellectual vanguard to make proselytism in society. The restoration of the Caliphate would be consequential to these steps in the movement's vision. 
Besides clandestinity and state repression, Hizb-ut-Tahrir failed to gain political weight for internal reasons. First, the very rigid structure reduced adaptation capacity in ever-moving sociopolitical scenarios. Second, the proposal of an ideological reformation limited the ability to compete with other political groups endorsing more practical solutions to people's everyday needs, such as Hamas, the Muslim Brotherhood, or Jama'at al-Islamyya in Southeast Asia. Third, the will to recruit only heavily educated candidates who previously passed through an intense period of indoctrination further restrained the members' size.",1953,2023,2124,1516,Michele Benazzo,55,Julian Weideman,2023-11-18 13:45:15.684 +0100,2023-11-21 13:14:59.908 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.1260666023517078,0.0026586257021786845,0.7355090202515056,0.13556990717930117,0.00019584451530677124,2.5014109832965167e-33

2038,"Cathars, Catharism, Albigenses, Albigensians, Cathari, Catharistae, ""Pure Christians""",43,Religious Group (v6),"The Cathars were a heterogeneous heretical sect in medieval Europe. The groups and their beliefs have been identified by various names (Cathars, Catharism, Albigenses, Albigensians, Cathari, Catharistae) and the heresy is identified with different groups across history. The term was used in the Late Antiquity to refer to various heresies: ""Cathari"" was used of the Novatianists by Saint Epiphanius and other Greek Fathers, while Augustine used the term ""Catharistae"" to describe a sect of Manichaeans. The term primarily applies to a collection of groups in medieval Europe (12th to 14th centuries) that espoused a gnostic and dualist system of belief that was regarded as heresy by mainstream Christianity in the medieval West (Roman Catholicism) where these beliefs can be traced. The group referred to itself, at times, as ""Pure Christians"". The sect is also referred to as the “Albigensians” or “Albigenses” (after Albi in southern France).

The dualist belief system of Catharism centred on the idea of two eternal and coeval divinities, gods, forces or principles: one good and one evil. Spirits are created by the good and matter by the evil principle. When spirits fell from goodness, they were imprisoned in bodies and in death moved from one to another until their badness was expiated and they could return to heaven. The Cathars rejected the organised Church, its authority, its sacraments, and its interpretation of scripture. The group was extremely strict in its religious practices: rejected marriage, the consumption and use of meat and animal products, and recommended an extreme form of fasting (“endura”) that led to starvation and death. They believed that Christ was an angel with a non-physical body, that He did not suffer and die, and that His redemptive act was to spread the true (Albigensian) doctrine. They lived in two religious casts: a more austere group, the “perfect”, who received their baptism (“consolamentum”) by the laying on of hands by which members recipients became the ""perfecti"", and the ordinary believers who would receive “consolamentum” before dying. 

The belief system was based around Christianity, but also incorporated ideas from  different Christian heretical sects including Sabellianism and Arianism. Similarities of belief can be seen with a number with a number of other heresies with which the group was frequently linked. Catharism was influenced by the Bogomils, a comparable Eastern gnostic dualist sect that emerged in the first Bulgarian empire in the 10th century. Catharism may have developed in Byzantium under influence from Armenia and Persia. Catharism emerged in Germany in the 12th century and also in Italy, primarily in the region of Milan. They appeared in the Languedoc region of France around Albi in the 11th century and were also to be found in the Champagne region. Thirteen clerics were condemned to death at the Council of Orléans in 1022. A crusade and later inquisition was launched in the early 13th century and all traces of Cathars had been expunged by the 14th century.",1000,1300,2138,1422,John Gallagher,49,Ian Randall,2023-11-22 22:54:42.992 +0100,2023-11-26 03:31:38.584 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.1504214583262771,0.0031111489469894974,0.6008924567167981,0.242304754933633,0.0032701810763022202,7.240700163934029e-30
2051,Tibeto-Vietnamese Đạo Mẫu,43,Religious Group (v6),"This entry explores a modern syncretic Đạo Mẫu that is mixed with Tibetan elements, which we call Tibeto-Vietnamese Đạo Mẫu. While many elements are shared and generalizable about Đạo Mẫu more broadly, this entry is restricted mostly to specific elements that reflect the integration of Tibetan Buddhism, specifically the Sakya lineage (since its introduction in Vietnam in the 1990s). Of key interest is the transposition of Tibetan deities onto a Vietnamese goddess cosmology within a Tibetan ritual space. This is arguably (and likely) the only ethnographic example of this in Vietnam (and probably the world). Tibeto-Vietnamese Đạo Mẫu emerges from a much longer history of folk religious practice (tín ngưỡng dân gian) of worshipping mother goddesses, based on Vietnamese oral traditions, legends, folk songs and popular stories. Tibeto-Vietnamese Đạo Mẫu is a complex pantheistic belief system that syncretizes both Mahayana and Tibetan Buddhism, Daoism, Confucianism and ethnic minority religious practices, and reflects the preservation of indigenous Vietnamese culture and heritage. It stems from an older tradition for which there is no consensus about the exact date of (16th century is conventionally given). Mother goddesses are spirit deities derived from different ethnic minorities and historical figures, including those who fought to protect the country from military and political invasion, and are present in both Tibetan Buddhism and conventional Đạo Mẫu. Tibeto-Vietnamese Đạo Mẫu is organized in a way congruent with larger expressions across Vietnam.  There is a supreme high god, Thánh Mẫu (Mother Goddesses), sometimes supervised by Ngọc Hoàng (Jade Emperor) or Phật Bà Quan Âm (Avalokiteshvara). Each holy mother is a ruler of a realm (called ‘prefecture’ or phủ). There are four phủ comprising the universe: Thiên phủ (Prefecture of Heaven), Địa phủ (Prefecture of Earth), Thoải phủ (Prefecture of Water) and Nhạc phủ (Prefecture of Mountains and Forests). The highest level of Tibeto-Vietnamese Đạo Mẫu's pantheon (hàng chư thiên) is Quân Âm (Guan Yin) depicted in female form. The second level are the four heavenly fathers (tứ vị vua cha), followed by three or four palaces of mother goddesses. Below the mother goddesses are great mandarins (quan lớn đệ), princesses (thánh chầu), princes (thánh hoàng), thánh cô (saintly ladies), and thánh cậu (boy attendants). Lên đồng is the iconic mediumship ceremony associated with Vietnamese folk rituals, including Tibeto-Vietnamese Đạo Mẫu, that incorporates singing and dancing while channeling a series of supernatural beings into the medium’s physical body. It brings alive mythical and historical personages, such as Trần Hưng Đạo, a military general who fought and protected the country from the Mongol invasions in the 13th century. As our analysis extends, Tibeto-Vietnamese Đạo Mẫu is a contemporary example of gender fluid mediumship, a phenomenon which has been widely analyzed by anthropologists in other ethnographic domains.

Christ Way Ministries International (CWMI) is more prevalent in the Southwestern part of Nigeria but there are scattered branches in the Midwestern Nigeria and a new branch in Australia. There are diaspora members in the United States of America, the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, and Canada.  
A brief background history of the Hospital Christian Fellowship that led to the formation of Christ Way Church is in order. Hospital Christian Fellowship began as a result of the activities of some young Christian graduates from Universities in Nigeria in the middle of the 1970s, who found jobs in the teaching hospital, and began a fellowship group in Ilé-Ifè. This fellowship group, which started specifically in 1976, comprised of young people from various denominations (Anglican, Baptist, and Methodist,), who were mainly hospital workers in Ilé-Ifè. Their goal was to meet and discuss the Bible and evangelize their immediate hospital environment. The names of these young graduates at that time are: Bádé Nwakpa (a Pharmacist), Niyi Arówólò (an Engineer), Philip O. Ògúnnówò (a Medical Doctor), Christopher Òpápéjú (a Secondary School teacher) and his wife OpéOlúwa Òpápéjú (a hospital secretarial staff) and finally Uche Onwudiegu (a Medical Doctor). At its initial stage, the group adopted a rotational presidency. Niyi Arówólò was the first president; at the expiry of his tenure, Philip O. Ògúnnówò took over from him and was the president until when Samuel Odúnlámì Oríòkè joined the group in 1983. In October, 1983, Odúnlámì Oríòkè took over as the president after a three-day fast and he maintained the position until 1992 when the fellowship changed its status to a Church. 
The hospital group met for their fellowship activities on the premises of the Seventh Day Adventist (henceforth SDA) Hospital, which the Federal Government acquired from the SDA mission and made an extension of the Ife University Teaching Hospital Complex (IUTHC), to train medical students. The group met on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Tuesdays were for Bible study, while Thursdays were for prayer meetings. The fellowship was meeting inside one of the School of Nursing’s classrooms. When the classroom was in use by the School of Nursing, the fellowship group often moved to other available venues, such as the General Outpatient Department (GOPD) or the corridor of the Hospital Laboratory Department. During the early days of the meetings, the hospital management did not oppose the activities of the members of the group nor did they interfere with their meetings, until the group grew. 
Until Odúnlámì Oríòkè joined in 1983, the Hospital Christian Fellowship (HCF) had just a few members, no more than 15 in all. By the time he joined the group, he introduced radical evangelism within and outside the hospital premises. What is meant by radical evangelism here is the use of different methods such as tract distribution (especially Four Spiritual Laws), bus evangelism, and drama evangelism and so on, to present the gospel to the people. Evangelism was no longer confined to the four walls of the hospital; coupled with bed-to-bed hospital evangelism, there was the house-to-house evangelism, which took the group out of the hospital premises into the community around the hospital. 
Some members of the SDA church became members of the fellowship. This was the beginning of the travail of the fellowship, because the SDA Church’s council rose up and in fact instigated the hospital management to take a stand against the fellowship. The leaders of the fellowship at the time who were also medical doctors in the same hospital pleaded with the hospital management. The matter dragged on until the end of 1986 when the fellowship was eventually kicked out of the hospital premises. 
Some of the members who were head teachers at the SDA Grammar School (High School) gave the leadership of the fellowship permission to use the school’s classrooms for its weekly activities. In 1988, when the Federal Government of Nigeria returned back the hospital and the school initially taken from them,   the SDA church council served the Fellowship with a note to vacate the premises. This meant that the group was going to lose its identity by striking out the phrase, “Hospital Christian,” from its name. When the fellowship moved from the hospital premises to the school premises, many non-hospital workers, such as Akin Ìgè, T.O. Oyèbísí, Túndé Okùnadé, and other influential individuals, had joined the group and also occupied leadership positions of the fellowship. Some members of the fellowship who belonged to the Methodist Church of Nigeria, Obalùfòn, Ilé-Ifè, appealed to their church’s council to grant permission for the fellowship to hold its weekly meetings on Methodist property. The Church Council granted temporary permission in 1988. The fellowship changed its name to Christ Way Fellowship (CWF) at the end of the year 1988.  Because the permission granted the fellowship was not stipulated in writing, some members of the Methodist Church who felt threatened by the activities of the fellowship complained about the inconvenience created by the CWF.
The CWF moved out of the Methodist Church at the end of 1989 and established its home where its present headquarters is located at Temipemi Street, Iredapo Quarters, Ilé-Ifè. The place is a three-acre land with an old church and an uncompleted apartment complex within it. The place was bought from its original owner, who was also using it for the church’s activities. The fellowship leaders, having purchased this property where fellowship activities could be held without any hindrance, began to operate as a pseudo-church. I use the word pseudo here because the organization had already been operating as a church without any official recognition by the Federal Government of Nigeria. Fellowship activities were no longer restricted to two days of the week, but were extended to about four days, namely Mondays, Prayer Meetings; Tuesdays, Bible Study; Thursdays, Deliverance Hour, and Sundays, Home Cell leaders’ meetings (House Fellowship). Home Cell was already a part of the programs of the HCF when they met at the hospital premises. Seeing all these kinds of activities, many church leaders in the town of Ilé-Ifè had begun to insinuate that Odún Oríòkè, the leader of the CWF, was already nursing the ambition to start a church. Maybe they were correct, as events that led to the formation of the church confirmed what the public and some members of the Orthodox churches had already suspected.",1992,2023,2147,1533,Enoch Gbadegesin,57,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,2023-12-06 11:47:21.171 +0100,2024-01-24 19:15:13.646 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.10289570404474999,0.0027358469064437934,0.7991461272260284,0.09521348226147294,8.839561304797324e-06,2.7515748570704356e-34
2054,Christ Apostolic Church,43,Religious Group (v6),"The church, Christ Apostolic Church is reputed to be the first Pentecostal church to have emerged from the shore of Nigeria. The church  was started through the effort of individuals who desire apostolic power and reawakening of the church like the biblical apostolic age. Prominent among the pioneers of the church are Oba/Pastor Isaac Akinyele, Pastor David Ogunleye Odubanjo, Joseph Sadare, Miss Sophia Odunlami and Evangelist Joseph Ayo Babalola. These men and women were part of the individuals who laid the foundation of what is today known as Christ Apostolic Church.  Beginning from  the Church missionary society of Our Saviours' Anglican church in Ijebu Ode in 1918, a group of people formed a prayer society called  ""Egbe Aladura"" meaning prayer society/group. This prayer society/group spearheaded by Joseph B. Sadare was forced to move out of the Anglican church as her practices  were considered antithetical to the doctrine of Anglican  church.  In the year 1930, there was an outbreak of revival through Evangelist Joseph Ayo Babalola in Oke Oye Ilesha. This revival signaled a new era for the group as large number of people joined them as members. .As this  revival attracted a large number of people to the group, it also attracted persecution for them from the mission church and government. However, the group kept waxing strong in all fronts. The group  through the effort of Pastor DO Odubanjo was affiliated to the Faith Tabernacle of America.  The relationship was soon  severe  with the Faith tabernacle of the  America as a result of irreconcilable differences that broke up among the leaders of the church  in America .The group  sought for alliance with the British Apostolic Church in Bradford.  On 23rd September 1931, three missionaries  who were representatives  of the British church arrived  in Nigeria. In November 1931 first seven leaders of the group were ordained as the Pastor of the church. The church was formally incorporated and registered by the government as Christ Apostolic Church in the year 1943. It was the first indigenous church to be registered in Nigeria. 
The church believes in the power of prayer, holiness living, divine healing, all sufficient God who is able to provide without going into debt or borrowing.  The church also involve in regular bible study, prayer meetings , keeping prayer vigil and tarrying meeting for the Holy Spirit.. The church  CAC as at today is a popular Pentecostal church in Nigeria. It has since developed from a parlour state to be one of the widespread denominational churches in Nigeria. Beyond this, the 
 church has different department like Good women , Youth department, Royal Shepherd,  Christ Apostolic Church Men Association (CACMA).  Also the church has many educational institutions  which are run by the church. Theological seminary where Church workers are being trained,  Private University known as  Joseph Ayo Babalola University in Nigeria..

2061,OYA RELIGIOUS GROUP IN OYO,43,Religious Group (v6),"Oyo people are a distinct linguistic group among the Yoruba race. They had one of the strongest military among the Yoruba prior to colonial rule. They held strongly to their traditional religious views which, as they claimed, helped in their successful military campaigns. They are found in present day Oyo state, Nigeria. Their population is about 471,000. From oral history, the town was founded by Oranmiyan the last son of Oduduwa, the great ancestor of the Yoruba people. Generally, the religious and political history of the people can be traced to their migration from Ile-Ife. But more specifically, they have a ritual tradition which is spectacular. It is attached to Sango and Oya festivals. Oya was the wife of Sango during his life time. In cosmological understanding of Orisa belief, she was such an outstanding figure among the female deities. Her imposing pedigree therefore makes her group to be unique.  The group showcases her festival with Bata drum as it makes it distinct for ritual practices. This unique ritual practice of the Oya group is shared with the Sango group. Oral tradition has it that Oya was one of the deities sent to the earth by Olodumare for creation and earth-remodelling. She is reputed for her fearlessness and believed to live in or inhabit the wind. Oya is known for her reputable character as a warrior and as a mother that loves children. Oya is a goddess that professes love in her character. This is seen from the way she stood with her husband, Sango, in the time of crisis. She is a mother who protects her children from any form of danger because she accords wealth to them and does not support hypocritical acts and betrayal. Rather, she loves people who are truthful and those who possess a pure heart. A mythical narrative made it clear that Oya was so faithful to to Sango, her husband that she alone of all his wives accompanied him in his flight towards Nupeland in his time of crisis. Oya, according to the myth could not bear the pain of her husband's disappearance after his death that she committed suicide. This act was her way of sharing in her husband's destiny. she died in her hometown, Ira and was thus deified. The Oya group has a well developed religious cult on the River Niger in Nigeria to symbolize her heroic acts. The cult is still devoted to their practices till today. While Sango is recognized as the spirit of thunder and lightning, Oya is known to be the spirit of wind. Sango is acknowledged for fierce tornadoes and intense thunderstorm while Oya is reputed for her windstorms which uproot trees and destroy houses. Oya is seen as a deified heroine and never spoken of as dead. Her votaries still belief that she is still living. She is not dead as she is both a deity and an ancestor who protects and watches over her living children or followers. The Indigenous religious festival, Ìṣẹ̀ṣe is performed by her group. This has been incorporated into some new religious traditions among some African groups in the Diaspora.",1800,1900,1995,1460,olusegun oladosu,57,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,2023-12-15 14:28:33.366 +0100,2024-03-06 19:51:18.186 +0100,Personal Expertise,0.9726767655869256,0.0012136395117161925,8.253949075849992e-22,0.02513178930023479,0.0009778056011234442,7.425829514960595e-21

2128,Paulicians,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Paulicians were a heterodox Christian group which emerged on the eastern frontiers of Byzantine Anatolia and in Armenia in the seventh century, apparently founded by a certain Armenian, Constantine of Samosata, who took the name Silvanus after one of the apostles of Paul, and who, according to legend, converted the official sent to try and execute him for heresy, with this man becoming his successor under the name of Titus, who would himself be executed by burning under Justinian II Rhinometos. Following the immolation  of their second leader, and fearing further persecution, the sect fled in a mass exodus to a certain region on the Eastern frontier known as Episparis, and thence to another adjacent region called Mananalis following the trial and acquittal of their leader Gegnaesius for heresy under the auspices of Leo I for fear of further interventions and potential persecution on the part of the Roman state; nevertheless, the emperor Constantine V effected the forced migration of numerous Paulicians to Thrace to strengthen the Thracian frontier, which would be the first of many forced and imperially mandated migrations from Anatolia to the Balkans. The death of Gegnaesius occasioned a  schism in the church between the party of Baanes and that of Sergius, with the Sergites gaining the ascendancy apparently proselytizing widely in the eastern provinces, and inviting renewed persecutions under Leo the Armenian. Under Theodora, a still more intense persecution began, which eventually led to the flight of many Paulicians under their leader Karbeas across the border into the districts of Armenia under Islamic rule, where the Emir of Melitene allowed them to construct the fortress city of Tephrike, which acted as a redoubt and buffer state with Byzantium under Arab protection. Nevertheless, in the late 9th century, Basil I conquered these principalities after prolonged wars with a particularly bellicose leader known as Chrysocheir, and while part of the population retreated further into Armenia, merging, evidently, into the emerging Tondrakian movement, much of the rest was deported to the Thracian provinces by he and his immediate successors, where they continued to exist as a distinct ethnoreligious group, renowned as hill raiders and warriors, and concentrated especially in the vicinity of Philippopolis, where they evidently evangelized the local population to their creed. They are believed to be the ancestors of modern day Banat Bulgarians who converted to Catholicism in the 16th and 17th Centuries, as well as of the Muslim Pomaks. It is also possible they had some influence on the Bogomiil sect and on that of the Cathars, though this may be a mistaken connection. The basic doctrines of the sect are very much a subject of debate, whether they were dualistic, gnostic, adoptionist, or simply a reformist movement unrelated to these designations. Their Christology seems to have been nontrinitarian, and according to the (admittedly biased) accounts of their belief attributed to the pen of to Petros Sikeliotes, they accepted the New Testament though not the Tanakh, and evidently had iconoclastic tendencies and worshipped in simple meetinghouses, though the account may represent a spurious source. Anna Komnene refers to them as Manichaeans in her Alexiad, but this seems to be more an imputation of potential dualism or perhaps a generic term of disparagement rather than any indication that they actually followed the doctrines of Mani. Based on their apparent rejection of imperial ecclesiastical and secular hierarchies, they are sometimes considered an egalitarian or proto-Marxist movement, or, conversely, a proto-protestant one, though such arguments are spurious at best.",650,1700,1893,1320,Ethan Schmidt,49,Ian Randall,2024-01-21 23:00:15.816 +0100,2024-01-29 06:17:04.042 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.13885888409797334,0.19505402426254367,0.490589167684503,0.16961969263032395,0.005878231324655364,6.66144498175133e-16

2138,الجماعة الأحمدية الإسلامية في نيجيريا,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Ahmadiyya Movement was founded in British India by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1836-1906), an Islamic reformist and mystic, who in 1891 claimed that he was a prophet, mujaddid (“renewer”), and the messiah/mahdi anticipated by Muslims. The Movement was introduced in Lagos in 1916 and became popular among young intellectuals. Consequently it split in the 1930s over the issue of foreign control. A Nigerian branch of the Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam took shape under the leadership of Alhaji Jibril Martin, a leader of the Nigerian Youth Movement. By the 1950s there were three separate sections of the Ahmadiyya Movement in Lagos. Martin was also a cofounder and chairman of the Pilgrims’ Board of Nigeria’s western region, which administered the hajj pilgrimage following independence.
The Ahmadiyya Movement began establishing centers in the north in the 1960s, which was resisted among local Muslim leaders, including Abubakar Gumi, an Islamic legal scholar and future leader of the Islamist Yan Izala movement. Gumi translated several anti-Ahmadiyya works, including those by Pakistani Islamist Abul A'la al-Mawdudi, and supported the decision of the Islamic World League condemning the Ahmadiyya as heretical. In 1973, Saudi Arabia forbade Ahmadi Muslims from acquiring hajj visas, leading to violent protests in Nigeria during which Ahmadis occupied the Saudi embassy in Lagos. In 1974, the Nigerian Supreme Council of Islamic Affairs and the Jama’atu Nasril Islam adopted the League’s resolution, requiring that Muslims seeking a hajj visa acquire a written certificate from a local imam affirming that he or she was not a member of the Ahmadiyya Movement. As a result, the Ahmadiyya Movement split again, one dissenting group adopting the named Anwar al-Islam (“Rays of Islam”) and aligning itself with mainstream Sunni Islam. 

Nayyar's stay in Lagos coincided with the establishment of additional branches in Ebutte-Meta and Epe. Movement activities commenced in Yaba in 1921, and within two years, members had established missions in Ibadan, Kano and Zaria.[6] Expansion into Ado-Odo, Otta, Ijede and Ondo was completed by the mid 1930s .",1916,2024,1082,1304,Jabir  Musa,55,Julian Weideman,2024-01-25 11:41:38.267 +0100,2024-01-25 11:41:38.267 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.10289570404474999,0.0027358469064437934,0.7991461272260284,0.09521348226147294,8.839561304797324e-06,2.7515748570704356e-34

2149,Judaism in Byzantium,43,Religious Group (v6),"Jews constituted a significant minority group with the Byzantine Empire for the entirety of its history, and were, to a degree, integrated into wider Roman society, yet occupying something of a liminal position. Their legal status was defined and circumscribed in Late Antiquity by successive legislations, with them being guaranteed a degree of protection from arbitrary molestation and right to practice their religion freely, while also being legally and socially subordinated to the Christian majority. For example, the Theodosian code barred their participation in civil or military officialdom, while the Justinianic code attempted to subordinate the administration of the Jewish community to that of the Roman State, further circumscribing the rights of Jews and, most strikingly, banning the public reading of the Pentateuch in Hebrew rather than Greek, and totally proscribing the reading of the Mishna. Herakleios, faced with a combination of internal crisis and Jewish support of Sassanian and later Arab occupations of Syria and Egypt, attempted a massive forced conversion of Jews and heretics within the empire, though this was apparently unsuccessful, as the continued existence of vigorous Jewish communities within Byzantium attest, and the years between the reign of Herakleios and the Fourth Crusade would be punctuated by only brief and limited persecutions under Leo III the Isaurian, Basil I the Macedonian, and Ioannes Tzimiskes. Despite their potentially precarious social and legal position, the Jewish communities of Byzantium flourished; Justinian's prohibition on the reading of the Mishna conversely led to the composition of elaborate liturgical poems known as piyutim, which were influential in later traditions of the Mahzor, while scholars in a Jewish Community in the Byzantine Catepanate of Italy composed the famous chronicle of the Sefer Yosippon. Benjamin of Tudela's notes on his travels through Byzantium in the twelfth century during the reign of Manuel I Komnenos reveal a world in which, despite both institutionalized and informal systems of antisemitic segregation and discrimination, Jewish communities flourished economically, taking part in agriculture, medicine, trade, and the especially the production of luxury textiles. Though partially segregated from broader society by the boundaries of their designated quarters and internal communal institutions, Jewish communities were a conspicuous presence in the larger cities of the Byzantine world such as Thebes, Corinth, Thessalonike, Rhodes, and above all in Pera-Galata opposite Constantinople, which, before it became a Genoese colony, was an extramural settlement of Jews and tanners. The depredations visited upon the Empire by Latin Crusaders and seaborne marauders that would culminate in the Fourth Crusade effected Byzantine Jews as it did their Christian neighbors (or, indeed, perhaps more so), and the impoverished successor states which emerged from those crises proved more able and more willing to persecute Jews than their predecessors, as bouts of persecution in the Despotate of Epiros under Theodore Komnenos Doukas, and in the Empire of Nikaia under Ioannes Vatatzes and his son Theodoros II Laskaris demonstrate. Nevertheless, the ascension of the Palaiologoi at least temporarily reversed this pattern, for Michael VIII relied on the funds of the Jewish community in his bid for emperor and, as such, extended to them certain freedoms and protections which were preserved by his son and successor Andronikos II, attracting censure from the Melkite Patriarch of Alexandria. Ultimately, the Jewish communities which proved the sites of the most anxiety for the Palaiologoi would be those of Venetian Jews or Jews of naturalized Venetian citizenship, who thus came under the purview of the economic and legal concessions granted to La Serenissima. The conquest of Byzantium by the Ottomans, however, incorporated Byzantine, or Romaniote, Jews into a far broader patchwork of communities in Europe and the Middle East, and led to the settlement in the Aegean of numerous Sephardic refugees fleeing from the kingdoms of Iberia, which would alter the Jewish demography of the region. Nevertheless, Romaniote congregations continue to exist in Greece, Israel, and the United States to this day.",330,1453,1893,1320,Ethan Schmidt,49,Ian Randall,2024-01-29 16:09:16.212 +0100,2024-02-22 19:00:42.575 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.8585462294067232,0.021477715929635075,5.955713789331865e-11,0.11171173926818194,0.008264315335902678,5.967389221045941e-20
2157,Blue Light Evangelicals in the Late Eighteenth-Century Royal Navy,43,Religious Group (v6),"Rear Admiral Richard Kempenfelt and Comptroller of the Navy Charles Middleton are credited for spearheading the Blue Light Movement within the Royal Navy. This was a Methodist campaign that sought to restore ritualized religious adherence among sailors aboard ship throughout the American, French, and Napoleonic Wars. This aquatic sub-revival is closely affiliated with the Navy, but merchantmen also witnessed this movement below deck. Navy officers with Methodist leanings were principally referred to as ""Blue Lights,"" and while these men were characteristically socially and politically conservative, they believed that the spiritual status-quo of the Royal Navy prior to the American Revolutionary War necessitated reform. The Blue Lights believed that the Navy was tainted by licentiousness, lethargy and moral decline due to a lack of competent religious leadership throughout the eighteenth-century and needed a spiritual reawakening. For these staunch Protestants, a primary aim for introducing evangelical Christianity into British maritime life was to group officers and common seamen together in a religious unity that transcended rank. Blue Lights perceived the ship as a fertile missional ground for evangelistic activity and paternal pastorship among the rank and file. As one ""church,"" officers and sailors gathered below deck in the crew's quarters to read the Bible, sing psalms, and pray in equitable brotherhood; a revolutionary idea in a traditional environment that structurally reinforced rank segregation. As a term, it is difficult to ascertain when ""Blue Light"" was first used. However, the nickname caught on by the end of the Napoleonic Wars in naval circles, with common sailors being referred to as Methodists or pslam-singers and officers as Blue Lights (sometimes also called psalm-singers).",1775,1815,2225,1560,Bethany Henderson,1,M.

2178,Aladura Christianity in Nigeria,43,Religious Group (v6),"Aladura Christianity emerged in Nigeria in the early 20th century as a response to the perceived inadequacies of the Mainline Christian denominations in addressing the spiritual and physical needs of the people. The movement sought a return to what its founders believed were the authentic, spiritual roots of Christianity. Also, the emergence of this brand of Christianity could be said to be in reaction to a community in turmoil caused by hunger, the Great Depression, smallpox, and influenza outbreaks, which were some of the effects of the First World War. The term ""Aladura"" is a Yoruba word that translates to ""owners of prayer"" or ""people of prayer."" Aladura Christianity has played a significant role in the religious landscape of Nigeria. Key figures in the early history of the Aladura movement in Nigeria include Joseph Babalola of the Christ Apostolic Church (CAC), Moses Orimolade Tunolase and Christiana Abiodun Emanuel, prominent leaders associated with the Cherubim and Seraphim (C&S), Josiah Ositelu of the Church of the Lord - Aladura (CLA) and Samuel Bilewu Joseph Oschoffa of the Celestial Church of Christ (CCC).
Since its founding as prayer gatherings inside more established Nigerian churches, particularly the Church Missionary Society (CMS), the Aladura churches have attracted a sizable following. Early in the 20th century, the Aladura churches flourished, although along ethnic lines, especially among the Yoruba. Over the years, this brand of Christianity has enjoyed significant patronage from other tribes. Salvation, repentance, forgiveness, holiness, healing, deliverance, exorcism, spiritual baptism, spiritual gifts, and spiritual authority are the foundational elements of Aladura Christianity.
Aladura churches emphasise the importance of fervent prayer and spiritual warfare against forces of evil, and to retain the presence and power of the Holy Spirit. Members often engage in intense prayer sessions, deliverance services, and fasting. This movement places strong emphasis on divine healing and miracles through the power of the Holy Spirit. Healing services and the belief in the laying on of hands for healing are common practices. Their services are known for their vibrant and charismatic worship style, including lively music, dancing, and spontaneous expressions of faith. The movement embraces the charismatic and Pentecostal aspects of Christianity. Many Aladura churches have a strong prophetic ministry, where leaders and members believe in receiving and delivering messages from God through prophetic utterances. They often incorporate elements of indigenous African spirituality and cultural practices. The group's syncretic practices are evident in the use of indigenous languages, cultural symbols, and rituals.
Aladura churches are often involved in community development, social welfare, and philanthropic activities. They play a role in addressing social issues such as poverty, education, and healthcare in their communities. It must be noted that while Aladura Christianity has its roots in Nigeria, it has spread to other parts of the world. Churches affiliated with the Aladura movement can be found in various countries with Nigerian and African communities. This brand of Christianity has contributed significantly to the diversity of Christian expression in Nigeria and has influenced the broader Pentecostal and Charismatic movements within the country.",1918,2023,1082,1451,Oluwasegun Aluko,57,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,2024-02-12 10:46:30.872 +0100,2024-04-29 17:15:48.862 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.10289570404474999,0.0027358469064437934,0.7991461272260284,0.09521348226147294,8.839561304797324e-06,2.7515748570704356e-34
2180,Cao Đài,43,Religious Group (v6),"Cao Đài is a syncretic indigenous Vietnamese religion that was born out of the milieu of the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam and the borderlands of Vietnam and Cambodia. Although the religion is monotheistic, it also intentionally blends elements of Catholicism, Vietnamese folk traditions, Chinese religions (especially the sanjiao or tâm giáo, Daoism, Confucianism, and Chinese influenced/Chinese Buddhism), and more global understandings of revelation. For instance, the Prophet Muhammed is considered part of the ""Prophets of the Christian Era"" along with the Prophet Baab (Bahai'i), Moses (Judaism), and Jesus (Christianity). The religion was founded by Ngô Văn Chiêu, who was a Vietnamese administrator and district head in the French colony of Cochinchina. Officially, this new religion became name as the Đại Đạo Tam Kỳ Phổ Độ (Great way of the Third Time of Redemption,"" indicating the perception that the early 20th century was to be a new era of revealed truth.

During the First Indochina War, the Cao Đài movement formed their own militia, which was then subordinated to the Republic of Vietnam military (ARVN) during the Second Indochina War. Typically anti-communist during the Second Indochina War, Cao Đài militia members were treated with extra scrutiny during and after the subsequent reunification of Vietnam in 1976. Consequentially, substantial Cao Đài diasporas can be found in France, the United States, Canada and Australia. However, after normalization of relations between Vietnam and the United States in 1995, during a period of liberalization in the late 1990s, Cao Đài recognition in Vietnam was officially granted in 1997. Thus, after 1997, Cao Đài practice has been relatively unrestricted and formally recognized. In recent decades, splinter schools or offshoots of the officially recognized Cao Đài religion have complained about scolding and harassment from state sanctioned Cao Đài authorities. Such debates have emerged in a context where state-sanctioned religious sites, especially the main Cao Đài temple in Tây Ninh province--just north of Hồ Chí Minh City, have become major sites for the international tourist community to visit. Finally, in the past two decades, the role of remissions from the diaspora community to Cao Đài organizations in Vietnam has become increasingly significant.",1921,2024,2244,520,William Noseworthy,37,William Noseworthy,2024-02-12 20:33:46.646 +0100,2024-04-09 16:38:00.732 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.8420484054317028,0.00027336823021337973,2.7157803763064115e-32,2.5755516712413747e-10,0.15767822608052873,1.2574085480179307e-29
2194,The Redeemed Christian Church of God,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) was founded in Nigeria in 1952 by Josiah Olufemi Akindayomi.  The church has a rich history and a profound impact on the global Christian landscape. 
Akindayomi was born in Ondo, Southwestern Nigeria, in 1909.  Although he was born into a family that followed indigenous religions, he later joined the Anglican Church, where he was baptized in 1927.  His religious desire made him move further to the Cherubim and Seraphim Church (C & S) in 1931.  He founded a prayer group within the C&S, which he called Egbe Ogo Oluwa (The Glory of God Fellowship) in 1947.  It was this group that metamorphosed into the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) in 1952.  According to Ogunewu, Akindayomi made several prophetic declarations about the RCCG that have come to fruition. He predicted that the church would spread to all nations of the world and that it would be characterized by mighty miracles and wonders. Akindayomi also foresaw that the RCCG would be at the forefront of a Pentecostal explosion on the African continent. His commitment to prayer, evangelism, and spiritual growth laid the foundation for the church’s remarkable growth and influence. By the time of his death in 1980, RCCG had about 40 parishes within Nigeria.
Enoch Adejare Adeboye succeeded Akindayomi as the General Overseer in 1981.  Before this appointment, he served as the founder’s interpreter, demonstrating his close relationship with the church’s origins.  Born on March 2, 1942, in Ifewara, Osun State, Nigeria, Adeboye hails from a very humble family. He often shares the story of wearing his first shoes at the age of 18.  Adeboye went to Ilesha Grammar School in Osun State and started to study mathematics at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka.  Due to the Nigerian Civil War, he completed his first degree in mathematics at the University of Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University) in 1967.  His academic pursuits continued with a Master’s degree in hydrodynamics from the University of Lagos and a Ph.D. in applied mathematics from the same institution.  Adeboye joined the RCCG in 1973 and initially served as an interpreter. In 1975, he was ordained as a pastor by Pa. Josiah Akindayomi.  By 1981, he had become the General Overseer, leading the church’s expansion.  The RCCG, which had 40 parishes in Nigeria at the time of his appointment, has now grown to about 198 nations worldwide, with over 9 million worshipers in Nigeria alone.  He is considered a preacher of the holiness movement and emphasizes Christian discipleship through local churches. Adeboye’s global impact extends beyond Africa, with a great following for the church through various Christian ministries and social efforts  Adeboye’s vision includes establishing RCCG branches within walking or driving distance in cities, ensuring accessibility for worshipers.
The church emphasizes holiness, discipleship, and obedience to God’s Word. RCCG’s impact extends beyond Africa, touching lives through ministries and social efforts. In 1990, the RCCG Bible School was founded, nurturing leaders and ministers. The Redemption Camp in Mowe, Lagos, was purchased in 1983, serving as a hub for conferences, retreats, and worship. The Redeemed Christian Fellowship (RCF) for students was established in 1988, fostering spiritual growth among young believers.  The church’s headquarters, now at 1-5 Redemption Way, Ebute-Metta, Lagos, symbolizes its journey from humble beginnings to global prominence.",1952,2023,2256,1525,Olusegun Olawoyin,57,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,2024-02-17 04:12:52.372 +0100,2024-03-04 18:55:05.728 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),1.1987998141380545e-23,1.9267481564791e-25,6.672987969358441e-23,0.9999967900661204,3.2099338795959857e-06,1.910193916952835e-34
2209,The Church of Nigeria Anglican Communion,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Anglican Church in Nigeria is a Christian English Church with the root in Church of England. She has members spread across every geopolitical zone in Nigeria. Although the church population is said to be about 18.74million members according to Journal of Anglican Studies published by Cambridge University Press her active membership is put at just over 11 million adherents. The Anglican Church in Nigeria has a rich history that dates back to the 19th century. The Anglican Church's presence in Nigeria can be traced back to the arrival of British missionaries in the mid-19th century. The Church Missionary Society (CMS) played a significant role in the establishment and growth of the Anglican Church in Nigeria during this time. The history of the Church began from 1842 when the Church Missionary Society (CMS) ably led by Henry Townsend landed in Badagry, Western part of Nigeria.
Missionaries such as Samuel Ajayi Crowther, who later became the first African Anglican bishop in Nigeria, were instrumental in spreading the Anglican faith across the country. The Anglican Church in Nigeria grew steadily throughout the colonial period, and its influence expanded as it established schools, hospitals, and other social institutions. The church also played a significant role in the spread of Western education in Nigeria. Following Nigeria's independence in 1960, the Anglican Church continued to grow and evolve, becoming an integral part of the country's religious and social fabric. The church has been involved in various social and political issues and has contributed to the development of Nigeria in numerous ways.
Today, the Anglican Church in Nigeria is one of the largest Christian denominations in the country, with millions of members. It has its own hierarchy of Primate, Archbishops, Bishops, clergy, and dioceses, and it remains an influential force in Nigerian society. The Anglican Church in Nigeria continues to be active in various areas, including education, healthcare, and social welfare, and it plays a vital role in the spiritual and moral life of the Nigerian people. Its involvement in higher education propelled the establishment of Universities in Nigeria. Prominent among these Universities are Ajayi Crowther University, Oyo in western part of Nigeria and St Paul’s University, Awka in the Eastern part of the country.
Currently the Anglican Church in Nigeria comprises of one hundred and sixty-one dioceses (161) with Bishops overseeing them. These dioceses are arranged into 14 Ecclesiastical Provinces under the administration of Archbishops and being supervised by the Primate of Church of Nigeria, Anglican Communion; The Most Revd Henry Chukwudum Ndukuba. The past Archbishops and Primate of Church of Nigeria include The Most Revd T.O. Olufosoye, The Most Revd J.A. Adetiloye, The Most Revd P.J. Akinola and The Most Revd Nicholas Okoh. 
Apart from its effort in promoting health, welfare and Western education in Nigeria, the Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion), operates standard training Institutions for the theological education and spiritual and pastoral formation of its priests. Currently, the church has eight (8) Theological colleges spread across the country.

2210,Living Faith Church Worldwide,43,Religious Group (v6),"The founding of the Living Faith Church  International is directly linked with the divine call of the founder in person of Bishop David O. Oyedepo.  So, it is good to begin with the life story of David Oyedepo and how he was called into the ministry. David Olaniyi Oyedepo was born in Osogbo, in the present Osun State, Nigeria  on September 27th, 1954. He is however, a native of Omu-Aran, Irepodun Local Government Area of Kwara State, Nigeria. He was raised in a mixed-religious family. His father, Ibrahim, was a Muslim healer.. His mother, Dorcas, was a member of the Holy Order of the Cherubim and Seraphim Movement Church (C&S), a branch of the Aladura movement in Nigeria. He was raised by his grandmother in Osogbo, who introduced him to the virtues of Christian life via early morning prayers. She also taught him the importance of tithing. After his primary and secondary education, Oyedepo proceeded to study architecture at the Kwara State Polytechnic Ilorin.. He worked briefly with the Federal Ministry of Housing in Ilorin before resigning to concentrate on missionary work. He was born again in 1969, through the influence of his teacher, Betty Lasher, who took an interest in him during his high school days. According to him, he received a mandate from God through an 18-hour vision in May 1981, to liberate the world from all oppression of the devil through the preaching of the word of faith. This inaugural vision led to the founding of the Living Faith Church World Wide (LFCWW), first called Liberation Faith Hour Ministries, in 1981. Two years later, on September 17, 1983, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, ordained David and his wife, Florence Abiola Akano (known as Faith Abiola Oyedepo) to become pastors and officially commissioned the new church. Five years later, he was ordained as Bishop by Archbishop Benson Idahosa. 
Living Faith Church (AKA Winners Chapel International) started in Kaduna but moved to Lagos, the former capital of Nigeria in July 1989, to start a new branch of the church after Bishop Oyedepo received instructions from God to reach out to the people of Lagos.  Since 21st August, 1982, Bishop David Oyedepo has been happily married to his heartthrob, Pastor Mrs. Florence Abiola Akano (now known as Faith). They have four children together (David Jr, Isaac, Love and Joyce). David Oyedepo (Jr) and Isaac Oyedepo were ordained as Pastors in May 2007 by Kenneth Copeland. David Oyedepo Jr formerly pastored the London Branch of the Church with his wife, Kemi but is now the resident pastor of the Ministry's headquarters church (Faith Tabernacle) while Isaac Oyedepo pastors Winners' Chapel International, Maryland, in the United States of America with his wife Ayomitide.

Bishop Oyedepo began his Church ministry and planted the 1st Church in Kaduna, called, Living Faith World Outreach – Dec. 11, 1983. He published and released his first 2 books; ‘The Miracle seed, and The Law of Faith,’ in April 25, 1985. He founded the Word of Faith Bible Institute, which today runs across many nations of the world – Sep. 1: 1986. He began church planting work in the northern part of Nigeria – May 1987. His mission acquired a 13-acre property in a prime area of Kaduna city called Garden of Faith – Sep. 1989.  He moved into Lagos, following a divine mandate, “Arise get down to Lagos and raise me a people” – Sep. 24, 1989. He founded Dominion Publishing House, whose printing press has today grown to an industrial scale and currently publishing Bibles – July 1992. He led a great revival at the Lagos church that took the church from about 3,500 to 50,000 within 5 years – 1994-1999.

Also, by divine instruction, he led the replication of over 21,000 new home cells within one year at Faith Tabernacle, which represents about a hundred percent of the existing home cells in 2021. He further led the planting of Churches in 80 additional nations across 4 continents of the world in 2022. Currently, the construction of the historic 100,000-seat capacity stadium-like sanctuary, whose foundation was laid on March 25, 2021, is very much in progress, with the claim that God’s hand was clearly evident in the areas of speed, supplies, etc..

The Ministry's biggest annual meeting Shiloh, holds every December in the Faith Tabernacle. It hosts thousands of congregants across the world.

Winners Chapel International operates a Bible training programme known as the Word of Faith Bible Institute for members and non-members alike to develop knowledge of Christian principles as well as to develop leaders and future pastors. The institute is run in major branches of the Church. Oyedepo is the president and chairman of David Oyedepo Ministries International (DOMI), the umbrella organisation comprising Living Faith Church World Wide (a global network of churches), World Mission Agency (WMA); the global missionary arm of the church's operations, Dominion Publishing House (DPH - the publishing arm of the church), Covenant University, and the Social Development Missions projects - made up of hospitals, maternity homes, schools, etc. Oyedepo has criticized corruption in Africa as a whole and poor leadership in government.

2220,Ansar-ud-deen Society of Nigeria,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Ansar-ud-deen Society of Nigeria is a Muslim organisation established in Lagos, Nigeria with a view to developing the Muslim community in terms of education, and enhancing the social and moral development of the Muslims. The organisation was founded in 1923. It is neither a sectarian nor a political educational organisation. In fact, in the typological analysis of Islamic organisations in Nigerian society, Ansar-ud-deen society of Nigeria is considered as one of the first generation Islamic organizations in the country.
The establishment of the organisation in question was informed by a response to the advent of a class of Western trained Christian elites in the colonial capital of Lagos. Thus, this organization emerged to engage in the promotion of reformist ideas and development in the Muslim communities of Lagos and later in Nigeria. Today, the society has gone far to the extent that its branches abound in almost every place where Nigerian Muslims are found at home and abroad. In 1926, the society constituted a mission board assigned to organize the religious related activities such as the celebration of some important Islamic events and dates, open-air praying, child naming ceremonies and fund raising programs. 
The organization has spread all over the towns and cities in Nigeria. And characteristically, any place where the branch is found, there used to be the society’s mosque where members would be observing their prayers, particularly the Jumʻah Salah (Friday’s prayer) that divinely holds on every Friday in lieu of the Zuhr Salah (afternoon’s prayer) that is being observed in any other day. During the service on Fridays, the chief Imam of the branch will lead the congregants by first delivering khutbah (sermon) before the observance of two rakʻahs. The recital from the Quranic passages in the prayer, including the opening chapter of the Quran, will be made aloud- and this is opposed to the manner of recitation during the middle of the day in all other six days of the week.
In the Ansar-ud-deen Society, women are active major players. They are being carried along with all the organizational activities. The society has a women’s wing, whereby the majority of the wives of the members too play a vital role in the religious propagation and obligations among their fellow women in the society. As a matter of fact, the women’s role is spiritual and material. They engage in a prayer session called Asalãtu on Sundays, and make a financial contribution which is of material benefit to the development of the society. Both the men and the women fundraise for the society’s coffer. The funds generated through the members’ contribution is being used to run the affairs of the society which include, among other things, building of mosques and madãris (Arabic/ Islamic schools), sponsorship of many dawah programs through the mass media and so on.",1923,2023,1082,1569,Abdul mumin Alawiye,55,Julian Weideman,2024-02-26 13:33:50.837 +0100,2024-05-05 14:16:32.994 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),1.6485003489436424e-58,3.585207150173675e-46,1.4555326651847594e-136,3.1574899323268194e-110,1.4335283498744348e-18,1.0
2228,Church of God Mission,43,Religious Group (v6),"This entry is about the Church of God Mission, a Christian denomination (Pentecostal/Charismatic). The Church of God Mission was founded in Nigeria by Benson Idahosa in the year 1972. The root of the Church of God Mission can be traced back to a prayer group that was named Calvary Fellowship which was inaugurated by Edgar Perkings (a clergy) officially in 1965 (though they began meeting in 1962). They started by meeting in a shop on Ivbizua Street, off Mission Road. Benson Idahosa was at that time the Sunday School Superintendent of Assemblies of God Church but on October 26, 1968,  Perkins requested that the leadership of the Assemblies of God church release Idahosa to oversee the prayer ministry. After Idahosa took over leadership, the group moved to Number 26, Forestry Road, Benin City. The group began to experience numerical growth leading to the erection of church buildings. They moved into the Iyaro Church building in 1974 which resulted in more numerical growth. Syney Elton and Gordon Lindsay who were both foreign missionaries were the ones who declared the church open. Benson Idahosa was one of the most outstanding gospel preachers of his time in Africa. He is referred to as a leading Independent “mega-church” preacher in Africa. He was trained at the Christ for the Nations Institute, Dallas, Texas (an independent Pentecostal college) for three months in 1971. 

The church Motto is: Evangelism our Supreme Task. Idahosa believed he is sent by God to raise up an army that will go with the gospel to all Nations to teach, preach and heal in the power of the Holy Spirit as exemplified by the life of Idahosa. This led to the church soul conversion efforts, church planting and erection of modern church buildings. The numerical growth of the church led the building of Miracle Centre and dedication in 1975 with seating capacity of over 10,000. He got good financial support for these buildings from American partners such as Gordon and Freda Lindsay, T.L. Osborn and Jim Bakker. Faith Miracle Centre auditorium reputed to seat over 20,000 people was completed in 1986. Several other church building was erected later and the church grew to have branches all over the world. By 1991 Church of God Mission had at least 300,000 members and a ministry headquarters in Benin City, in the southern part of Nigeria. Benson Idahosa and the Church of God Mission had good relationships with other charismatic organizations in Africa and beyond. The mentees of Benson Idahosa (who later became Archbishop) are many, they include; David Oyedepo of the Living Faith Church and the Founder of Covenant University, Christ Oyakilome of the Believers Love World Church, Ayo Oritsejafor of the Word of Life Bible Church, Johnson Suleiman of Omega Fire Ministries, Mike Okonkwo of The Redeemed Evangelical Mission (TREM), Wale Oke, Fred Ado and the Ghanian pastor, Dunkan Williams,

Benson Idahosa was seen as controversial when he promoted the financial and material prosperity of the church by his preaching the wealth and health gospel. Idahosa posits that Christians are supposed to enjoy material things such as televisions, automobiles, have money, possess the good things of life and that the church should not be poor. The church in Nigeria today as a result is one of the wealthiest in the world with more than 30 universities, many primaries and secondary schools, hospitals and other diversified investments. It became controversial because some opined that he emphasized prosperity at the expense of gamine biblical virtues such as faithfulness, integrity and holy living. He had confrontations with witches and wizards during his life time. In a live press conference Benson Idahosa opposed and stopped the proposed world conference of at least 9,800witches and wizard scheduled to hold in Benin City, Nigeria when he threatened that death will be the result for the conveners.The Church of God Mission began The All Nations for Christ Bible Institute to gospel ministers. This institute grew to become the leading bible institute in Africa during Idahosa’s lifetime. The Word of Faith Group of Schools was started to carter for the educational needs of those in pre-nursery, primary and secondary schools. The Benson Idahosa University was started to carter for the tertiary educational needs of the people.  The Faith Mediplex Group of Hospitals was initiated to attend to the medical needs of the people. In 1998 the sudden death of the Founder of the Church of God Mission was announced and his wife and ministry partner assumed leadership of the ministry. It has been reported that Idahosa’s demise had negative impact on the continued growth and unity of the Church of God Mission.

2232,"Lollards, Lollard, the Lollard movement, Lollardism,  Lollardy, Wycliffites",43,Religious Group (v6),"The Lollards were a proto-Protestant, dissident, heretical sect that emerged towards the end of the fourteenth century in England, the ideas of which continued as a strand of religious thought until the English Reformation of the sixteenth century. Lollardy and its adherents were thought to be associated with the Oxford scholar John Wycliffe and his circle of followers, and to follow their ideas and teachings. Although the two groups share ideas, “Wycliffite” more accurately describes the cadre of academic theologians and associated individuals who followed the teaching of Wycliffe, while the term “Lollard” is more general and denotes anyone or anything deemed heretical, those who criticised the practices of the Church, and those who called for reform. Although the etymology is uncertain, “Lollard” is said to derive from the Middle Dutch verb lollen “to sing” (a derogatory reference to muttering or mumbling) or, more likely, from Latin lolium “tare”, a sort of damaging weed and a reference to the Parable of the Weeds. Within both the Wycliffites and the Lollards, emphasis was placed on personal faith, vernacular scripture, divine election, and biblical authority. Aspects of Church teaching and practice that they criticised include transubstantiation, clerical celibacy, ecclesiastical hierarchy, indulgences, pilgrimage, iconography, the cult of the saints, fasting and abstinence, and other aspects of Catholic practice. In some respects, the Lollards resemble earlier groups focused on reform, such as the Fraticelli, and exerted significant influence on later continental movements such as the Hussites in Bohemia, which began with the reformer, Jan Hus.

In addition, Xiantiandao is a significant influence on the Vietnamese new religious movement Cao Dai (Đạo Cao Đài) that emerged from Sino-Vietnamese sectarian groups in 1920s French-colonial Saigon. 
While claiming descent from a genealogy of enlightened masters that goes back to the dawn of Chinese civilization, Xiantiandao emerged as a distinct religious group in eighteenth-century Jiangxi Province in southeastern China. In this early period, practitioners and outsiders seem to have referred to the sect and its teachings by various names, including Xiantiandao and Qinglianjiao 青蓮教 (""Green Lotus Sect""), a term that appears in nineteenth-century government surveillance material. Having appealed to traveling merchants and labor migrants in the nineteenth century, Xiantiandao quickly spread throughout southern and southwestern China and, from the 1860s onward, also to Chinese communities in Southeast Asia, especially in Thailand and what is now Singapore and Malaysia. 
Like many other nonofficial sects, Xiantiandao was subject to state persecution and vilification as an “evil sect” (xiejiao 邪教)—a deprecatory label employed by government officials and cultural elites to criminalize nonofficial religious groups that is still used today in public and political discourses in the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Accordingly, Xiantiandao was banned and persecuted by consecutive Chinese regimes, including the PRC. Thus, although almost entirely eradicated on the Chinese mainland since the early 1950s when it was considered a “counterrevolutionary sect” (fandong huidaomen 反動會道門), the sect still retained a considerable presence among overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. In fact, state persecution has fueled Xiantiandao’s translocal spread in many ways. For instance, many practitioners were forced underground following a large-scale crackdown in southwestern China in the 1840s. With many leaders apprehended and executed and forced to act clandestinely, Xiantiandao branched into various subsects and local networks, many of which later evolved into independent sectarian groups. The well-known redemptive societies Tongshanshe and Yiguandao, but also others such as Guigendao 歸根道 (“The Way of Returning to the Origin”) split off from Xiantiandao during this period of instability in the second half of the nineteenth century. 
Similar to many other Chinese sects, Xiantiandao’s teachings are often described as “syncretic.” This characterization highlights its peculiar synthesis of established symbols and beliefs—most notably the so-called “Three Teachings” (sanjiao 三教) of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism—and millenarian beliefs centering on the supramundane creator deity Wusheng Laomu 無生老母 (“Eternal Venerable Mother”) and her salvationist mission to rescue humankind from the impending apocalypse. Stressing individual moral self-cultivation as a means to restore one’s inherent original nature (a Buddhist concept), Xiantiandao practitioners seek to repatriate to Laomu’s “original homeland” (guxiang 故鄉) from which the early humans were exiled many eons ago. The sect’s teachings are immersed in a narrative of decline and moral corruption, according to which humankind is doomed to be annihilated in the final cosmic apocalypse, and only by following Laomu’s teachings will humans be able to restore their inherent true selves and return to her eternal paradise. Like in many earlier popular sects during the Qing period and many later ones, including Yiguandao and Tongshanshe, this narrative is embedded in a cycle of three consecutive cosmic periods. Even though the final period, which is called baiyang 白陽 (“White Sun”), represents the beginning of the world’s end, it also marks the period during which the universal truth is being made available to all of humankind, whereas in earlier cosmic periods, only selected people had access to it. Accordingly, the baiyang period represents a time of high urgency to spread the teachings and help more people avoid the apocalypse. 
Besides highlighting how Confucian-oriented social values are instrumental in actualizing one’s true self, vegetarianism is crucial in Xiantiandao teachings. Drawing on Buddhist, Daoist, and Confucian notions of meat abstention and fasting, it serves many purposes, from ritual purification to ethical concerns and cleaning up karmic bonds of one’s past existences. In addition, many Xiantiandao rituals, individual and communal, are conceptualized in Daoist-inspired terms, most notably neidan 內丹 (“internal alchemy”). Adopting the trope of laboratory alchemy to conceptualize meditative practices, neidan practitioners typically seek to invert the natural course of life by refining subtle substances within the human body to nurture an immortal embryo that will withstand the decay and death of the physical body. Finally, as far as we know, Xiantiandao is the earliest Chinese sectarian group to have adopted spirit-writing (fuluan 扶鸞, “yielding the phoenix,” or fuji 扶乩, “yielding the planchette”) as a means of communicating with deities, Buddhas, bodhisattvas, and deceased leaders. While it was already a widespread practice in many different religious contexts, it was only in the 1820s to 1840s that spirit-writing gained currency in Xiantiandao. It became an essential means of religious text production and a source of legitimacy, especially regarding leadership and organization.
In contrast to Buddhist and Daoist clerics, Xiantiandao sectarians consider themselves lay practitioners, meaning that most live ordinary lives and maintain families. The sect is organized according to a hierarchy of eight ranks, but the exact number may vary depending on which subsect, region, and period one looks at. This system channels access to the sect’s teachings and practices, whereby higher-level (“esoteric”) teachings are only available to accomplished practitioners. The rank-holders at the top of the hierarchy are also responsible for the overall organization and translocal proselytization. In many subsects, the highest four ranks are only available to men. Yet, researchers found that many practitioners and even entire communities are female, especially in Southeast Asia. Thus, during most of the twentieth century, Xiantiandao “vegetarian halls” (zhaitang 齋堂) in Thailand, Singapore, and Malaysia served as safe havens for unmarried women who sought to evade male-dominated lives and for widows. In traditional Chinese societies, Confucian values of obedience and female subordination strongly compelled girls and women to marry and give birth to children. Accordingly, seeking refuge in a Xiantiandao temple and living a chaste religious life was a rare opportunity to evade male domination.
Because of the PRC’s strict religious policy and anti-sectarian agenda, Xiantiandao has almost disappeared from the Chinese mainland. Even though some communities survived in Taiwan and Southeast Asia and continued to thrive well into the twentieth century, ideological pressure from mainstream Buddhist groups led to a large-scale “Buddhisization” of Xiantiandao communities. Accordingly, many sites were converted into Buddhist monasteries and temples, and many sectarian practitioners formally became Buddhist monastics.",1734,2024,2291,1595,Nikolas Broy,45,Matthew Hamm,2024-03-05 16:15:38.348 +0100,2024-03-05 16:15:38.348 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.8219189871769369,0.0008730037754636452,3.318915443161474e-11,0.1539873039290395,0.023220705085370854,8.781966018520082e-30

2264,Puritans,43,Religious Group (v6),"Puritanism was a Protestant reform movement that sought to ""purify"" the Church of England of lingering Roman Catholic ""popery."" As a term, ""puritan"" first emerged in England in the 1560s as an insult against ministers and laypeople who deviated from the orthodoxy of England's church. Puritans believed they were God's ""elect"" according to the Calvinist principle of predestination. They emphasized that a covenantal relationship with God was essential for the erasure of sins. This relationship came on the heels of an initial conversion experience that was emotionally, spiritually, and personally impactful. Salvation was thereafter administered to the saints by their preaching and testifying in partnership with the Holy Spirit: salvation's active instrument. Not to be confused with the Pilgrims of the Plymouth Colony who were theologically separatist from the established church and had ties to Holland, Puritans originally sought reform within the Church of England as non-separatists. Espousing ideas from Calvinism, Puritans perceived themselves as the predestined elect who were tasked to usher in the material Kingdom of God on earth. They promoted strict moral behaviour, presbyterian eldership of churches, and literacy for the sake of widespread Biblical teaching, preaching, and proselytization. Puritans perceived themselves in a similar light to the Jews as God's chosen but persecuted elect. Those who migrated to North America were among the more radical Puritan thinkers who were dissatisfied with the episcopal polity of the state church. Shunned for their congregational ideologies in England and outspoken criticisms, these ""separatist"" Puritans, dissatisfied with the church's stagnation and corruption, migrated from the regions of East Anglia and greater London to realize their ideal of a Holy Commonwealth in the so-called New World. As ""visible"" saints, these individuals withdrew themselves from English cities to institute self-proclaimed cities of God on the ""untouched"" and ""pure"" shores of North America. The early seventeenth century saw waves of Puritans making the dangerous transatlantic crossing. However, unlike earlier migration movements where single young men dominated population outflows, families comprised the majority of Puritan migrants. With men immigrating to North America with their wives and children, settlers quickly outgrew their initial settlements and spread into the adjacent areas of the northeast. As God's elect who were chosen to live and model godly lives both individually and communally, more colonies formed and grew into what eventually became Connecticut, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Maine. By the early eighteenth century, the dissenting nature of Puritanism inevitably led to its own fragmentation as a homogenous group. Its ideals and ideologies were grafted into the tenets of Quakers, Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians, and other Protestant evangelical groups. Although Puritanism itself disappeared by the mid-eighteenth century, Puritans' characteristic moral rigour, self-reliance, and political localism remained distinctive amongst American colonists.",1560,1720,2350,1560,Bethany Henderson,1,M.

2271,The Gideons International in Ngeria,43,Religious Group (v6),"The entry relates to the establishment/inauguration of the Gideons International in Nigeria since 1964 and its growth and activities since then including the ways it has impacted the country and the extent of the success of its activities.
The Gideons International in Nigeria is an association of Christian Business and Professional men who have accepted the Lordship of Jesus and committed to making Christ known through their witnessing, association for Christ and the distribution of the Bibles in the traffic lanes of lives. Traffic lanes of life are places that the association believes that people will pass through at least once in their lifetime. These are schools, hospitals, hotels, motels, police and army formations as well as prisons. The ultimate aim of the association is that every soul encountered in the traffic lanes of life will come to the saving knowledge of the Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ. The association is a part of a worldwide association that operates in 199 countries of the world and distributes bibles printed in 109 different languages. The language of the Bible distributed in Nigeria is English. It came into being in the United States of America in 1899 through the  inspiration of God to John H Nicolson and Samuel E Hill. The name Gideons derives from the story of the Biblical Gideon in the sixth and seventh chapters of the Book of Judges. The Biblical Gideon was a man who was willing to do exactly what God wanted him to do, irrespective of his own judgement as to the plans or results. Humility, faith and obedience were his great elements of character, a standard that the Association is trying to establish in all its members. An integral part of the Association is the auxiliary, which comprises the wives of Gideons who meet the same spiritual qualifications. Ultimately, the association is a family ministry where every member of the family has a part. The Auxiliary are expected to be on their knees praying for the Gideons to be on their feet placing Bibles and witnessing. To be spiritually qualified to be a Gideon and a part of the association,  a person must believe in the Bible as the inspired Word of God, believe in the Lord Jesus Christ as the eternal Son of God, have received Jesus as his personal Saviour and endeavour to follow Him in his daily lives. In addition, a person must believe in the endless lake of fire for the unsaved, accept the Biblical standard of marriage being between one biological man and one biological woman. In addition he must be a member in good standing of an Evangelical or Protestant church, congregation or assembly and should willingly participate in the activities of a camp, a smaller units into which the association is divided.

Since 1964 when the first camp was established in Nigeria, there are 281 camps as at March 2024. These camps have been differently organised in the past as zones. They are now grouped into seven state structures namely South-West, Central-West, North-West, North-East, Central-East, South-East and Central-South each under the direction of a trustee who also doubles as the state president and who is responsible to a national cabinet elected annually at the national convention of the association. The national cabinet comprising the president, vice-president, treasurer secretary/executive director, chaplain and the seven state  trustees is complemented by the national auxiliary cabinet which comprises the auxiliary president, vice-president, secretary/treasurer and chaplain. The national cabinet operates  under the authority and direction of the International Cabinet which is also elected annually at the International convention. The national cabinet positions are replicated at the camp level but with programme leaders (church relations, faith fund, scripture distribution, gideoncard, membership) appointed. Regional Directors in state associations and Area leaders like Area Directors and programme leaders at the state and area levels are appointed.

2273,Yuan divination schools,43,Religious Group (v6),"Although some divination students were recorded in Dunhuang’s prefectural schools in the 10th century, it was in Yuan China that local divination schools were established by imperial order for the first time. From 1291 onward, Yuan rulers ordered the establishment of divination schools in various administrative units of the Yuan, from the route down to the subprefecture. Modeled on Confucian schools and medical schools, divination schools were headed by one or more divination instructors, selected for their expertise in divination. The highest ranked ones (9b) were appointed by the Directorates of Astronomy (sitiantai 司天臺) of the central bureaucracy while the lower-ranked ones were recommended by the locals. The Yuan divination school had multiple functions. First, they taught the three fundamental topics of divination (sanyuan 三元), namely geomancy of residence spaces (zhaiyuan 宅元), geomancy of burial site (yingyuan 塋元), and marriage divination (hunyuan 婚元). Second, they managed local diviners, organizing them for local services such as timekeeping. Third, they recommended qualified candidates to the Directorates of Astronomy, which had many activities related to various divination practices. Although not as systematically established as Confucian and medical schools (I have identified 150 divination schools according to the existence of school buildings or instructors), the divination school continued well into the Ming and the Qing periods. The institution’s connection to the Yuan divination households is not always clear. In some cases, the local divination school managed registered local divination households, while in other cases, the divination instructors did not necessarily come from a divination household. Some Yuan divination school instructors published books on the three fundamental topics of divination or on other divination practices, while others networked with local elites, prognosticating for them or writing stone inscriptions, etc. The establishment of local divination schools institutionalized the significance of the three fundamental topics of divination, in particular geomancy. It also strengthened divination instructors’ social status, making divination an alternative profession for traditional Confucian families.",1291,1368,2356,1603,Qiao Yang,45,Matthew Hamm,2024-03-24 15:15:56.735 +0100,2024-03-24 21:25:36.914 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),8.946914027525868e-45,7.173107464413674e-23,2.311826917497559e-132,3.599705772176862e-97,5.395495782663928e-17,1.0
2274,Ìjọ Àdìmúlà (An Institutionalised Indigenous Religious Movement in Yorubaland,43,Religious Group (v6),"Ìjọ Àdìmúlà is a unified movement of Yoruba traditional religion that sprung up in Ile-Ife under the leadership of Olorunfemi Osiiga an Ìjẹ̀bú man in the 1920s. The term Ìjọ means assembly while Àdìmúlà means ""The Personality one can hold on to and be saved"". the term has been adopted to describe Yoruba religion. Ìjọ Àdìmúlà started as a secessionist movement from Ìjọ Àdìmúlà ti Kŕstì (which was a Christian denomination). It was noted that Osiiga's goal was to create a purely Yoruba traditional religious worship system which has since spread to other Yoruba communities of southwestern, Nigeria. Ìjọ Àdìmúlà came into existence in some other communities as a need for social coercion for members of Yoruba indigenous religion. It was noted that the prevalence of Christianity in those communities was gradually driving indigenous religion into extinction which calls for a drastic reaction from practitioners of indigenous religion to have a voice. Such communities include Ọ̀là, Màsífà, Òkò, Èjìgbò, Òsogbo, among others.  Ìjọ Àdìmúlà gained more prominence in Ìlé-Ifẹ̀, Ọ̀là, Màsífà, and several others within Osun State. The membership of the group is drawn from every Yoruba religious group such as Ifá, Sàngó, Ọya, Egúngún, Ògún, and Obàtálá among others. The group population varies from one community to the other. For instance, Ilé-Ifẹ̀ has an average population of 220, Ọ̀là 750, and Màsífà 630 with women and children inclusive. Some of the distinctive features of Ìjọ Àdìmúlà to the different Yoruba religious groups are the creation of structures within the system, the use of documented text that has unarguably been associated with Yoruba indigenous religion, and the introduction of public service within modernised buildings called Ilé Ìjùbà (worship centres) as opposed to worship in shrines and groves. It is important to note that the temple is regarded as a sacred place where the divinities abide, because of this notion reference is accorded to the temple demonstrated by individual putting off their shoes before entering into the temple. Also individuals bow themselves touching the floor with their forehead in reverence to the divinities believed to be present in the temple.
The group structures comprise both administrative and spiritual: the administrative includes alàgbà tàbí Àwọn Àgbàgbà Ìjọ (Elders), Ìgbìmọ̀ Ìjọ (Council of the assembly), Àwọn Akọ̀wé Ìjọ (Secretaries and Treasurers of the Assembly), Ẹgbẹ́ Amú Ìjọ dùn (which they interpreted as Deacons and Deaconess), Ẹgbẹ́ Ọdẹ (Security); while the spiritual involves Adarí Ìjọ/Olórí Ìjọ (Leader of the Assembly), Asọsẹ Ìjọ (Preacher), Àwọn Ẹgbẹ́ Akọrin Ifágbayé, Ifálólayọ̀, Òdòdó/Ìràwọ̀ Ọrúnmìlà (Choir groups for married women, single ladies and the children respectively who dress in their different regalia), among others.
The group days of worship differ from one community to the other. It was gathered that Ìjọ Àdìmúlà in Ilé-Ifẹ̀ worship on Sunday while those in Màsífà and Ọ̀là worship on Saturday. The form of worship was purely liturgical although it allows for a bit of flexibility. The leading personnel reads from the worship guide while the congregation listens and responds at the appropriate places.
The content of the worship guide begins with a call to worship, then a processional hymn, and salutations to Olódùmarè, followed by other òrìsà of Yoruba which includes all deities and Orí (destiny) which is often regarded as one of the most important personal òrìsà among the Yoruba. This is followed by Ìwúre Ìbẹ̀ẹ̀rẹ̀ Ìsìn (Opening prayer) and other features such as Ọ̀rọ̀ Ìwúrí (sermon), Ìdáwó (collection of plates), Ìdúpẹ́ (thanksgiving), Orin láti ọ̀dọ Àwọn Akọrin (choir renditions) among others. It should be noted that Ifá corpus that are documented in the worship guide forms the major text of every sermon, however, the preacher is at liberty to recite any Odù Ifá (Ifa verse) he or she deems necessary for his sermon and close the service with a congregational prayer. The group in each community also has àjọ̀dún which is specific annual festival that they hold in high esteem.",1920,2023,2357,1602,Ebenezer Elesemoyo,57,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,2024-03-24 23:45:26.201 +0100,2024-03-25 21:45:25.888 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.35823011161619617,0.015710444456675472,0.6257590579414908,1.1638782972460149e-11,0.00030038597399875883,6.326192841427923e-32
2278,الطريقة القادرية البودشيشية في المغرب الأقصى,43,Religious Group (v6),"لطريقة القادرية البودشيشية طريقة صوفية مغربية، يوجد مقرها في قرية مداغ بإقليم بركان شرق المغرب  قرب الحدود المغربية الجزائرية،  في منطقة قبائل بني يزناسن . تنتسب إلى الشيخ عبد القادر الجيلاني الذي ظهر في القرن الخامس الهجري. أما لقب البودشيشية، فقد اكتسبه بواسطة الشيخ علي بن محمد الذي حمل لقب «سيدي علي بودشيش» لكونه كان يطعم الناس أيام المجاعة -طعام الدشيشة - بزاويته.
تؤمن البودشيشية -كغيرها من الطرق المنتسبة للتصوف- بمحورية الشيخ الذي يزوره المريدون من شتى البقاع لزيارته والتبرك برؤيته وبلمسه، فالمريد لا مفر له من وجود شيخ مربي، ""فكما أن المرء لا يرى عيوب وجهه إلا في مرآة صافية مستوية تكشف له عن حقيقة حاله، فكذلك لا بد للمؤمن من صاحب كامل يرى في كماله نقائص نفسه ليعالجها""، على حد تعبير أعضاء الطريقة.
وتشتهر الطريقة البودشيشية  بتنظيم لقاءين سنويين يحضرهما أكثر من 250 ألف شخص، من كل جهات المغرب الأقصى ومن أوروبا ومن امركا ومن آسيا  أولهما ليلة 27 من شهر رمضان المعظم التي يعتقد كثير من المسلمين أنها ليلة القدر، وثانيهما في ذكرى مولد رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم.
وبحسب أدبيات الطريقة، فللمريد آداب عليه الالتزام بها في علاقته بالشيخ، ومنها ""الامتثال لشيخه امتثال المريض لطبيبه""، و""أن يعتقد فيه تمام أهليته للتربية والإرشاد""، و""أن يكون صادقا في طلبه للحق مع تجريد إرادته عن الأغراض والمصالح""، وذلك إلى جانب ""أن يعظم شيخه ويحفظ حرمته حاضرا وغائبا""، و""أن يحسن الظن بإخوانه ولا يشتغل بعيوبهم ويكل أمرهم إلى الله تعالى""، و""أن يتواضع لهم وينظر إليهم بعين التعظيم حتى يستمد من أنوارهم"".
وبحسب الطريقة، فلا مناص من توفر أربعة شروط لكي يصل المرء إلى مرتبة ""شيخ الطريقة"" وينال مقام التربية والإرشاد، أولها العلم بـ""الفرائض العينية""، وثانيها ""أن يكون عارفا بالله""، والثالثة أن ""يكون خبيرا بطريقة تزكية النفوس""، ورابعتها ""أن يكون مأذونا في التربية والإرشاد"".
أبرز الشيوخ
من أبرز شيخ البودشيشية في القرن العشرين الشيخ المختار القادري بودشيش الذي اشتهر بمقاومته للاحتلال الفرنسي بقيادة الجنرال ليوطي الذي دخل المغرب من جهته الشرقية من الجزائر المحتلة وقتذاك، حيث التفت كثير من القبائل حول الشيخ المختار وحاربت المحتل الذي نجح في ضرب المقاومين واحتل المنطقة، وسرعان ما وصل إلى مقر الزاوية وخربها، واعتقل شيخها.
وبعد وفاة الشيخ أبو مدين القادري البودشيشي عام 1955 تولى زعامة الطريقة الشيخ العباس، واشتهرت الطريقة في عهده بشكل ملفت، وهو ما تعزز في عهد نجله الشيخ  حمزة القادري البودشيشي الذي تزعم الطريقة عام 1972 إثر وفاة والده.
عمل الشيخ حمزة -بحسب مصادر الطريقة- على تجديد أذكارها ""ونظم سيرها، مما زاد في إحيائها وتنشيطها""، وساهم في نشر الطريقة عبر المناطق المغربية المختلفة، علما بأن الساحة الصوفية في المغرب تشهد منافسة كبيرة  بين الطرق والزوايا، وفي مقدمتها الطريقة التيجانية

2279,The Ndau people of Chimanimani area in Zimbabwe,43,Religious Group (v6),"The identity of the Ndau people is rooted in the Mnonomotapa Empire before colonization. At the present moment the Ndau people are found both in Zimbabwe and Mozambique. In Zimbabwe Ndau people they occupy the south-eastern parts of the country. In Mozambique, the Ndau are found in areas facing the south-west, and their language is called Ndau. The Ndau people specifically occupy the Chimanimani and Chipinge districts in Zimbabwe. That area was formerly called Gazaland In the present day, this is largely a rural area which still needs considerable development. They were named the Ndau because they say Ndau-wee when welcoming or greeting a visitor into their homestead. This is still their practice in the present day. The term has also a geopolitical dimension. The term Ndau denotes space, and in this regard, the term may raise issues to do with a claim to ownership of their space. The language they speak is also called Ndau. Some people also contend that they were named after their language. Social structures and cultural norms serve to unite and bind together the Ndau people. There has not been much change in the way social and cultural activities are practised.  Several of the customs in place in the twentieth century, such as the burial and succession of chiefs, are similar to those practiced centuries earlier. While there has been a few changes with time, the changes have are still applicable and relevant for the present Ndau people. These traditions in Ndau history serve as cultural materials that define aspects of a scripted Ndau identity. Amongst the Ndau people are also special religious specialists who assist the community indigenous knowledge system. Some of the specialists include midwives, n’anga, rain makers and chiefs. These specialists are crucial in preserving both cultural values and the environment. The religious specialists assist the community with the utilization of natural resources responsibly as they strongly believe that the earth or environment is capable of regenerating itself.The Ndau people operate under the influence of a patriarchal social system which upholds the rule and control of men. Men dominate, while women and children are just followers. It is men who hold all decision-making powers, while women and children do not have access to such powers. Women generally do not have a voice to crucial decisions in life. This has resulted in a culture of silence among women in Chimanimani. However the history of these people is highly debatable as there are number of contradictions between narratives from oral tradition and written documents.",1890,2024,2360,1437,TERENCE MUPANGWA,57,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,2024-03-27 08:51:52.919 +0100,2024-03-29 19:08:23.415 +0100,Personal Expertise,0.9805075708834439,0.01883265767362505,2.9983403516603283e-21,1.4082034773405752e-12,0.0006597714415227955,1.2957502155450962e-20

•	 القادرية الفارضية: وهى الأقدم عهداً بمصر، ترجع جذورها التاريخية إلى القرن السابع الهجرى، ومقرها بجامع السادة القادرية بالقرافة الصغرى بالقاهرة، وهو مسجدٌ عتيق تفوح منه رائحة القرون، وكان المسجد قد بُنى فى القرن السابع ليكون زاويةً للشيخ «عدىّ بن مسافر» أحد تلاميذ الإمام الجيلانى، وبمجىء حفيد الإمام الجيلانى (علاء الدين علىّ القادرى) الذى استوطن مصر مع أسرته، منذ القرن الثامن الهجرىأصبحت مدينة القرافة مركزا للقادرية أما لقب «الفارضية» فهو مستمدٌّ من أحد مشايخ الطريقة المتأخرين، هو حفيد الإمام الجيلانى: محمد بن سليمان، الملقَّب بالفارضى، لأنه كان يتولَّى إثبات فروض النساء على الرجال، وهى وظيفة شرعية قديمة، منها اشتُق أيضاً لقب شاعر الصوفية الأشهر: ابن الفارض
•	 القادرية القاسمية: وهى ثانية الطرق القادرية المسجَّلة اليوم بالمجلس الأعلى للطرق الصوفية. وهى فرع عتيق من القادرية بمصر، ذكر المستشرق الفرنسى المرموق «لوى ماسينيون» أنها وفدت إلى مصر فى القرن التاسع عشر، لكن هناك عديداً من الشواهد، تدل على أنها أقدم من ذلك عهداً بالبلاد.. وقد ذكر  شيخ القادرية القاسمية (نسبة إلى قاسم الكبير) قصة غريبة تؤرخ لبداية هذه الطريقة بمصر، هى حسبما يحكى الشيخ: دخلت امرأةٌ على الإمام الجيلانى فى مدرسته ببغداد، تشكو إليه مرضاً عضالاً كان الأطباء قد وصفوا لعلاجه الرُّمان، ولم يكن الوقت أوان رُمَّان، فأسرع «عيسى» ابن الإمام الجيلانى، ومَدَّ يده فى الهواء وأحضر لها رُمَّانة! فقال له الإمام الجيلانى إن بغداد لن تسعهما معاً، وأمرَه بنـزول مصر، فبدأت الطريقة القادرية القاسمية فى مصر على يديه! وقد تولى  فرع القادرية القاسمية بالفيوم،في الفترة الحديثة  شيخٌ على درجة عالية من العلم والمعرفة، هو الشيخ «محمود عبدالتواب الفَزَارى» الذى كان قد تلقى معالم الطريق الصوفى من والده، ودرس فى الأزهر، ثم درس الجيولوجيا فى جامعة الإسكندرية وحصل على الماجستير فى الجيولوجيا التطبيقية من جامعة يزيربورج الألمانية.. وعاد إلى الفيوم فاستصلح أرضاً كثيرة للزراعة، وأقام رباطات صوفية عديدة فى صحراء الفيوم.
•	 القادرية الشرعية: فى أعماق مسجد الإمام الشعرانى بالقاهرة، ينتصب فرعٌ من فروع القادرية بمصر، كان قد وفد من بلاد المغرب مع الشيخ «عبد المنعم القادرى» الذى تلقى الطريق عن شيخه محمد حبيب الله الشنقيطى، الذى تلقاه بدوره عن شيخه المجاهد العظيم: ماء العينين القادرى، وإذ يستوقفنا هنا سبب تسمية هذه الطريقة، بالقادرية (الشرعية) فإن شيخ الطريقة المشار إليه قبل قليل، يقول فى كتابه «الركائز الإيمانية» إن تسمية طريقته مستمد من الأوراد الشرعية التى أُلهم بجمعها، ولا تخرج فى جملتها عن الكتاب والسنة.
•	القادرية النيازية:  وهذا الفرع القادرى متصل النسب بالإمام الجيلانى عن طريق ولده الشيخ عبدالرزاق. والقادرية النيازية وفدت إلى مصر من تركيا، منذ قرابة خمسة قرون، فقد نزل بعض شيوخها الأوائل فى النصف الثانى من القرن العاشر الهجرى، واستوطنوا الإسكندرية منذ ذلك التاريخ. ومن أبرز شيوخ هذا الفرع القادري في الفترة الحديثة الشيخ إبراهيم حلمى القادرى.. وهو سكندرى المولد والمنشأ والإقامة والوفاة! فقد ولد بالإسكندرية فى 16 محرم سنة 1322 هجرية، وتلقى الرعاية من أفراد البيت القادرى الذى نشأ فيه، وظل متولِّياً مشيخة الطريقة من وفاة والده سنة 1355، وحتى انتقاله إلى جوار رَبِّه وهو ساجدٌ يصلى بمريديه تراويح ليلة القدر سنة 1390 هجرية.وكان الشيخ مدرسةً صوفيةً جمعت أشتات المعارف الدينية، وفى هذه المدرسة تخرج رجال.. كما ترك الشيخ العديد من المؤلفات، منها ما هو مطبوع ومتداول، ومنها  ما يزال مخطوطا  وقد نصَّ الشيخ إبراهيم حلمى القادرى على تولية ولده (محمد) قبل انتقاله إلى جوار ربه.",1200,2024,2372,1550,ltaief zorgui,55,Julian Weideman,2024-04-01 00:56:37.506 +0200,2024-04-01 00:56:37.506 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),1.6853346633433227e-35,0.9999999762000472,2.399017184985751e-36,1.4914399467551208e-36,1.1113016895006973e-17,2.3799952693651582e-08
2297,Waldensians (Waldenses),43,Religious Group (v6),"The Waldensians, or the Waldenses, were members of an ascetic Christian movement that originated in Lyon, France during the twelfth-century. Peter Valdes (or Waldo), a formerly wealthy merchant from Lyon, is attributed as the founder of this so-called proto-Protestant sect in pre-Reformation Europe. Eager to acquire knowledge for biblical teaching, Waldo organized the translation of the four Gospels from Latin into Arpitan (a Frano-Provinçial dialect). Around 1170, after reading the account of Jesus and the rich young ruler (Matthew 19:16-30, Mark 10:17-31, Luke 18:18-30), Waldo sold his possessions and gave all he had to the poor. Waldo was especially struck by the verse, ""If you want to be perfect, go and sell your property and give the money to the poor"" (Matt. 19:21); to which Waldo (and his followers) practiced literally. Waldo began preaching as a layman in Lyon (1170-1176) and quickly attracted a following in southern France. His movement became known as ""Paupers du Lugduno"" or ""The Poor of Lyon."" However, due to Waldo's scant theological training and use of a non-Latin translation of the Bible, ecclesiastical authorities had issue with his message. In 1179, Waldo attended the third Lateran Council in Rome and was confirmed in his vow of poverty by Pope Alexander III. At this council, he gave his Profession of Faith (which still exists): a statement of orthodox beliefs that individuals accused of heresy were required to sign. Waldo originally sought reform within the church and did not condone its destruction. Nevertheless, being dissatisfied with Rome's recognition of his movement's main message, he continued his ministry. His audacious defiance eventually led to the group's denouncement by the archbishop of Lyon, and were ascribed as a heretical sect by Pope Lucius III in his papal bull ""Ad abolendam"" (1184). Soon after their excommunication, Waldo and his followers formally departed from the tenets of the Roman Catholic Church. They rejected many of the seven sacraments, such as the practice of selling indulgences, the confession of one's sins to a priest, infant baptism and partial baptismal submersion, and the doctrine of transubstantiation. They also renounced the idea of purgatory, prayers for the dead, and the worship of saints. The organization of Waldo's movement reacted against the great ostentatious displays of the existing medieval church and the worldly depravities of its contemporary churchmen. As a staunch anticlerical group, the Waldensians believed the church had lost its spiritual life by becoming wealthy, powerful, and privileged. The Waldensians' emphasis on poverty was not perceived as a spiritual value, but as an exact evangelical design to model in one's life that stood in stark contrast with the church. To further reflect their lack of confidence in the ecclesiastical order, Waldo and his followers promoted the equitable participation of men and women in the preaching and teaching of the Bible. This challenged the church's monopoly on exclusively male priestly preaching by barring vernacular translations of the Latin Bible. By gaining access to the Word of God as laymen, Waldo and his followers accepted the Bible as the sole and total authority of all doctrine. They opted to hold simple services in their homes and outdoors to mirror the apostolic model of the early church. Over time, however, the French Catholic authorities persecuted the Waldensians to the point of the sword due to ongoing pressures from Rome. Many were forced to leave the diocese of Lyon and fled for safer haven in the Alpine region of Piedmont and Lombardy in northern Italy (to this day, the valleys of Val Pellice, Val Chisone, and Val Germanasca in Piedmont are known as ""Waldensian valleys""). Subsequent inquisitions and persecutions against the Waldensian heresy continued throughout the thirteenth-century, forcing many communities to flee and disband. The violence reached a peak in 1487 with Pope Innocent VIII's bill for the extermination of the Waldensian heresy. Several crusades were conducted against Waldensian communities which led to their virtual extermination in southern France and Lombardy. In 1532, the Waldensians joined the Protestant Reformation after hundreds of years of persecution. This new identify as a Protestant sect enabled them to receive support and political protection from Protestant nation-states, allowing the faith to endure into the modern era.",1173,1699,2375,1560,Bethany Henderson,1,M.

Though the term has a wider linguistic rendering in almost all the Bantu languages of Southern Africa, it has gained a lot of philosophical attention in Zimbabwe and South Africa, especially in the early twenty-first century for the simple reason that both Zimbabwe and South Africa needed home-grown philosophies to move forward following political disturbances that had been caused by the liberation war and apartheid respectively. Philosophically, the term Ubuntu emphasises the importance of a group or community and it finds its clear expression in the Nguni/Ndebele phrase: umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu which when translated to Shona means munhu munhu muvanhu (a person is a person through other persons).

2321,Falungong 法輪功 (Falun Gong) / Falun Dafa 法輪大法,43,Religious Group (v6),"Falungong 法輪功 (“Dharma Wheel Practice”), also romanized as Falun Gong and alternatively named Falun Dafa 法輪大法 (“Great Teachings of the Dharma Wheel”), was founded in 1992 by Li Hongzhi 李鴻志 (b. 1950 or 1951) in China’s northeastern Jilin Province 吉林省. What sets it apart from other Qigong groups of that time is its unique blend of traditions. In addition to creatively interpreting physical and spiritual self-cultivation practices from Daoist and Buddhist antecedents, Li’s teachings also draw on messianic and apocalyptic tropes from China’s rich sectarian traditions, Western New Age, and the belief in the interference of aliens. The practice centers on the idea of a revolving “dharma wheel” (falun 法輪) that Li plants inside the practitioner’s abdomen, which, being stimulated through Falungong practice, can absorb and emit energy. Even though different in terms of conceptualization, the symbol of the “dharma wheel” (Skt. dharmacakra) is borrowed from Buddhism, where it is used to represent the Buddhist teachings.
At the same time, Falungong is much more than a set of physical and spiritual regimens of self-actualization. Instead, the doctrines put forth in Li’s core scriptures, especially Zhuan Falun 轉法輪 (The Dharma Wheel Revolves), center on the tripartite moral concept of zhen 真 (truth or truthfulness), shan 善 (compassion, goodness), and ren 忍 (forbearance). They are the very nature of the cosmos and the organizing principle of all things. Because humans and all living beings have been morally corrupted when they entered the mundane world, their greed and attachment bound them to the endless cycle of transmigration (the Buddhist concept of saṃsāra), which is why this primordial perfect state has been forgotten. Falungong practitioners aspire to actualize their inherent moral potential. Accordingly, zhen, shan, and ren represent not only ethical qualities for individuals and society at large but also cosmological properties. Furthermore, Li’s writings are emersed in apocalyptic themes, messianic tropes, and morally conservative ideals that strongly oppose modern Western liberal values. Accordingly, several researchers have noted that some of Li’s teachings are not merely conservative but inherently racist, misogynist, sexist, and homophobic.
The history of Falungong is deeply tied to the post-Mao Qigong craze that swept the country until the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) crackdown on the movement ended this wave in the late 1990s. Qigong 氣功 (“Qi practice”) is based on much older traditions of bodily and spiritual practices related to physical care, but, as a modernized system, it was specifically created in 1949 by CCP researchers to provide a reasonable solution to the pressing issues of public health. At that time, the party sought to bereave these practices of all religious and spiritual elements because they were deemed “feudal superstitions” and “backward elements.” In the post-Mao period, however, Qigong experienced a nuanced spiritual turn. During the 1980s and 1990s, the Qigong movement was instrumental in fostering what is generally referred to as the period of the “religious fever” (zongjiaore 宗教熱), during which diverse religious and spiritual movements tried to fill the ideological void created by the disappearance of high Maoism.
Within a few years, Falungong became one of China’s most successful Qigong movements, and by the late 1990s, it had already spread to other countries. At that time, the CCP estimated between 2.1 and 2.3 million followers in China alone. Retrospectively, Falungong sources claim up to 80 million followers at that time. However, these numbers are not grounded in solid statistics but seem motivated by the desire to outnumber the CCP, which had approximately 58 to 63 million members during the late 1990s and early 2000s. In the wake of the 1999 crackdown and the ongoing anticampaign in China, many practitioners were forced underground, forsake their faith publicly, or leave the country. Since then, Falungong has emerged as a global movement with local chapters in various countries. New York City represents the crucial hub in the movement’s transnational network, probably because Li and his family moved there in 1996. Accordingly, it comes as no surprise that the Falungong headquarters, “Dragon Springs” (Longquan 龍泉), is located in Orange County, New York. Furthermore, most internet outlets and affiliated enterprises—such as the print and online newspaper The Epoch Times (established in August 2000), the broadcasting company “New Tang Dynasty TV” (since February 2002), and the publishing house Minghui—are all but located in New York. 
Today, Falungong and its affiliated enterprises are a transnational conglomerate that includes media enterprises, public relations firms, and commercial operations. These enterprises and Falungong’s extensive volunteer mobilization culture support the movement’s more significant cause of unmasking the Communist regime in Beijing and its atrocities. Even though many of these are well-documented, critical voices lament that the movement’s strongly biased perspective and hardline anticommunist agenda represent a propagandistic approach by itself. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Falungong received international media coverage after over 10,000 participants assembled in front of the CCP headquarters at Zhongnanhai 中南海, next to the Forbidden City in Beijing, on April 25, 1999, to peacefully demonstrate for the release of fellow practitioners who had been incarcerated a few days earlier. Even though this unprecedented event caught the CCP off guard, party and government institutions and media outlets instigated the largest anti-campaign in PRC history in only three months. Because the number of those affected by this ongoing campaign released by the government and by Falungong activists differ significantly, there is only little reliable information. According to activists, five thousand practitioners were killed in these campaigns until June 2023, and there are hundreds of thousands, if not millions, who were detained to “labor reeducation” or were subject to torture, abuse, and organ harvesting. Yet, the scope of organ harvesting and the existence of specific “concentration camps” is cast into doubt by some scholars and human rights activists.
From the early stage of Falungong’s resistance against the CCP, activists used the Internet to pursue global activism. Only a few months after the June 1999 crackdown, practitioners in the United States founded the website “Clear Wisdom” (minghuiwang 明慧網), which is specially designed to track the evolving campaign and its response by Falungong activists worldwide. The site is currently (as of April 2024) available in 22 different languages, which further attests to the movement’s global appeal. In August 2000, practitioners founded The Epoch Times (Dajiyuan 大紀元), which quickly evolved into the most widely distributed Chinese newspaper in North America and, since 2016, has shifted towards ultraconservative and far-right topics in their Western-language editions in the United States and Europe. Today, Falungong-affiliated media enterprises comprise various websites, newspapers, news portals (Radio Free Asia), and streaming services (such as Epoch TV) that rally the movement’s greater cause to win the support of ultraconservative Christians and other right-wing forces to form an anti-China coalition.",1992,2024,2399,1595,Nikolas Broy,45,Matthew Hamm,2024-04-07 00:20:26.596 +0200,2024-04-08 19:16:49.354 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),7.397175914923591e-13,3.050261081837575e-14,1.1411722453067022e-34,1.9792454578184722e-23,0.9999999999981882,1.0416457103084236e-12

2325,"Outer alchemy (外丹, waidan)",43,Religious Group (v6),"Outer Alchemy (外丹, waidan), corresponding to Inner alchemy (内丹, Neidan), is a Daoist doctrine and methodology focused on cultivating personal morality and compounding elixirs (jin/golden cinnabar) from minerals, metals, and herbs for the sake of conferring longevity and immortality. Outer alchemy is based on Laozi's ""Dao"" philosophy, adding Zhuangzi 's transcendental thought and Zhang Daoling's mystical theory, and advocates practitioners to cultivate immortality (修仙, xiuxian) by training Confucian ethics, valuing the dao (道), refining and ingesting elixir. In practitioners’ faith, elixirs can activate and nourish qi (氣, energy), thereby vitalizing the people’s physical health and attain mental transcendence. Outer alchemy had been mentioned during the Western Han Dynasty (202 BC – 9 AD) by esoterica masters (方士,  fangshi ) and written in Yantie lun (《鹽鐵論》, Discourses on Salt and Iron, ca. 60 BCE.), Hongbao yuanbi shu (《鴻寶苑祕術 》, Arts from the Garden of Secrets of the Vast Treasure), Hanshu (《漢書》), many  Taiqing 太清 Daoism text, especially in Ge Hong’s Baopuzi (《抱朴子》, He Who Holds to Simplicity). Outer alchemy developed mostly during the Tang Dynasty, however, the abuse of elixirs led to unexpected deaths of Emperor Wuzong (r. 840–46), Xuanzong (r. 846–59), and possibly also Xianzong (r. 805–20). From the late Tang onward, outer alchemy gradually declined.
Ge Hong (also Ko Hung 葛洪, 283-343 CE, Danyang, Jiangsu) is one the most well-known Waidan masters. His main text, Baopuzi, consists of Neipian (内篇, “20 Inner Chapters”, focusing on alchemical studies and the pursuit of immortality) and Waipian (外篇, “50 Outer Chapters”, stressing the importance of Confucian ethic cultivation of the secular lives). Against the background of the long period of chaos (220-589 CE), Ge Hong founded esoteric studies, immortality cultivation and outer alchemy based on the natural principle of “metamorphoses” (變化, bianhua)"". Ge considered this profane world is not “closed, final, and perpetual reality”; instead, it is “infinite, boundless, and endless world of new things” that only transcended immortals (xian, 仙) could access. Transcended immortals, in Ge’s thought, are “non-aging, non-dying” beings who are living in the fairy world of eternal happiness. A man must maintain his purity (especially the Confucian concept of benevolence (仁ren)) before cultivating immortality. Ge concluded that dao is the ""root"" and ru is the ""branch.""

2327,ỌBÀTÁLA RELIGIOUS GROUP AMONG THE YORUBA OF ILÉ-IFẸ̀,43,Religious Group (v6),"ỌBÀTÁLA RELIGIOUS GROUP AMONG THE YORUBA OF ILÉ-IFẸ̀
The Ọbàtálá religious group forms one of the cardinal traditional religious groups among the Yoruba in southwestern Nigeria. Just like most other groups, it is affiliated with one of the primordial deities in the Yoruba pantheon. Ọbàtálá is also called Òrìsà ńlá. Ọbàtálá is believed among the Yoruba of Ile-Ife to be the arch divinity whom Olódùmarè (the Supreme Being in Yoruba cosmology) saddled with the responsibility of creation of all that exists. It was noted that Ọbàtálá overindulged himself in drinking palm wine, he then stepped aside to drink wine which resulted in him sleeping off. Having slept off, another deity Odùduwà picked up the item and proceeded to carry out the assignment having heard Olódùmarè while instructing Ọbàtálá. When Ọbàtálá woke from his sleep, he discovered the situation and forbade himself and his children from ever taking palm wine. As a result, members of the group are forbidden from drinking palm wine. Another version of the Yoruba mythology notes that despite his failure in creating the universe, he was still responsible for the creation of humans. The Yoruba people believe that Olódùmarè has much trust in Ọbàtálá's creativity and capacity. Therefore, He did not commit much time into supervising and inspecting the humans he moulded before breading life into them. The myth states that Ọbàtálá's negligence resulted in creating some humans with deformities. The Yoruba classify albinos, one legged, hunchback, blind and other physical disabilities as deformities resulting from Ọbàtálá's defective creation. This act, the Yoruba traditionally hold as being responsible for the existence of people with different disabilities. In Yoruba parlance therefore, individuals with physical disabilities are referred to as ẹni Òrìsà which means the people of Òrìsà (Ọbàtálá being the Òrìsà).
The group believes that Ọbàtálá being the arch divinity embraces all other deities. This is demonstrated with the presence of shrines dedicated to some other deities in Ọbàtálá compound. 
Ọbàtálá is regarded as the essence of justice, purity, and clear thinking. He is wisdom personified and also represents cleanliness and calmness. His wisdom and cleanness results in his use of a white robe which is also replicated by members of the group. While his adherents are permitted to use other colours, places such as shrines that are considered sacred among the group can only be accessed by individuals arrayed in white clothing alone. The group's adherence to cleanliness as exemplified in Ọbàtálá also makes it sacrosanct for anyone who would enter the compound or the palace of Ọbàtálá in Igbó-Ìtàpá in Ilé-Ifẹ̀ to put off their shoes at the gate before entry.
The group worships Ọbàtálá following the Yoruba indigenous (traditional) calendar which comprises five days each week. The group also observes vigils. The Ọbàtálá worshipers have houses built as palaces and halls for worship among others. The group also established schools like Ọbàtálá Nursery and Primary School, Igbó-Ìtàpá, Ilé-Ifẹ̀ where indigenous knowledge (Òrìsà related topics) and western education subjects are taught. The group also ‘has shrines where sacrifices are offered to Ọbàtálá. It is believed that children of Ọbàtálá are easily prone to stress and deadlines which often result in mental stress. However, this is often taken care of with the purchase of two coconuts, one will be offered to Ọbàtálá while two holes will be punched in the other through which the fluid inside the coconut will be poured into a cup and applied into the person's scalp for some hours or overnight. The group maintains that once this is done, the individual will surely recover due to the calming effects of the procedure.",1900,2024,2406,1602,Ebenezer Elesemoyo,57,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,2024-04-10 11:52:47.739 +0200,2024-04-28 14:32:33.014 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.9965655386180258,0.0008171074562914731,2.5360830075695355e-32,2.9007557178496957e-13,0.002617353925392704,9.5736850243956e-20
2328,Church of Almighty God (Quannengshen jiaohui 全能神教會) / Eastern Lightning (Dongfang shandian 東方閃電),43,Religious Group (v6),"The “Church of Almighty God” (Quannengshen jiaohui 全能神教會), also known as “Eastern Lightning” (Dongfang shandian 東方閃電), is a Protestant-inspired religious organization in post-Mao China and among Chinese diasporas worldwide. Its popular nickname, “Eastern Lightning,” derives from Matthews 24:27, which prophesizes the future advent of God: “For as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.” In line with earlier Chinese Christian communities, the Church of Almighty God (CAG) understands this iconic quotation as referring to the second advent of Christ as taking place in China. According to its teachings, Christ has already revealed himself, incarnated as a woman from central China. More importantly, practitioners believe that the Second Christ has revealed a new set of scriptures that supersede the conventional teachings, values, and practices codified in the Bible. Resembling traditional Chinese sectarian concepts of three stages in cosmic history (such as in Xiantiandao and Yiguandao), the Second Christ’s activities mark the third period in God’s scheme, which is the “Age of the Kingdom” (guodu shidai 國度時代).
The CAG emerged in the milieu of Protestant-inspired new religious groups and underground churches in post-Mao China, a time marked by the rise of the Qigong wave and the emergence of Falungong 法輪功. Departing from conventional Protestantism, many Protestant-inspired groups sought to adapt Christian teachings to Chinese contexts by adding other symbols, teachings, and practices. For instance, many cherish steadfast faith as the central pillar of individual practice and well-being, and they promote an apocalyptic and millenarian understanding of the Christian tradition. Despite the abundance of material related to matters of faith provided online by the CAG, little is known of daily religious life in its communities. From what we know, the church promotes an iconoclastic framework that applies to standard Christian rituals and festivals (such as Christmas, Easter, or communion) and Chinese traditional festivals and cultural practices. Meetings do not seem to follow a formal liturgy for worship. Rather, members listen to sermons and share their thoughts and experiences afterward. Accordingly, writing and publishing testimonies, primarily through CAG websites, is among the most cherished practices of pious adepts. Most of them relate to spiritual journeys and how steadfast faith in the powers of Almighty God was instrumental in overcoming hardships. 
Even though the names of the founder and other leaders are almost absent from CAG material, it seems that it was founded by Zhao Weishan 趙維山 (b. 1951), a man from the northeastern Chinese province of Heilongjiang 黑龍江省. Before founding CAG in Henan Province 河南省, central China, in ca. 1991, he was affiliated with various Protestant-inspired groups in the late 1980s. It was he who declared a woman as the second incarnation of Christ. Usually, her name is absent from CAG material as well. In 2012, Chinese authorities revealed her purported identity as Yang Xiangbin 楊向彬 (b. 1973) from Shanxi Province 山西省 (just north of Henan), but this claim has not been corroborated by the CAG and academic scholars. Interpreted as the “utterances of Christ of the last days,” the Second Christ’s speeches were collected and evolved into the group’s focal scripture Hua zai roushen xianxian 話在肉身顯現 (The Word Appears in the Flesh). At the moment, it consists of two volumes: the first comprises texts from 1991 to 1997; the second was published in 2014 and has since outranked the first as the more authoritative scripture. Remarkably, in this volume and other recent publications, the role of the female Christ seems to have shrunk compared to that of Almighty God.
Like many other Protestant-inspired groups, the CAG was declared an “evil cult” (xiejiao 邪教) in 1995. Even though robust statistics are not available and CAG activists sometimes report contradictory figures, several crackdowns by the Chinese government seem to have resulted in the detainment of up to hundreds of thousands of people. Moreover, according to CAG activists, at least dozens of practitioners have been killed by the authorities or died during detention. According to ethnographic research and unconfirmed claims, Zhao and the female Christ escaped to the United States in the early 2000s. 
During the 1990s and 2000s, the CAG seems to have been strongest in Henan and neighboring provinces, many of which are considered rural and poor compared to the fancy global metropolises of Shanghai, Beijing, and Shenzhen. Initially, most practitioners appeared to be elderly and often illiterate women, but more recent research indicates that the CAG also thrives in metropolitan areas. In 2014, the Chinese authorities estimated there would be 4 million practitioners in China, but these high numbers are likely exaggerated by public security institutions to justify the harsh measures. Due to the ongoing suppression of the church, during the past decade, considerable communities have also been established by refugees in South Korea, the Philippines, and the United States. 
The church is well-known for its opposition to conventional Christians unwilling to accept the superiority of their new revelations, for which they are labeled as “fake” or “anti-Christ” (jiajidu / dijidu 假基督／敵基督). Similarly, practitioners conceive of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) as the “great red dragon” (dahonglong 大紅龍) mentioned in Revelation 12, i.e., an incarnation of Satan. Accordingly, the church’s confrontation with the Party attains an eschatological meaning. Probably for these reasons, the CAG is a highly controversial organization in China and beyond. Chinese Christians and the government have blamed it for its allegedly coercive proselytization strategies, kidnapping, maltreatment, violence, and even involvement in a highly publicized homicide. On May 28, 2014, a group of six who allegedly belonged to the church killed a saleswoman in a McDonald’s restaurant in eastern China’s Zhaoyuan City 招遠市 (Shandong Province 山東省). The authorities were quick to blame the crime on the CAG, but close scrutiny by Western scholars suggests that the group was not a part of the church anymore or never has been. Still, the McDonald’s murder incident has firmly established the church’s negative image in the Chinese public, but also in Western media. 
Like in the case of Falungong, the Internet plays a pivotal role in the CAG’s activities: to circulate the scriptures and messages and to sustain a globally dispersed community. Besides archiving free books and other readings, especially testimonies, CAG websites provide many other services in different languages (41, at the moment of writing), including music videos, movies, sermons, hotlines, and a mobile phone app. In addition, the church also operates YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram accounts.",1991,2024,2407,1595,Nikolas Broy,45,Matthew Hamm,2024-04-11 02:13:55.689 +0200,2024-04-11 02:16:15.152 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),7.521210228922201e-24,1.065350763355858e-25,2.244467516264641e-23,0.9997192968501666,0.00028070314983347705,1.3792907679597546e-31
2329,Hòa Hảo,43,Religious Group (v6),"Hòa Hảo is a Vietnamese Buddhist religious movement that was founded in 1939 by Pontiff Huỳnh Phú Sổ (Huỳnh Phú Sở) in Hòa Hảo village, Tân Châu district, Châu Đốc province (current name: Phú Mỹ town, Phú Tân district, An Giang Province). Hòa Hảo Buddhism was also one of the millenarian sectarian movements in southern Vietnam in 19th and 20th centuries. Born into a wealthy family as a fragile boy, Huỳnh Phú Sổ often needed medical assistance from different healers in the Mekong Delta region, and especially those from the sacred mountains of Thất Sơn (Seven Mountains). After a bodily collapse, he claimed himself to be the reincarnation of Đức Phật Thầy Tây An (the Buddha Master of Western Peace). The Buddha Master’s real name was Đoàn Minh Huyên, who founded Bửu Sơn Kỳ Hương religion (Strange Fragrance from the Precious Mountain) in mid-19th century. Huỳnh Phú Sở gained popularity and attracted followers by the same methods of Đoàn Minh Huyên: predicting apocalyptic events, preaching religious philosophy, and healing a large number of people. Huỳnh Phú Sở had written Hòa Hảo Buddhist scriptures in verses and in literature texts (Sấm Giảng) during 1939-1947 before disappeared in an unclarified event. The circumstance around his death was contested, but his disappearance gave rise to debates about his alleged position towards Vietnamese Communist Forces (Việt Minh). The event took place in the power struggle context of southern Vietnam: imperialism, millenarian, colonization, nationalism, and later, the southern Buddhist Reform in 1930 (Chấn Hưng Phật Giáo). Caught in a conflicting position with different regimes, Hòa Hảo Buddhism has redefined and renewed its political and religious positions since 1937. The current Vietnamese government acknowledged Hòa Hảo Buddhism as a state-recognized religious group in 1999. Even though there are many different Hòa Hảo groups, The Central Executive Committee of Hòa Hảo Buddhism (Ban Trị Sự Trung Ương Phật Giáo Hòa Hảo) is the only recognized group who has headquarter in An Hòa Tự Temple in Phú Mỹ town, Phú Tân district, An Giang Province.

2330,Evangelical Church Winning All,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Evangelical Church Winning All, was until the year 2011 known as the Evangelical Church of West Africa. It is one of the largest Christian denominations in Nigeria. Its presence is overwhelming in Northern Nigeria as it has the largest membership of indigenous groups in that region of the country. Its membership strength is in excess of six million registered followers. The Christian group that is today called ECWA was introduced to Africa by Walter Gowans, Rowland Bingham of Canada and Thomas Kent of the United States through the Sudan Interior Mission in 1893. However, when the missionaries decided to hand over the SIM related churches to indigenous leadership in 1954, ECWA became the umbrella group through which the SIM-related churches (initially in Nigeria) came together to form an indigenous body. From this time, mission stations, seminaries and bible Schools, educational institutions and hospitals and other healthcare facilities came under the control of the ECWA leadership.

It is instructive to note that the vision for SIM, and by extension, ECWA was first born in the heart of a woman called Margaret (Craig) Gowans. Margaret, born in 1836 in Hamilton, Lanarkshire, Scotland was married to a brewer from Kilmarnock by the name, John Gowans (1836-1906) in 1861. She was the first individual in SIM history to conceive a vision to take the gospel to the Soudan. Her vision crystalized into the formation of ECWA and by extension the influence of the Christian group in the Muslim dominated northern Nigeria. Mr. and Mrs. John Gowan’s marriage was blessed with nine children. When the family emigrated to Toronto, Canada, in 1879, Mrs. Gowans began to fervently believe that a world-wide missions was an important part of the church’s work. She played a significant part in influencing two of their children to become missionaries. Annie, their oldest child travelled to China in 1892 while Walter, her fifth, went to the Sudan a year later. Bingham was reported to have recalled an important conversation he had with Mrs. Gowans when she proudly informed him that her son had been called to go to the Sudan where 60-90 million people “lived without a single Christian missionary.” She was instrumental to the challenge which her son Walter, his friend Thomas Kent and later Roland Bingham took up to embrace God’s heart (missions) for the people of Soudan. Their pioneering work of taking the Gospel to those of that region was one of Mrs. Gowan’s idea.
The acronym SIM first stood for “Soudan Interior Mission,” Soudan was an older variant of the Sudan region of West Africa. After various name changes, mergers and collaborations the mission agreed to go by the name “SIM” today. In French-speaking countries it is called “Société Internationale Missionnaire.” It comprises united organizations which were founded over a 100 years ago. The membership of this association includes Africa Evangelical Fellowship, Andes Evangelical Mission, International Christian Fellowship and Sudan Interior Mission.
The church has grown and spread its branches across most States of northern Nigeria being about the most visible Christian denomination in most parts of the region where the influence of Islam is overwhelming. It has suffered countless violent attacks from Islamic fundamentalists but has refused to give up on its ambition of making disciples of all nations where it is found. In recent times, it also began to make vigorous attempts at launching its mission works to other parts of Nigeria, Africa and beyond. The church has a well structured administrative apparatus. Its headquarters is located in Jos, Plateau State in northcentral Nigeria and it is headed by a President. There are four other key officers of the church who administer the affairs of the ministry. They all work from the Jos headquarters of the ministry. The church has been involved in giving education to the nation's youths since its advent in the country. It started with primary and secondary education, nursing and teacher training before recently establishing two universities for training youths in various vocations of their choice. In the area of health care, the church is known to have founded and effectively managed hospitals, health cantres and other health promoting facilities across the country. The church also has well funded seminaries and training colleges for training their clergy who serve as ministers, missionaries and church workers across their numerous branches.",1893,2024,2256,1526,Oyeyemi Oyekan,57,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,2024-04-11 11:15:28.083 +0200,2024-04-30 07:21:10.757 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.10289570404474999,0.0027358469064437934,0.7991461272260284,0.09521348226147294,8.839561304797324e-06,2.7515748570704356e-34

2332,Religion in the Minaean kingdom,43,Religious Group (v6),"In the region of Wādī al-Jawf in northwestern Yemen, five city-states thrived during the first half of the 1st millennium BCE: Nashshān, Kamna, Haram, Maʿīn (with its capital city called Qarnā), and Inabbaʾ. The earliest archaeological and epigraphic evidence from this area indicates a specific cultural and religious landscape within Ancient South Arabia. Each city-state had its own pantheon, alongside sharing a few major pan-South Arabian gods’ cults. The anthropomorphic nature of these deities is evidenced by their representation, accompanied by captions bearing their names, on the pillars of an intra-moenia temple in Nashshān dating back to the 8th century BCE.
During the 7th and 6th centuries BCE, the kingdom of Maʿīn gradually asserted itself as the primary political entity in the Jawf region, encompassing the previously Sabean town of Yathill and its surrounding territory. Here, the Minaeans established two significant cult sites: a temple at Shaqab al-Manaṣṣa and a sanctuary at Darb aṣ-Ṣabī, where expiatory and healing rituals took place. Temples dedicated to the main gods Wadd, ʿAthtar dhu-Qabḍ, and Nakraḥ were restored in Yathill and Qarnā during the latter half of the 1st millennium BCE, coinciding with the Minaeans’ dominance in the international trade of aromatic substances from South Arabia. Sacred sites for Minaean gods were also established in trading outposts along caravan routes in Central and Northern Arabia, such as Qaryat al-Fāw and Dadan. Minaean commercial routes extended to Egypt, where a Minaean oversaw the importation of aromatic substances for local temples, as evidenced by the funerary inscription written on his sarcophagus. An altar with a Minaic dedicatory inscription to Wadd and the other Minaean gods was even discovered on the island of Delos.
Similar to South Arabian religion overall, reconstructing the Minaean religious system is hindered by the scarcity of sources. The limited archaeological investigations in the area have provided nonetheless interesting insights into the local religious architecture and material culture. As regards written evidence, no mythological texts are known; ritual information is derived from few oracular texts recorded on wooden sticks, likely preserved in temple archives, and from the wider epigraphic evidence. Dedications to deities form the prevalent category of texts, but interactions with the divine are present in nearly every type of textual production. Many decrees are attributed to the gods, and gods are frequently invoked to protect individuals and goods in the closing sections of construction texts. Additionally, the Minaean corpus features the so-called ‘expiation’ inscriptions, detailing rituals performed to appease gods after collective or individual transgressions. Inscriptions also enable the reconstruction of a rich theonomastic repertoire. The names of the gods often include epithets, typically referencing local places of worship. Cultic objects like altars and incense burners are frequently inscribed and/or adorned with symbols and monograms relating to the gods.
By the end of the 1st millennium BCE, Maʿīn had lost control of some territories in the Jawf to Sabaʾ and other tribes, such as the ʾAmīr from Najrān. In the cities of Nashshān and Haram, inscriptions were no longer in Minaic but in Sabaic. Furthermore, instead of invoking the gods of the Minaean pantheon, old local deities were invoked alongside Sabaean gods or the gods of the newcomers. The last datable mentions of Minaean kings, and consequently the last datable Minaic texts, date back to the mid-1st century CE, marking the eventual disappearance of the kingdom of Maʿīn – together with its religious system – from historical sources.",-800,50,2410,1609,Irene Rossi,50,Andrew Danielson,2024-04-11 20:44:24.476 +0200,2024-06-01 07:35:45.300 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.2245991759122704,0.23994974622606433,0.25382516177419884,0.1616222796151267,0.10242956967251968,0.017574066799820015
2335,The Seventh-day Adventist Church in Nigeria,43,Religious Group (v6),"THE SEVENTH DAY ADVENTIST CHURCH IN NIGERIA
Seventh-day Adventist (SDA) Church is a Sabbath Keeper and Protestant Christian denomination. made its entry into Nigeria in the year 1914 through efforts spearheaded by Elder David Caldwell Babcock who was born in New Hampshire, Ohio in United States of America on September 12, 1854. He arrived Nigeria with his family and missionaries: Dauphin, a Ghanaian and S. Morgues, a Sierra Leonean on March 7, 1914. Before his exit in 1918 as a result of ill health. Babcock had established three major branches in Erunmu (Oyo State), Shao (Kwara State) and Ipoti (Ekiti State).  It was from these branches that the present branches were organised. The Church is largely represented in the South West, South East and North East Nigeria. In a 2018 census conducted by the church, it reported having 234,200 members across the three Union Conferences that make up the SDA Church in the country. Presently, membership of the Church has now grown to about 278,000 members across 282 local assemblies in the country.
 From the emergence of the SDA Church in Nigeria, Special attentions were paid to the establishments of elementary schools where people could learn how to read and write. It was a priority for the Church to establish training centres where early Church workers were trained.  Shao became the first training ground for both Pastors and teachers. Additionally, this centre offered vocational skills, such as carpentry, bricklaying, woodwork and painting. As more souls were to the Church, new branches were opened and more schools. Presently, the Church has two universities (Babcock and Clifford), and many secondary and primary schools in Nigeria. 
As the Church kept on evangelising, it was planning to establish medical centres where people could get medical treatment. The structures, drugs and personnel were put in place to better the well being of the people. Statically, three medical centres were opened in Jengre (Northern Nigeria), Aba (Eastern Nigeria) and Ile-Ife (Western Nigeria). These were insufficient, hence, the need for more medical centres in Nigeria. The Church then opened more medical centres. Presently are many medical centres of which Babcock University Teaching is exceptionally impacting the whole Nigeria.  
The Church holds 28 fundamental beliefs that can be organised into six categories. These are: the doctrine of God, doctrines of man, salvation, church, Christian life and last day events. For a smooth administration in Nigeria, the Church this organigram. That is, Local Church, District, Conference and Union administrative offices. While local church oversees the running of the Church at the local level, the district coordinates the activities of the local churches within the same district. It is in the same manner that the conference superverses the works being carried out in the districts of the same jurisdiction.  Presently, in Nigeria the has three unions (Northern Nigerian Union-Abuja, Eastern Nigerian Union-Aba and Western Nigerian Union-Lagos) these control all the activities of the conferences under their territory.

2339,Yorùbá Traditional Religion,43,Religious Group (v6),"Yorùbá Traditional Religion
The Yorùbá are a distinct ethnic group found across a few countries of west Africa. They òconsider Ilé-Ifẹ as their ancestral home from where they migrated to all locations where they are currently found. They occupy the entire southwest Nigeria and are found in groups in Nigeria’s north central staters of Kwara and Kogi as well as in the South-south region of Edo and Delta. The Yorùbá people are also found in places like Ghana, Benin Republic and Togo. The people have a rich cultural heritage which includes their religion. Scholars, while dissecting their religious practises have suggested several terminologies to describe their religious eco-system. Their indigenous religious structure has been described as polytheism, Poly-monotheism and diffused monotheism to mention a few. Their indigenous religious architecture has attracted such robust appraisal and reappraisal owing to its uniqueness, colour, glamour and the ingenuity of the people regarding their faith life.
The Yorùbá have Olódúmarè at the apex of their religion. He is assisted in administering the universe by his retinue of deities (òrìsà). The òrìsà are of two classes. The first are the primordial deities and the second, deified gods/ancestors. Primordial deities among the Yorùbá include Ọbàtálá or Ọrúnmílà, Èsù while deified gods include Sàngó and Oya. Below the òrìsà are the personification of natural forces. The spirits/ghosts/apparitions and other phenomena are classified next to the natural forces. There is another class of beings (previously humans) who are looked upon as having attained some degree of awe, worship and reference. They are the ancestors who lived a good life and have transited the earthly realm to the realm beyond. 
Olódúmarè is conceived as the almighty, the controller of the universe and the force behind order and symphony in the world. He is however held as being too busy with other issues beyond the daily running of the universe and has therefore placed the administration of the earth in the care of the numerous òrìsà who have their areas of specialization while intervening in human affairs. They òrìsà are consulted by humans whenever they seek solutions to issues that confront them. Some of the òrìsà are reputed as fertility gods/goddesses, others are consulted for vengeance on enemies, while some still are reputed for their strength in wars, battles and difficult challenges. Both the primordial deities and deified gods attend to the numerous challenges brought to them by members of the human community. The difference between the two classes of deities has become very blur such that many times, the deified gods are sometimes spoken of and treated as primordial deities.
 In the past, the Yorùbá depended on natural forces for protection. They relied on hills, mountains, rivers and forests/caves as defence against enemies. Many Yorùbá villages and communities soon began to venerate such natural forces either as fertility gods/goddesses or as their protectors. Olósùnta rock (Ikere Ekiti), Ọșun river (Osogbo) Oke Ibadan (Ibadan) are good examples of personification of natural forces in Yorubaland. Some of the deities are also reputed to deploy natural forces like thunder, whirlwind, and storms (eg. Sàngó) in the defence of their votaries. Besides the natural forces, the Yorùbá also belief in Spirits, apparitions and ghosts. They recognise spirits that inhabit forests, trees and other natural elements. Ancestors are the closest of the non-human/divine beings which the Yorùbá people recognise. They are believed to be around and always present within the human community they once lived in. They are moral agents who listen to every conversation, pay attention to the strict observance of taboos and every other aspect of the lives of the people. They could reward and punish for good and bad conducts. 
Aside those in their ancestral homes, Africans in the diaspora also exported their religions in their sojourns and have continued to identify with their deities and other traditional practices for several centuries. For examples, in places like Trinidad and Tobago, Brazil, Cuba, Portugal among others, Africans and in this case, the Yorùbá have continued to showcase their religion and culture in territories and nations where they are found. The Yorùbá indigenous religion is indeed complex but exciting. Unlike some world religions, they are not prone to religious extremism which breeds violence and intolerance. Rather, each religious group observes their festivals, ceremonies and worship without the fear of violence from other groups. Religious syncretism is at its peak among the people. Votaries of one religious group accompany their friends and relations to worship their deities and they reciprocate this gesture to one another during their religious observances. 
The religious festivals of the people are usually colourful, lively and full of symbols. They begin their traditional year, planting seasons, harvest times and indeed all their significant occasions with prayers and venerations to their gods and goddesses who are believed to be intermediaries between Olódúmarè and human beings. The gods/goddesses know their boundaries and do not ascribe to themselves the honour that is due to the supreme being. Rather, they are said to receive the sacrifice from the human community and present them to Olódúmarè for His attention and approval.",1100,2024,2414,1526,Oyeyemi Oyekan,57,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,2024-04-15 09:56:22.735 +0200,2024-04-30 22:47:03.321 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.9882689763587366,0.0020338932845657205,1.8861859509721387e-22,8.965495688570365e-13,0.009697130355801048,4.982506148774262e-19
2345,Contemporary Shingon,43,Religious Group (v6),"This entry is primarily restricted to the priestly class of those identifying within the Shingon tradition. Shingon is one of two major schools of Buddhism identifying as Mikkyō, a Japanese Vajrayana Buddhist tradition often translated as Esoteric Buddhism. In contemporary Japan, there is relatively little crossover between schools among the priests themselves. But laity are far more likely to participate with multiple branches; even if registered as members of a particular temple, the bond is not usually strong. Shingon itself has several sub-schools, but many of the general practices and training are similar enough to fit within the same category.
The Shingon tradition in Japan has roughly 1200 years of history and numerous branches and sub-branches that developed over the years, each with variations on a complex corpus of ritual practices and interpretations of key doctrinal points.
Kūkai (774- 835) travelled to China in 804 and besides his religious training, brought back 216 scriptural texts new to Japan, 42 in Sanskrit. Kūkai also brought instructional Sanskrit texts to teach others this language previously unknown in Japan, along with mandalas, vajras, and many other items critical to implementing most of the new “ritual technology” of Esoteric Buddhism. With patience, Kūkai not only returned to the capital, but gained the deep respect of both the imperial court and the leading priests of the time. Although it is hard to say he “founded” Shingon from a historical perspective since he did not clearly intend to begin a fully separate school of Buddhism, he is generally regarded as the founder by its modern priests and adherents. 
Kakuban (1095-1143) became recognized for both his writings and the power of his practice. Although Kakuban eventually gained leadership of Koyasan, other priests forced him and his students out in late 1140 or early 1141. His teachings led to a new sub-sect, known as Shingi-Shingon, which includes major sub-schools Chizan-ha and Buzan-ha. 
Much of Shingon practiced is based around the “three mysteries” of body, speech, and mind; these are meant to be purified, respectively, through the use of mudra, mantra, and visualization. Priesthood has many different levels, primarily marked by abhiṣeka (empowerments). Generally, the main steps include (a) tokudō, through which one takes a few initial precepts and becomes a novice priest, (b) jukai, a much larger and more ritualized 3-fold set of precepts, and (c) shido-kegyō, a four-fold training made up of an 18-fold practice, womb world mandala (taizōkai) practice, vajra world mandala (kongōkai) practice, and goma (Skt., homa, a form of fire ritual). Completion of these is at some point followed by a denbō abhiṣeka and the rank of acharya. Beyond this, there are many forms of training and other abhiṣeka possible which might either raise one’s priestly rank or teach other rituals for specific purposes (i.e. healing of a particular form of disease or banishing a type of negative spiritual presence).
Contemporary Shingon is not restricted to Japan’s borders. There is a small presence in places like the United States (especially Hawai’i), Brazil, and some parts of Europe. There is also a growing presence in Taiwan and some parts of Southeast Asia. However, the vast majority of Shingon priests and adherents are still within Japan and so the answers here are provided from that perspective.",1950,2024,86,1622,Nathan Jishin Michon,47,Kaitlyn Ugoretz,2024-04-21 06:36:09.056 +0200,2024-04-22 18:21:42.796 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.8712047258023232,0.00014126933487414848,1.6267834700919586e-33,2.5470081496542865e-11,0.12865400483733253,2.7218632464498313e-28

2348,Ancient Israelite Religion (Iron Age),43,Religious Group (v6),"The ancient Israelite religion(s) of the Iron Age, spanning the 12th through 6th centuries BCE, represents a significant period of religious development, most importantly for producing the text of the Hebrew Bible and culminating in the formation of what would later become Judaism and Christianity. In his monumental treatment of ancient Israelite religion through the lens of divinity, Lewis (2020: 2-8) outlines a lengthy list of topics that encompasses its study, including, inter alia, the study of divinity (e.g. pantheons, individual deities, divine councils and assemblies), sacred time and space (e.g.  religious calendars, sacred architecture), cultic paraphernalia (e.g. apotropaic objects, symbols), religious praxis (e.g. rituals, religious festivals, dietary regulations, the organizing principles of cult, etc.), religious personnel (kings, priests, prophets, and other religious actors), the reflective side of religion (e.g. theology, wisdom literature), and its various aesthetic presentations (literature, music, art, and dance). Studying ancient Israelite religion is an interdisciplinary enterprise that must be approached from various scholarly perspectives, each of which offer unique insights into the beliefs and practices of the Israelites and Judeans of the Iron Age Southern Levant. These disciplines include the historical-critical analysis of the Hebrew Bible, archaeology, art history, sociology, anthropology, comparative religious studies, philology and literary analysis, and various other interdisciplinary approaches that shed light on the origins, iconography, characterization, and worship of the ancient Israel’s deities such as El, Yahweh, Asherah, and Baal (Niditch 1997; Hess 2007; Lewis 2020). Although a critical reading of the Hebrew Bible has long been the main source of information for understanding both traditional and non-traditional expressions of Yahwism, new information gleaned from archaeological excavations is gradually becoming a major player in the reconstruction of the diversity of ancient Israelite religious practices (Faust 2020). Utilizing a multifaceted methodological approach, scholars can dissect the intricate layers of ancient Israelite religion, shedding light on fundamental distinctions between official/national/state religion centered around institutionalized practices and cultic institutions like the Jerusalem temple, and family/domestic/daily religion comprising household devotion to local gods and familial traditions such as ancestor veneration and the rites of the cults of the dead (Lewis 1989). For example, one particularly fruitful case study of religious development in the history of ancient Israel from its Canaanite ancestry to its Jewish progeny is the origins and development of biblical monotheism (Albright 1940; Smith 2001) in the context of its polytheistic milieu (Cross 1973; Van Der Toorn, Becking, and Van Der Horst 1999).",-1200,-500,2424,1379,Matthew Saunders,50,Andrew Danielson,2024-04-22 05:45:45.188 +0200,2024-04-23 06:08:29.264 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.4341571316065402,0.4538439316191122,2.3721186226385087e-11,0.0870843581531476,0.02490459696739972,9.981630079024535e-06
2349,Methodism (Wesleyanism),43,Religious Group (v6),"Methodism, or Wesleyanism, as it is contemporarily understood, is a system of Christian theology originally taught by the Anglican cleric, John Wesley (1703-1791). Wesleyanism centrally supports Jesus Christ's Two Greatest Commandments that He taught during His ministry: all believers must love God with all their heart, mind, soul and strength, and each is to love one's neighbour as oneself (Matthew 22:36-40). John Wesley's ideas are firmly rooted in Biblical scripture and Christ's teachings throughout the four Gospels. As such, Wesleyanism still upholds the tenets first articulated by Wesley, such as the centrality of moral responsibility, experiential religion, and fostering proactive evangelistic practices to reach the unchurched and disadvantaged. Originating in the early-mid eighteenth-century, John, with his brother Charles, spearheaded the Methodist movement, which was purposed to bring spiritual revival within the Church of England. The Wesleys spiritual leanings were awakened in part by John's experiences aboard a turbulent voyage to the colony of Georgia in January 1736. During a perilous storm, Wesley witnessed the unexplainable peace of a group of Moravian missionaries, who, instead of being fearful of the elements, appeared seemingly unbothered. Wesley was deeply moved by the remarkable composure of the Moravians, which he credited to their profound faith in God, and later joined a religious society comprised of Moravian Christians in London to learn more about their spirituality. In May 1738, Wesley experienced what he came to call his conversion experience to evangelicalism, where he felt his ""heart warmed"" by the Holy Spirit, and began his own ministry. Wesley did not intend to establish a new church but originally sought reform within the Church of England due to its systemic duplicity (much like Martin Luther's efforts to incite reform within the Roman Catholic Church during the early sixteenth century). Nevertheless, as Wesley's teachings disseminated, there was a steady awakening of ""societies"" which grew into the Methodist movement. The earliest Methodist ""church"" was arguably established in London near the end of 1739. About a dozen individuals deeply convicted of their sins and eagerly looking for redemption sought Wesley there. Together, Wesley spent time with them in prayer and advised the group on how to escape the coming wrath of the age. They met together weekly (usually on Thursday evenings) and many more soon after desired to join their meetings. Wesley wrote ""The Guides and Helps to Holy Living"" for his followers; not as a replacement to the Bible but as a supplemental guide on holy living. Wesley widely traveled across Great Britain and preached outdoors to large crowds. He helped form and organize Christian societies that rallied around personal moral accountability, religious instruction, and discipleship. These Christians became known as Methodists for their distinct ""methodical"" ways of practicing the faith and their mutual accountability of holding each other to the ""Way."" Under Wesley’s leadership, Methodists became leaders in many social issues of the day, such as prison reform and the abolition of slavery and the transatlantic slave trade. Wesley’s teachings were collectively known as Wesleyan theology or Methodism, which informed the practices of Methodist societies across the British Empire. One of Wesley’s most compelling ideas was how by faith a believer was transformed into the likeness of Christ, and could subsequently achieve a state where the love of God reigned in their heart. This gave them an inward rather than an outward holiness. Methodism strove to cultivate a spiritual community among members that concentrated on the soul and not the physical body; a truly radical philosophy at the height of the transatlantic slave trade. As such, Methodists attracted many Black converts such as Olaudah Equiano, a notable Black late eighteenth century seafarer, author, and former slave. The movement spread to North America through the emigration of Methodists, who, in the 1760s, began to organize the Methodist ""classes"" and ""societies"" in the colonies. In December 1784 at the Christmas Conference in Baltimore, Maryland, the Methodist Episcopal Church was formally organized. The new church experienced a surge of members and quickly became one of the leading religious forces among the Protestant denominations in the new United States of America. Although John Wesley and the earliest Methodist leaders in America were staunchly against human slavery, the invention of the cotton gin and the economic advantages to slavery in the late eighteenth century led many Methodist ministers and members to become slaveholders. Abhorred by the slaveholding practices in the church, a group of ministers, led by Orange Scott, began to agitate for a new abolition of slavery within the Methodist church. With bishops and other members of the church seeking to silence these outspoken ministers in order to preserve the status quo within their congregations, a series of ministerial and church withdrawals from the Methodist Episcopal Church began in the early 1840s. Methodists who were staunchly opposed to slavery organized a convention at Utica, New York in May-June 1843 where they established a new name for their church: the Wesleyan Methodist Connection of America. This ""connection"" was an organization of local churches that avoided episcopacy and provided for equal ministerial and lay representation in all of its governing bodies. This reformed ""Wesleyan"" Methodism of sorts emphasized moral and social reform, evangelism, and prohibited the consumption of intoxicating liquors and all practices of slaveholding. Today, churches that identify as ""Wesleyan"" are still denominationally Protestant and retain an orthodoxy (and orthopraxy) reflective of the reformed teachings, values, and practices of earlier traditions.",1738,2024,2426,1560,Bethany Henderson,1,M.

2365,Moriscos,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Moriscos were a distinct people of Hispano-Muslim identity who had accepted Christian baptism within the Iberian Peninsula during the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. They were the descendants of Spanish Muslims who converted to Christianity under duress in 1502 following the surrender of the last remaining Islamic state in Iberia in 1492, the Kingdom of Grenada. Due to ongoing unrest by madejares in the years following the conquest of Grenada, King Ferdinand and Queen Isabel revoked a treaty that protected the religious freedoms of Muslims in return for their political loyalty. Ferdinand and Isabel's union signalled a new epoch, as the union of Castile and Aragon facilitated a broader movement towards national and religious unification for the Spanish kingdoms. A mandate was subsequently issued that ordered all Castilian Muslims to either depart the kingdom or accept baptism. This strategy of assimilating Muslims into a homogenized Spanish Christian society spread to the Kingdoms of Navarre and Valencia in 1515 and then to Aragon during the 1520s. Ferdinand's edict led to the baptism of hundreds of thousands of madejares or ""nuevos conversos de moros"" (new Moorish converts). While the Church expected the sacramental efficacy of baptism to transform the hearts of Moriscos, many continued to practice Islam as secret (or crypto) Muslims. After the expulsion of dissident Muslims in 1502, many Moriscos transformed their homes into spaces of resistance where families spoke the prohibited Arabic language, uttered prayers, acknowledged holy days and fasts, circumcised their male infants, maintained dietary restrictions, wore traditional costumes, and participated in ritual washing. The Muslim principle of ""taqiyya"" (often translated as ""dissimulation"" or ""precaution"") granted Muslims whose lives or livelihoods were threatened the ability to conform to Christianity outwardly while inwardly adhering to their true Islamic convictions. Moriscos could assume a nominal Christianized public-image in order to receive certain political privileges, but maintain a clandestine domestic devotion to Islam. However, others that demonstrated a sincerity towards Christianity were nevertheless treated with suspicion by Old Christians due to the perceived ambiguity between Islamic devotion and mere cultural tradition. As the sixteenth century wore on, Muslim cultural differences were interpreted by the Spanish Inquisition and Old Christians as Morisco deviance, which was inextricably linked with apostasy. Old Christians harboured a distinct racial discrimination towards Moriscos, believing them to be deceptive and dishonest. Old Christians asserted that their families did not descend from Jewish or Muslim ancestry but had ""pure"" Christian bloodlines (""limpieza de sangre"" or ""of purity of blood""). They consequently treated Morisco cultural activities as dubious and incompatible with Spanish Christianity despite many converts having abandoned their customs by adapting to Old Christian practices after baptism. Throughout the century, strict new laws were placed on Moriscos to strip them of lingering practices that linked them to an Islamic past. Spain's war against Morisco autonomy led to periodic bursts of conflict throughout the sixteenth century, such as the second Rebellion of the Alpujarras (1568-1571). The New Christians were pigeonholed by the implications of Spain's mandates which naturally elicited unrest due to its racialized legislation. The insistence of religious and secular authorities pressured Moriscos to conform to Christianity and abandon Islam, but Old Christian fears and doubts made integration into Spanish society impossible. For Spain, Moriscos threatened the religious stability of the kingdom which in turn jeopardized the Crown's sovereignty. By the seventeenth century, after a century of contention between Old Christians and Moriscos, King Philip III ordered the expulsion of all Moriscos from Spain in 1609: his solution to the ongoing ""Morisco problem."" The Moriscos of Valencia were the first to be expelled, where the population was densest and the threat of an alliance with an Islamic power in the Mediterranean was greatest. Over the next five years, this decree was implemented systematically throughout the rest of Spain until the expulsion was considered complete and pronounced a ""success"" in 1614. It is estimated that approximately 300,000 Moriscos were expelled from Spain between 1609 and 1614. Several thousand Moriscos avoided expulsion by either assimilating into virtual invisibility among Old Christian culture (e.g. marrying Old Christians) or receiving exceptional dispensations by the Crown. Although expelled Moriscos could live openly as Muslims in their places of resettlement along the Barbary Coast within the Ottoman Empire, their unique experiences in Spain consequently gave rise to complex issues of identity that were tenuous, ambiguous, and fractured.",1502,1614,2452,1560,Bethany Henderson,1,M.

2366,Islam in Hausaland,43,Religious Group (v6),"Defining the Hausaland is somewhat quagmiry. This is because some scholars give its definition based on the land where people’s mother tongue is Hausa language. Meanwhile, the land covers in the main a large area of northern Nigeria and part of the present-day Republic of Niger. The territory of the Hausa states lay above the confluence of the Niger and Benue rivers (in present-day northern Nigeria), between the Songhai empire in the west and that of the Kanem-Bornu, or Bornu, in the east. The seven true Hausa states, or Hausa Bakwai (Biram, Daura, Gobir, Kano, Katsina, Rano, and Zaria (Zazzau), and their seven outlying satellites, or Banza Bakwai (Zamfara, Kebbi, Yauri, Gwari, Nupe, Kororofa (Jukun), and Yoruba), had no central authority, were never combined in wars of conquest, and were therefore frequently subject to domination from outside.
The historians had spoken with one voice regarding the origin of the Hausaland. They opined that the original seven kingdoms of the Hausaland were traceable to a Muslim Arab man called Abu Zayd or Hawdhah. The latter left his native land (Baghdad) to this part of Nigeria in the late 8th century. He then rambled the land till he arrived at the place called Daura. Thereafter, his grandchildren later became the seven Hausa rulers of Daura, Kano, Katsina, Zakzaki, Zamfara, Rano and Buram. It is believed that this Muslim Arab man tended to be a survival of the Umayyad people displaced as a result of the Abbasid people that had toppled their dynasty. Thus, this man might have been responsible for the introduction of Islam in the society, and the nature of the idolaters who used to revert to their former faith might have made Islam to later become a thing of the past in the society.
As far as the advent of Islam in Hausaland, scores of scholarly historians have written at great length on the topic. According to the Kano Chronicle, a Muslim community had been found in Kano by the middle of the 14th century. The introduction of Islam into the society is said to have been traceable to some missionaries who hailed from Mali. In another historical account on the advent of Islam in Hausaland, Katsina, which is regarded as the seat of civilization and culture, some of its indigenes are said to have been the pioneer Muslims. This is because the city is topographically situated the route of the traversing caravans from Timbuktu to Borno and Egypt. And there was a big market there that the Barbarians, Wangara and the Arabs used to patronize in the middle of the 12th century.  The precise date of the advent of Islam in Katsina is unknown; but the inhabitants of this region had been in contact with Islam since time immemorial. Meanwhile, the spread of Islam to Kano in the 13th century is believed to have been precipitated by the influx of the Wangara to place.
Muhammad Ibn Abd al-Karim al-Maghili, a Berber Islamic scholar, in the course of touring North and West Africa also arrived in Kano in 1492 while on a journey that took him to Mecca as well as Air, Gao and Katsina among other places. In the course of his stopover at Kano, he organized and saw to the religious needs of the North Africa community there. Besides, it was chronicled that he handwrote a Qur᾿ãn for the people of Kano, for he had not brought a copy with him, and had to teach the Qur᾿ãn and the punishment of the law. The visitation of al-Maghili to Kano took place in the second half of the 15th century during Muhammad Rumfa’s regime (1463-1499), and that had enhanced the stability of Islam and the spread of the Islamic guidelines in this part of the world. This writing is concerned about the Hausa people, their belief system, how Islam was brought into being in Hausa-land, and its impact on the lives of the people there. It deals with the ancient cities like Kano, Katsina, Zaria, Daura, Kebbi and so on, which are situated in the present day northern Nigeria.",1500,2024,2453,1569,Abdul mumin Alawiye,55,Julian Weideman,2024-04-29 18:02:18.348 +0200,2024-05-05 11:48:07.335 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.9849310711608473,0.002461093739297167,2.67244507374344e-12,9.37449124531041e-11,0.012607835003438069,2.202417646498823e-29

2371,Tewa Pueblo Religion,43,Religious Group (v6),"This entry discusses religious ideas and practices of the six currently inhabited Tewa-speaking Pueblos of northern New Mexico, USA. The time span covered is roughly from the mid-20th century, when several major ethnographic works were published, to the present. Most of the details presented are based on the personal experiences of the author. At the time of this writing, Tewa religion is a syncretic assemblage of Indigenous and Spanish-introduced elements. Religious practices are largely compartmentalized into Indigenous and Catholic components, and community members are well aware of which is which. Some Spanish Catholic elements have been incorporated into Indigenous practices, and vice versa, but the two forms of practice basically co-exist side by side. Over the past century the Tewa population has grown substantially, and the dominant society has come to appreciate and support Indigenous religious and cultural practices to a much greater extent. Over the period of my own observation (1994 to 2024) there has been notable revitalization in Indigenous practice, and a decrease in Catholic practice. However, it is still typical for life-cycle rituals to involve both Indigenous and Spanish components which are performed by Tewa religious society leaders and Catholic priests, respectively.

Ancestral (archaeological) sites with traditional Tewa names are found across a much broader area of northern New Mexico often referred to as the Tewa Basin, ranging from the towns of Abiquiu, El Rito and Ojo Caliente in the north to Los alamos and White Rock in the West, Santa Fe in the south, and Cordova and Velarde in the east. Settlements in these broader areas were largely vacated during the 16th and 17th centuries as a consequence of Spanish colonialism. Most of the present-day tribal lands of the six communities into which this broader population coalesced were established through Spanish land grants in the late 17th century. The Indigenous religious components discussed in this entry, minus obvious Spanish introductions (e.g. allusions to the wheat-growing power of ancestral cloud beings), likely characterized ancestral (pre-contact) Tewa communities of these areas, although some dances (e.g., the Comanche Dance) must have originated more recently. 

Tewa oral traditions suggest the ancestors of Tewa people lived to the northwest of the Tewa Basin, and that Tewa society originated through the coming together of two distinct peoples (the winter and summer people) who migrated into the Tewa Basin from this northern homeland at different times (winter came first, and summer followed). Archaeological and bio-archaeological evidence reinforce this view and identify the northern drainages of the San Juan River in southwest Colorado, USA, as the most likely ancestral homeland. In addition, connections between etymological analyses of Tewa vocabulary and archaeological material culture suggest the Tewa language originated as a distinct language in the vicinity of what is today known as the Montezuma Valley in southwest Colorado. Taken together, the evidence suggests the Tewa language and most of the ancestral Tewa population migrated from this northern homeland into the Tewa Basin in the late 13th century. However, Tewa oral tradition and archaeological evidence suggest a significant socioreligious reformation accompanied this migration. So, while contemporary religious ideas, and some contemporary practices, originated in the northern homeland of Tewa ancestors, other contemporary practices likely originated in the Tewa Basin.",1950,2020,2458,1256,Scott Ortman,54,Diana Moreiras,2024-05-01 00:16:46.428 +0200,2024-05-16 23:13:02.364 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.17890478241535918,0.014372654723954163,3.751759063013415e-34,9.332803365930812e-14,0.7876964344874745,0.01902612837311882
