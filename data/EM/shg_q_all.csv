211,Amarna Religion,35,Religious Group (v5),"Tell el-Amarna is the modern name for the ancient city, Akhetaten. It was created by Amenhotep IV, who would later change his name to Akhenaten. This ruler emphasized the role of the god Aten, promoting the belief that this god was primary among all other gods in ancient Egypt, and presented himself as the god's one true prophet and intermediary. This meant that the other Egyptians were cut off from direct access to their gods. At this time in Egyptian history, the god Amun had become particularly prominent, and Akhenaten's workers moved through Egypt erasing the name of Amun (as well as his divine family members, Mut and Khonsu). Aten is the solar disk, and so the religion of this period, often referred to as Amarna Religion, emphasizes solar elements. Access to light and sun were central to the practice of Amarna Religion, including leaving temple spaces open. This period is a dramatic and short break from the normal state of affairs in ancient Egypt. After Akhenaten's death, traditional religion was returned to Egypt, with considerable efforts to erase any references to Akhenaten, or, ""that fallen foe from Amarna"". The city of Akhetaten was abandoned, which has left it well preserved for modern excavators. In modern periods, Amarna Religion has often been seen as the earliest monotheistic religion, though this is an oversimplification of at least religious practice at this time. While Akhenaten promoted the Aten as the most important god, and then the only god, there is significant evidence for the worship of other gods at this time, particularly in domestic contexts, including at Amarna. There is therefore evidence that not all Egyptians followed the ideas put forward by Akhenaten. Sigmund Freud, however, who was an avid reader of the Egyptologist James Henry Breasted, identified Amarna as the source of biblical monotheism, which is a big reason that this period is so well known by the public.",-1350,-1320,34,707,Thomas Schneider,5,Courtney Fitzsimmons,2015-04-08 18:45:44.060 +0200,2022-03-11 19:18:39.657 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),4.641796466364939e-13,5.716856590391403e-14,0.4813141748929899,4.690696495442722e-20,6.062795186976947e-12,1.696930852233801e-24,0.5186858251004259,8.528356819435262e-41,2.6314106238728674e-28

294,Xuanxue çå­¸,35,Religious Group (v5),"""Arcane learningâ [xuanxue] was the dominant discourse of the 3rd to the 6th centuries CE in China, which not only linked essential features of Daoist metaphysics with Confucian morality and political philosophy to create a new world view, but also served as the basis for how concepts of Buddhism were received and developed in China. Later, such concepts and terminology made their way, either directly or via Buddhism, into the formulation of Neo-Confucianism during the Song era (10th-13th centuries CE). Adherents of the xuanxue tradition such as Wang Bi and Guo Xiang are usually referred to in contemporary and later Chinese sources as belonging to the ""Daojia"" (""Men of Dao."" An older term for this movement, ""Neo-Daoism,"" is now considered misleading, since it suggest that xuanxue is primarily a renewal of the pre-Han thought of the Laozi aand Zhuangzi and fails to account for the amalgamation of that tradition of thought with many tenets of Confucianism. Xuanxue thinkers also belong more to the ""philosophical Daoism"" camp than to the ""religious Daoism"" tradition, though distinctions between the two are often ambigious and much interaction was occurring during the age of xuanxue dominance in intellectual and spiritual life. Moreover, major thinkers such as Wang Bi and Guo Xiang seem never to have engaged in such Daoist religious activities as alchemy, hygiene, magic, religious ritual, or any quest for ""transcendence"" or ""immortality"" (xian). Instead, xuanxue thinkers might also be called ""Dao scholastics"" and their tradition of thought as ""School of the Dao."" Xuanxue thinkers varied significantly in their beliefs, and the most important distinction is exemplified by how Wang Bi and Guo Xiang thought of the Dao. Whereas both regarded the Dao as a kind of blueprint or program for the generation, properties and behavior of everything, Wang Bi thought that the Dao was both transcendent to and imminent in things, Guo Xiang rejected this completely and insisted that the Dao was only immanent and had no existence apart from things. Guo was thus a materialist-monist at complete odds with Wang, who believed that the Dao was transcendent both chronologically to the existence of things at the beginning of time and also transcendent in the sense that it had a non-material existence, existing everywhere both transcendent to and imminent in all things.",200,600,574,230,Richard Lynn,51,Michael Naparstek,2016-01-24 07:00:00.000 +0100,2022-04-05 23:29:29.949 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),4.690642506436936e-28,4.475759535092613e-34,0.9523227130098694,4.7862027691459175e-14,9.138483206553086e-14,2.67145987507375e-47,2.4293154382602316e-05,6.027402345248069e-35,0.047652993835608795

358,16th-17th c. Gauá¸Ä«ya Vaiá¹£á¹ava Tradition,35,Religious Group (v5),"The Gauá¸Ä«ya Vaiá¹£á¹ava tradition is a Hindu devotional tradition that originated in the Bengal region of India during the 16th century. The 16th-17th centuries were a particularly theologically formative and constructive time for this group. Most traditions considered ""Hindu"" view the collection of texts referred to as the Åruti, or âthat which is heard,â which includes the Vedic Saá¹hitÄs and Upaniá¹£ads as the most authoritative sacred texts. Among these, many, including the early Gauá¸Ä«ya Vaiá¹£á¹ava theologians, attribute more authority to various texts belonging to the genre of smá¹ti, or âthat which is remembered.â Among these texts, there is no more authoritative than the BhÄgavata PurÄna.


Using the BhÄgavata PurÄna as the basis for their theology, early Gauá¸Ä«ya Vaiá¹£á¹ava theologians drew on a range of existing texts and traditions and used various hermeneutical strategies to develop and advocate for a path of devotion (bhakti-mÄrga) to Ká¹á¹£á¹a, the exclusive and supreme object of devotion (bhakti). They argue this path is superior to all other soteriological paths and the best means for realizing oneâs true eternal nature (svarÅ«pa), attaining the highest level of transcendental pleasure (Änanda), and achieving liberation from the cycle of birth and death (sÄá¹sÄra). 

The starting point of the path of devotion is ÅraddhÄ, or âfaith;â the overarching goal of following the path is to attain premÄ, or âdivine loveâ for Ká¹á¹£á¹a; and the principal means of attaining premÄ consists of faithfully engaging in sÄdhana, a range of diverse regulated religious practices that systematically engage the mind and body in devotional acts. In the course and consequence of attaining the goal of premÄ, early Gauá¸Ä«ya theologians reference and describe occurrences of devotees having what they refer to as a âdirect perceptual experienceâ (sÄká¹£ÄtkÄra) of Ká¹á¹£á¹a relative to the devoteeâs qualifications and devotional temperament.",1500,1699,620,343,Travis Chilcott,24,Travis Chilcott,2016-09-08 07:00:00.000 +0200,2024-06-11 13:16:37.320 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.9994743181944807,5.081740849608235e-13,1.3970452719748486e-16,7.99907136451167e-05,4.2305655236906895e-16,0.00044569106436250584,1.8202055612086845e-13,2.6820818930269555e-11,2.1777081727380084e-32

A contested episcopal election of 311, in which the Donatists and the Catholics each elected their own bishop, led to the Donatists appealing to Constantine in 313 to determine the rightful bishop. Constantine sided against the Donatists. From 317-321, he ordered their suppression using measures akin to those of the persecuting emperors: confiscating property, exile, and death. A brief but violent revival of the persecution occurred in 347-348 under his son, Constans. The emperor Julian (361-363) supported Donatism and brought Donatist bishops back from exile as part of a broader program to undermine Catholic Christianity. 

Augustine of Hippo often wrote against them, and the Council of Carthage in 411 also condemned them. Nevertheless, Donatists made up the majority of North African Christians from the fourth to fifth centuries.

472,Karma Kagyu or Kamtsang Kagyu,35,Religious Group (v5),"Karma Kagyu (Tib: karma bka' brgyud) is one of the major lineages of the Kagyud school of Tibetan Buddhism. Dusum Khyenpa (dus gsum mkhyen pa) or the 1st Karmapa (1110-1193) founded the lineage in the 12th century in Tibet by nurturing thousands of students and building three major monasteries as his main seats. In the Tibetan spiritual history, he was known as the first reincarnated lama (Tibetan sprul sku: Taking rebirth consciously and on purpose) of Tibet. After receiving profound meditation instructions from Gampopa (1079-1153), his principal teacher, he meditated over sixteen years on the snowy mountains of Kampo Gangra and Tsurphu and conquered his inner channels and breathe, which means he found a survival skill without depending on the outer world. His fame and teachings soon spread all over Tibet, thus, many students, i.e. scholars, Yogis, merchants, and farmers, gathered together around him for seeking his teachings. 

Teachings of the lineage mainly focused on a particular method of unifying Mahamudra meditation with Six Yogas of Naropa. Besides that the school practices vast and various sutra and tantra teachings within both monastic and lay audiences. Because of the group identity, monasteries, and the selected teaching transmissions, etc, the lineage was transformed into a systematic school after the Karmapa's death. The lineage has continued for around nine hundred years within the Asian countries. Recently, after 1959, led by the 16th Karmapa Rangjung Rigpe Dorje (1924-1981), the glory of Karma Kagyu reached an international audience. As a result, in the 21st century, this lineage becomes one of the largest and charismatic Tibetan Buddhist organizations in the world led by two young and talented 17th Karmapas, Ugyen Trinley and Thaye Dorje. Under their leadership, the religious organization has thousands of monasteries, nunneries, monastic institutes, and lay Buddhist Centres around the globe. 

Lastly, although being an expert in this lineage both academically and empirically, I admit that many answers here are not absolute but variable of time, place, and people. Also, I found that many questions asked here are anthropological and social science-based inquiries, in which the lineage may or may not necessarily have the answers. However, I answered them to complete the data such as the Karma Kagyu population number but keep open to change in the future as one finds scientific proof.",1110,2017,96,490,Mriti Gyana,40,Stephen Christopher,2017-11-03 00:11:02.947 +0100,2020-08-06 23:45:42.732 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.9994743181944807,5.081740849608235e-13,1.3970452719748486e-16,7.99907136451167e-05,4.2305655236906895e-16,0.00044569106436250584,1.8202055612086845e-13,2.6820818930269555e-11,2.1777081727380084e-32

534,Roman Imperial Cult,35,Religious Group (v5),"The Imperial Cult honored Roman emperors during lifetime and after death, both in Rome and in the provinces. The first emperor to receive an official deification was Augustus in 14 CE, although the deification of Julius Caesar, and the establishment of his cult after his assassination in 44 BCE, can be seen as a precursor. Although involving the traditional material and ritual culture of Roman religionsâtemples, altars, sacrifices, festivals, priesthoodsâthe cult was not strictly defined, and substantial variations existed across geographic regions and time periods. The spread of the cult throughout newly acquired territories was an important vehicle for the establishment of Roman imperial authority. For the local elites in provincial cities, the imperial cult offered opportunities to simultaneously express affiliation to Roman values, while promoting individual power agendas. Because the Imperial Cult functioned within the boundaries of traditional Roman religious practice, the answers to many of the questions in this entry broadly apply and make reference to Roman religions as a system.",-42,518,132,453,Gretel RodrÃ­guez,41,Gretel RodrÃ­guez,2018-04-04 16:13:08.969 +0200,2018-12-11 22:34:53.502 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.10471367831314499,0.10232329518074389,6.090501582707857e-16,0.0024500554396601143,3.575891767964521e-15,0.0009351740184971211,0.7895777967723565,2.7559311645321783e-10,8.538842573906299e-21

562,Medieval ÅrÄ«vaisÌ£á¹avism,43,Religious Group (v6),"ÅrÄ«vaisÌ£á¹avism is a Hindu sect that worships VisÌ£á¹u along with his consort ÅrÄ«, the main leader of which is RÄmÄnuja (traditional dates: 1017: 1137), a proponent of visÌisÌ£taÌdvaita (âqualified non-dualismâ). This tradition is based on ubhaya-vedÄnta, i.e. both the Sanskrit and the Tamil scriptures. The latter consists essentially of the poetry of the Äá¸»vÄrs (Tamil bhakti poets [6th-9th centuries]), collectively known as the NÄlÄyira Tivviya Pirapantam (or NÄlÄyira Divya Prabandham), especially NammÄá¸»vÄrâs TiruvÄymoá¸»i, which is referred to as the drÄvidÌ£a-veda (âTamil Vedasâ) or dramidÌ£opanisÌ£ad (âTamil UpanisÌ£adâ). Therefore, this sect, while not limited to Southern India, is much more present in that region than elsewhere. Around the 13th-15th centuries, differences of opinions began to rise with its important ÄcÄryas (e.g. PilÌ£lÌ£ai LokaÌcaÌrya [traditional dates: 1264-1327], VedaÌnta DesÌika [traditional dates: 1268-1369] and ManÌ£avaÌlÌ£a MaÌmuni [traditional dates: 1370-1445]) interpreting the scriptures differently on a few theological issues. This schism became cristallised a couple of centuries later (around the 18th-19th centuries), leading to the formation of two schools, the Northern (vatÌ£akalai) and the Southern (tenÌ±kalai) ones. The former follows in the path shown by VedaÌnta DesÌika.",1017,1445,480,572,Suganya Anandakichenin,24,Travis Chilcott,2018-04-27 05:48:45.744 +0200,2018-05-03 08:45:15.752 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.05352071369659027,0.25089952663823606,7.758243698234501e-15,0.03177658278111189,0.00013509252364328605,6.4658032185887505e-12,4.035582384275128e-15,0.6636680843523813,1.559450872638163e-12

564,Tribal Christianity (and allied castes) in the Himalayas,43,Religious Group (v6),"The tribal Christian population of the high Himalayas and low-lying hills spans five countries (India, Nepal, Pakistan, Bhutan and China) and contested boarderlands (Tibet, Sikkim, Aksai Chin and Kashmir, among others). It encompasses approximately 6 million people. The largest Christian tribal populations are 4.9 million converted Baptists, Presbyterians and Catholics in Northeast India and 375,000 Evangelical Protestants in Nepal (a figure sometimes rounded up to 1 million) -- arguably the fastest-growing Christian population in the world. Small but important Christian tribal communities are in Bhutan, Sikkim, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Jammu and Kashmir. The historical timeline of tribal conversion to Christianity depends on the region and date of missionary penetration into the hills. The Portuguese Jesuit JoÃ£o Cabral was arguably the first European to access the Himalayan region in 1627 with missionary designs. Since then, thousands of missionaries have come into the Himalayan region, from the London-based Church Missionary Society (Punjab region through the 20th century) to the recent explosion of South Korean missionaries populating language institutes and centered in the Kathmandu Valley. Indigenous house churches have sprouted up in remote tribal villages. Himalayan tribal Christianity falls into a broad spectrum of official affiliation. Some expressions of tribal Christianity are largely indigenous and invisible; they address local aspirations and offer respite from spiritual affliction and caste discrimination within circumscribed tribal cosmologies and social stratifications. Other expressions of tribal Christianity are hooked into international NGOs and global ideoscapes promoting salvation that are backed by foreign patronage and theological instruction; they are networked through social media platforms and employ a range of conversion techniques associated with Western (and South Korean) Evangelicalism. In some cases, tribal Christianity in the Himalayas allows discriminated-against Dalit groups who are embedded within tribal formations to find self-respect and social validation within the new idiom of salvation and equality under Yesu Masih (Jesus Christ). Although Christians are persecuted throughout South Asia, overt violence against the minority religion is not as strongly evident in the Himalayan tribal range as it is in Pakistan and non-Himalayan India states (especially Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Odisha, where in 2007-08 in Kandhamal District 50 Christians were killed and 95 churches burned down). The rise of right-wing Hindutva politics since 2014 and the disproportionate criminalization of Christian conversion as coercive have pushed Christianity further into the social margins everywhere through India, including the Himalayan tribal belt. As would be expected, Christian tribals in the Himalayas are not strongly unified around their minority religious status; divided by language, geography and often theology and sectarian affiliation, they are sometimes balkanized into subdividing communities. Nevertheless, they are conceptually and anthropologically interconnected as a Pan-Himalayan community of faith, spiritual aspiration and unique forms of theological syncretism.",1950,2018,799,576,Stephen Christopher,5,Courtney Fitzsimmons,2018-05-06 11:08:27.895 +0200,2018-06-15 18:00:32.382 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.001436389408412549,0.04349245456468567,2.4205253401043623e-15,0.09946488263213588,0.004850084416834748,0.6940968980955915,0.00022582137595037981,0.15643341393136986,5.557501699752987e-08

567,Gay and Lesbian Vaishnava Association (GALVA-108),35,Religious Group (v5),"GALVA-108 (The Gay and Lesbian Vaishnava Association) is an international nonprofit religious organization (incorporated in 2002) using hermeneutics and scriptural/historical interpretation of the Vedas and Vedic culture to argue for queer inclusivity within Gaudiya Vaishnavism and Hinduism in general. It is nonsectarian, has no official physical centers, and has been online for over 20 years. As an active community of queer Vaishnavas, GALVA-108 has about 4,000 worldwide followers and 200 currently active members. Western Europe and the West Coast of the USA are population centers. Although a cyber-organization, members are closely networked with each other and have had group meetings and shared pilgrimage not only in sacred places such as Vrindavan and Mayapura (sites associated with Lord Krishna) but also in their home countries (largely but not exclusively in North America, India and Europe). The organization was founded on May 8, 2001, by Amara Das Wilhelm, a direct disciple of A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. The founding intent was to counterbalance negative perceptions of queerness that were common within ISKCON (The International Society for Krishna Consciousness) and other Gaudiya Vaishnava groups. Amara Das published a research article about Vedic conceptions of non- normative gender and sexuality entitled âTritiya-Prakriti: People of the Third Sex.â After publication and setting up a website (currently hosted by Wix), several queer followers began joining the cyber-community and GALVA-108 quickly spread through Yahoo!, Temenos and Gaudiya Vaishnava websites such as CHAKRA, VNN and Harmonist. Ultimately, group discussion was moved to several specific Facebook pages. In 2004 the research article was published as the first chapter of a book, which has been updated periodically and an abridged version produced in 2010. Arguably the only book dedicated to queer acceptance from a Vaishnava perspective, it was preceded by several well-cited academic volumes covering similar terrain, such as Ruth Vanitaâs and Saleem Kidwaiâs 2001 âSame-Sex Love in India: Readings from Literature and History.â The group is strongly devoted to the core teachings of Lord Caitanya as enunciated by the six Goswamis and shared by all Gaudiya Vaishnavas. Like all other Gaudiyas, they advocate sharing the sankirtana movement (congregational chanting of the Lordâs holy names) with everyone through the common means of public kirtana and the distribution of literature, books and prasada (sanctified food). In another sense, GALVA-108 stands apart by arguing for the centrality of LGBTQI+ people (often collectively called the âthird genderâ) in styles of deity worship and other temple-related practices. They focus on networking GALVA-108 members with other queer and third-gender communities worldwide and are theologically concerned with instilling God consciousness to queer followers, thereby ensuring not only virtuous living but also psychosocial wellbeing. This entry is based on fieldwork with GALVA-108 members in 2007-09 in North America and India, and was completed in collaboration with Amara Dasâthe founder of GALVA-108 and its tireless public supporter.",2001,2024,802,576,Stephen Christopher,5,Courtney Fitzsimmons,2018-05-08 14:42:33.156 +0200,2024-03-08 04:38:44.673 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.9999999630194405,3.5964611908090335e-14,8.564966406660359e-16,4.7191693034051306e-11,3.693325820914318e-08,2.046488197491537e-16,7.203901793160752e-14,4.105464186489507e-16,4.171464473021844e-26
570,Supreme Master Ching Hai World Society,35,Religious Group (v5),"As Ching Hai initiates do not prefer to speak of their community as religious, it may be more precise to describe Suma Ching Hai as a transnational cybersect primarily composed of diasporic East and Southeast Asians. Suma Ching Hai is inseparable from a vast mediascape of online lectures, videos, chat groups, commercial enterprises and tightly-controlled official messaging. Sum Ching Hai is also a New Religious Movement that blends together aspects of Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity and messianic theology. The charisma of the Supreme Leader Ching Hai, called Thanh Háº£i in Vietnamese, binds the community together. She is often revered by initiates as partly divine, as a perfected being who preaches the proper meditation style (Quan Yin Method) and spreads compassion and the uplift of spiritual consciousness. Born in Vietnam, raised in the West and now based in Taiwan, Ching Hai teaches a syncretistic theology. Based on her time in India, she incorporates Sant Mat traditions, Surat Shabd Yoga (emphasizing divine sound and light), and Radhasoami as practiced in Beas. There are many similar theological touch points: 2 1/2 hours of required daily meditation; spiritual progression through stages of consciousness; abilities to experience astral planes; and total devotion on the spiritual master as an aspect of divinity. Practitioners of Ching Hai are given initiation after watching and summarizing (in written essays) 90 lectures of Ching Hai (available online) and practicing vegetarianism for at least 3 months. They are initiated by either Ching Hai herself or, more likely, by about twenty disciples who are authorized to perform initiations. Children of initiates are given ""half initiation"" at 6 and ""full initiation"" at 12 based on their spiritual advancement. Practice of Ching Hai depends on region: in Southeast Asia (Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam especially) and China, governments have branded Ching Hai as an ""evil cult"" and news stories abound about confiscations of illegal religious material or cult-like forms of psychological manipulation of initiates. In Vietnam, for example, Thanh Háº£i followers in Hanoi do so surreptitiously, with fear of government reprisal. Their meditation center is secret. Conversely, Thanh Háº£i  followers in Ho Chi Minh City are building an official meditation center and do not live under the same shroud of fearful secrecy. Besides official adherents, there are many people who practice Quan Yin Method privately and consume online material related to Ching Hai without identifying explicitly with a community or even community of faith. The global community of Ching Hai followers could be briefly summarized as bounded together by a range of theological beliefs, meditation practices and forms of digital consumption. Significant communities exist in Taiwan (called Qinghai Wushang Shijie Hui), where the main headquarters were established in 1986. Of Vietnamese origin, several thousand are practitioners and refer to Ching Hai affectionately as Chi Hai (""eldest sister"" in Vietnamese). Other concentrated populations of practitioners are in mainland China (although banned officially), South Korea, Singapore, Indonesia, Japan and California. Based on five normative precepts -- which includes not taking life and eating a vegan diet -- non-initiates of a vegan persuasion may discover this NRM by visiting one of 160 or so Loving Hut restaurants -- from Prague to Hanoi to San Jose -- where they will be exposed to Ching Hai's spiritually-infused artwork on the walls and her teachings beaming through 24 hour satellite TV. A cursory glance through online and printed media highlights the importance of veganism and these restaurants in shaping the public perception of Ching Hai (which is sometimes branded a ""Vegan Cult"" in Vice, for example).",1986,2018,806,576,Stephen Christopher,5,Courtney Fitzsimmons,2018-05-13 12:51:51.127 +0200,2018-06-09 20:42:06.672 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.000872914229963834,0.004929409204973358,0.17134905316552304,0.2567934160879668,0.004037937101462511,3.828765113663037e-24,0.013703552395607678,1.9141711435794156e-12,0.5483137178125886

589,Warrau,35,Religious Group (v5),"The Warrau inhabit the Orinoco Delta of northeastern Venezuela and traditionally lived in villages known as Rancherias, which were comprised of about five to twenty families. This entry focuses on the time of about 1930. At this point, missionaries had established contact with the Warrau, but the indigenous belief system had not been Christianized. The religious and cultural traditions of the Warrau varied regionally as a result of extreme geographic isolation, but shared a common belief in the god Jebu, the presence of their sanctuary (house of the Jebu), priests (guisidatu), prayers and offerings to Jebu, as well as religious celebrations and dances (Turrado and Muirden, 1945:302). The belief system of the Warrau is not an official or organized religion, but an aspect of life interwoven with society. Further, the Warrau did not place a strong emphasis on a belief in the afterlife, and did not possess rites, ceremonies, religious scripture or credo (Turrado and Muirden, 1945:302). As such, the Warrau religion is most accurately considered to be coterminous with society itself.

592,Veerashaivas,35,Religious Group (v5),"The Veerashaivas are devotees of Shiva, who emerged in in the 12th century, in regions that are now the modern states of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. The Veerashaiva path of devotion or bhakti was one that sought to remind its society that the mechanical performance of ritual would not help achieve 'arivu' or understanding. Arivu, led to the cessation of the cycle of birth and death. They also reminded the people around them that for moksha and for sadhana (striving towards it), all were equal, irrespective of class, caste and gender. Quite spontaneously, a number of people from different castes and communities followed this path of devotion and charted their self-transformation through a spontaneous verbalization of experience known as vachanas or simply, speech. Some describe the self-transormation in terms of six phases or Shatsthalas, which are Bhaktasthala, (2) Maheshsthala, (3) Prasadisthala, (4) Pranalingi Sthala, (5)
Sharanasthala and (6) Aiykasthala. 

Together, the Veerashaiva saints of the 12th century founded the Anubhava Mantapa, a forum for the discussion of experience, in the city of Kalyana, northern Karnataka. Anubhava literally means experience. Prominent figures of this mode of bhakti are Allama Prabhu, Basavanna, Akka Mahadevi, Soole Sankavva, Ayadakki Maramma, Devara Dasimayya and others. 

The vachanas explicate a yogic path and are essentially oral literature. The Veerashaivas are said to have emerged from earlier Shaivite sects such as the Kaalamukha and their tradition derives much from the Agamas. Many devotees of the Veerashaiva tradition took to expressing their devotion through madhura bhava (known specifically within the tradition as satipati bhava) or, love for the chosen deity and through surrender or sharanagati. The philosophy of surrender led to the Veerashaiva devotees to become known as 'shivasharanas.' For the Veerashaivas, Shiva is composed of Guru (teacher), Linga (abstract form of Shiva) and Jangama (guru with no attachments). The Veerashaivas believe in qualified monism or qualified non-dualism. 

Although the Veerashaivas expressed devotion in filial terms, their approach was largely renunciatory. They, however, did not quit society like other renunciants but instead stayed within and continued their duties. This continuation of the performance of labour but dedicating it from the beginning till end to the deity, Shiva, they considered as kayaka.",1200,2018,826,558,Sushumna Kannan,24,Travis Chilcott,2018-06-21 14:08:43.705 +0200,2020-09-25 11:55:55.410 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.9988547967697157,6.961209962129543e-21,1.0792036093496658e-14,0.0008697508250789511,2.9043744979236044e-17,2.4928281766948715e-25,3.6900408967133076e-13,0.00027545240482294863,2.552475410432481e-15

This entry focuses on the time before Christian influence (about 1825), when it was still possible for ethnographers to study the traditional religious beliefs.

Three Indian Tantric masters Åubhakarasiá¹ha (åç¡ç), Vajrabodhi (éåæº) and Amoghavajra (ä¸ç©º), brought the Esoteric Buddhist (later known in Japan as Zhenyan  çè¨, ""true word"", ""mantra"") tradition from 716 to 720 during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. Tantra/Esoteric Buddhism that has spread in Tang China and was transmitted to Japan during the same period via two famous masters Kukai (ç©ºæµ·) and Saicho (ææ¾). This tradition highly depended on mandalas, mantras, mudras, abhiá¹£ekas, and deity yoga, containing magical rituals, spells, and other elements also seen in other Indian religions. Gradually this systematic tradition died out in China after the destruction of Buddhism during the Wuzong period (846). Later during the Song, more Esoteric Buddhist texts were brought to the Song court and translated, but their influence was incomparable to Tang tantric Buddhism. However, various elements and practices still existed in Chan and Pure Land Buddhism in China until today.

645,"Meo Muslim, Mev, Mewati Muslim",43,Religious Group (v6),"The Meo, also called Mev or Mewati Muslim, self-identify as a distinct socio-cultural ethnic community, and, despite their Muslim religion, trace their lineage to the Hindu Rajputs in North India. It is also contended that the Meo converted to Islam after leaving other Hindu caste groups and a tribe, Meena, with whom they shared several similarities or that they were a nomadic Islamic tribe called the Mids, or Meds, who migrated from Western India into the region now known as Mewat, between the ninth and eleventh centuries. Today, perceived as converts from Hinduism, the Meo, numbering around 20 lakh, are considered low caste, or Neech zat, by the Indian Muslims. The Meo men and women are disfavoured for marriage by the Indian Muslims because of their suspect religious identity and their low caste status within the Muslim hierarchy.

Till recently, they have considered themselves both as a caste group and a distinct religious faith within Islam because of this dual identity. During the colonial period, they were considered a distinct caste by both Hindus and Muslims. Their customs, traditions, life cycle ceremonies and modes of prayer, till the 1990s, closely replicated the Hindus with nominal adherence to Islamic practices like circumcision, nikah or marriage ceremony, and the burial. Though lauded for their syncretic culture and religious practises that adopted and adapted traditions from both religions without succumbing to the hard-core religiosity of either, they historically faced rejection from both the faiths because of their identification as neither a âtrueâ Muslim nor Hindu. 

Historically, the Meo inhabited a geographically contiguous space called Mewat or the âland of the Meoâ, understood more as a cultural space than an administrative unit.

Since 1820, the Aymara have been under rule by the Bolivian and Peruvian Republics. Historically, the Aymara have faced pressure by dominant groups, beginning with their conquest by the Inca around 1430, and later the Spanish Conquest in the 1530âs. With the Spaniards came missionaries and the Aymara soon had contact with First Dominicans, Jesuits, Catholics, and Protestants. Spanish Catholicism was particularly influential, and has been incorporated into the Aymaraâs traditional beliefs.  Consequently, the Aymara have a variety of supernatural beings, including Christian deities (God/Christ, the Virgin, and Saints), as well as aboriginal deities (guardians, place spirits, physiographical and meteorological spirits, and demons).  Further, there are several types of religious specialists (see Tschopik, 1951:219d).

The Lakher are comprised of six groups: the Tlongsai, Hawthai, Zeuhnang, Sabeu, Lialai, and Heima. These groups are further subdivided into clans, but the village (led by a chief or bei) is the primary social, political, and religious unit. This entry focuses around the time of 1930; just six years after the Lakhers came under British rule. At this time, Lakher customs remained largely unchanged by foreign influence (British government and Christian Missionaries), and traditional religious beliefs were still held by the majority of the Lakher population. The Lakherâs supreme high god is known as Khazangpa, who is believed to have created the world and holds control over all its inhabitants. Other supernatural beings include zang (tutelary deities/guardian spirits), leurahripas (demons/evil spirits), and ancestral spirits. No official religious practitioners are present; the heads of households perform most rites and sacrifices. Mediums (zhazanghneipa) have special communication with spirits, and typically use this communication for medicinal purposes (such as finding out what sacrifices to prescribe a woman hoping to increase her fertility, for example). Ceremonies are present, and accompany most major life-cycle events. Also present is a yearly cycle of rites/feasts associated primarily with agriculture and the propitiation of supernatural beings.  Zhazangpina is the most important sacrificial rite, which is performed by the head of a household in hopes of pleasing Zhazangpa, who will in turn bless the household with good health and prosperity.

This entry focuses specifically around the time of 1963, âwhen the traditional culture of these people was still intactâ (Nimmo, 1990:4). At this time, Badjau religious beliefs were not distinguished from other aspects of life; this entry therefore considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society at large. Badjau supernatural beings include an otiose high god (Tuhan), non-human spirits (saitan), ancestral spirits (ummagged), vengeful ghosts (pangguah), and a variety of other ghouls/monsters. Religious practitioners known as djin (shamans) communicate with spirits, officiate rites of passage, and serve as ritual leaders. Magic is also present, and include the practices of anting-anting (the wearing of protective amulents), and kabolan (spells and formulas used to being about desired ends such as weather changes). The most important social unit of the Badjau is the nuclear family, which will occasionally come together at moorages to form family alliance units that cooperate for work activities and religious ceremonies. In addition to family alliances, the Badjau recognize about seven localized kin groups (comprised of related family alliance units that regularly moor together).

686,Popoluca,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Popoluca are a group of people who live in eastern Veracruz and Oaxaca, Mexico. Linguistically, there are four groups of Popoluca: the Sierra, Texistepec, Oluta, and Sayula. This entry focuses on the Sierra Popoluca (the largest of the four groups) living specifically in the town and environs of Soteapan, Veracruz around the time of 1950. This region has a long history of cultural contact with outsiders beginning with the Spanish arrival in the sixteenth century. With the Spanish came Catholic missionaries, who built churches, preached, and converted natives. Consequently, the Popoluca are now nominally Catholic. However, Catholic ideas and practices (including the Christian God and rites such as baptism and marriage) have been blended with indigenous beliefs. Elements of former religion can be seen in the variety of supernatural beings as well as rites and ceremonies associated with agricultural and subsistence practices. Priests occasionally visit the area, but no full-time religious leaders are present otherwise. Magical practitioners known as nawats/nawals are present and practice malevolent magic--these individuals can be described as magical practitioners. Religion does not exist within its own distinct sphere of life, but rather pervades all aspects of Popoluca life; this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with Popoluca society.",1915,1945,909,577,Emily Pitek,1,M.

689,Lengua,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Lengua are native to the Paraguayan Chaco of South America. In 1889 the Church of England South American Missionary Society began to work in the Lenguaâs native territory as missionary Barbrooke Grubb began a 20 year residence among the Lengua living by the Chaco bank of the Paraguay River. Although Grubb was not an anthropologist, his detailed field notes from this time have become the principal ethnographic authority on the Lengua. This entry focuses on the Lengua band in contact with the mission around the time of 1889. At this time, the Lengua were living in autonomous bands and villages with little social distinctions; chiefs only held rule when needed for the common good (such as in times of war). Magical-practitioners were present, with their main task to protect the village from supernatural evils. These practitioners could also affect the weather and foretell future events. The Lengua supernatural beings included a vague and otiose creator deity (symbolized by a beetle), kilyikhama (malignant spirits), aphangak (departed souls of men, who would stay around for about a month after death, then traveling to the afterlife), and departed souls of lower creations.

691,Fur,43,Religious Group (v6),"âDarfur, or Darfor, means the land of the Fors, who were once the owners and sole inhabitants of the whole province. They have, however, been driven back into the western part of the country, the remainder of which is now inhabited by various invadersâ¦â (Felkin, 1885:205). This entry focuses on the Fur living in the Jebel Marra area of Darfur around the time of 1880. Although Darfur was taken by the Egyptians in the 1870âs, the province of Jebel Marra was not actually subjugated until 1881 when the last sultan (Haroun) was killed. Darfur later became a province of Sudan in the 1910âs. At the time this entry focuses on, Darfur was divided into five provinces (each ruled by an official), with each province subdivided into smaller districts led by local governors. A hereditary sultan oversaw Darfur as a whole. After centuries of cultural contact with Arab peoples and Islamic beliefs, the Fur are primarily Muslim, but elements of their original beliefs remain (such as agricultural festivals, and they have laws differing from those of the Koran). The Fur religious beliefs center on Molu, the one high god. Also present are spirits of the deceased, but these supernatural beings are not involved in daily life. Religious practitioners known as puggeeâs had influence over the Sultan and chiefs, and were often more powerful than chiefs. Any male could become a puggee after training in reading, writing, and the Koran, as well as Fur law. Religion does not have its own distinctive sphere in Fur life; rather, it is bound up with the functioning of society as a whole. Consequently, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society.",1870,1895,912,577,Emily Pitek,1,M.

710,Hidatsa,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Hidatsa are native to the North American Plains, and traditionally lived in semipermanent villages along the upper Missouri River and its tributaries in what is now northwestern North Dakota. Since 1868, the Hidatsa (along with the Mandan and Arikara) have lived on the Fort Berthold Reservation in North Dakota. This entry focuses on Hidatsa society as it existed prior to the last major smallpox outbreak of 1837, which decimated the Hidatsa population and marked the beginning of more intensive and frequent contact with Europeans and Americans, and subsequent cultural change. This entry relies mainly on information collected by principal ethnographic authority Alfred W. Bowers, who completed fieldwork at Fort Berthold Reservation from 1932-1933. Bowers used the memories of older informants, archaeological data, and early records to reconstruct the period of time prior to 1837. Historically, the Hidatsa lived in three independent villages along the Knife River: Hidatsa-proper, Awatixa, and Awakawi. Each village was led by a council composed of chiefs and ceremonial and war leaders; top leadership positions were held by the owners of certain sacred ceremonial bundles specific to each village. The three villages had a tribal council (of about 10 members) charged with defense against common enemies and the general welfare of the villages. The Hidatsa did not have a clear distinction between secular and religious roles: ceremonial leaders held status equal with or greater than that of chiefs. Social organization centered around elaborate clan and age-grade systems. A clan was a named matrilineal group associated with its own traditions and mythology and was responsible for taking care of its members. Clans cut across villages, and were important aspects of social, economic, and ceremonial life. Additionally, ââ¦the entire male and female population was arranged in a series of groupings based on age. For the greater part of the population, these groups were formally organized with names, symbols of membership, songs, and prescribed rites and rules of behaviorâ (Bowers, 1954:174). Both men and women had religious societies within the age-grade system, and men also had military societies. An individualâs clan and age-grade determined his or her position/role in the village, as well as social and ceremonial duties. The Hidatsa have an extensive and elaborate ceremonial system associated with various supernatural beings, natural phenomena, and agricultural and subsistence cycles. It is important to note that âat the base of all Hidatsa religious activities and concepts is the belief in individual and group-owned supernatural powers which are controlled according to long-standing rulesâ (Bowers, 1965:282). These supernatural powers are acquired from supernatural beings during vision experiences, and are associated with either tribal or personal sacred bundles. The owner of a sacred/ritual bundle also possesses the associated myth and ceremonial procedures. The owner thus leads the associated ceremony and is responsible for knowing where it lies in the ceremonial cycle (e.g. which ceremonies precede and follow). The ceremonial system is open to the occasional introduction of new bundle rites (the result of purchase or vision experiences).  Because Hidatsa religious beliefs and practices are interwoven throughout society as a whole, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with Hidatsa society itself.",1816,1840,923,577,Emily Pitek,1,M.

There is no central political authority among the Igbo; the largest social unit is the village-group, bound together by ties but each village is functionally independent. In fact, there is âno individual of outstanding power or authority either directly in things spiritual or indirectly in things secular (Green, 1964:49).â Although there are not official religious leaders among the Igbo, there are two types of religious practitioners: priests and dibeas. Hereditary priests observe taboos and lead ceremonies, but are otherwise viewed as âordinaryâ members of the community (Green, 1964:53). A dibea, on the other hand, undergoes training and initiation rites to become a specialist in the professions of diviner and/or doctor-magician. Various types of supernatural beings are present. There is belief in a supreme high god who is largely viewed as an otiose creator deity overseeing the world from above, and is not typically worshipped directly. Additionally present are the spirits of deceased humans, and ancestor worship appears to be the concern/responsibility of individual households and families. Several non-human spirits are also present, including village and village-group deities. Larger-scale rituals/ceremonies/celebrations are present, such as the annual rites surrounding the worship of the village-group deity. It is important to note the presence of Christian influence among the Igbo, beginning with the arrival of missionaries in the mid 1800âs. The religious realm of Igbo life is not distinct, but is bound in the functioning of the society as a whole. Consequently, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society.

721,Semang,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Semang are native inhabitants of the Malay Peninsula. The Semang have little formal social organization or administrative units; the individual family is the primary social unit, followed by the local group (sub-tribe/group). These subgroups do not possess a higher level of jurisdictional hierarchy. âAt least nine distinct cultural-linguistic subgroups still exist: Kensiu of eastern Kedah (near Baling) and southern Thailand (Yala Province); Kintak of northwestern Perak (near Gerik); Jahai of northestern Perak and northwestern Kelantan; LanÃ²h of northwestern Perak (near Gerik); Mendriq of central Kelantan; BatÃ¨k DÃ¨' of southeastern Kelantan and northern Pahang; BatÃ¨k NÃ²ng of central Pahang (near Jerantut); Mintil of north-central Pahang (near Cegar Perah); and Mos (or Chong) of the Pattalung-Trang area in southern peninsular Thailandâ (Endicott and Abate, 2009). This entry focuses specifically on the Jahai (alt. sp. Jahay) around the time of 1925, and uses the terms Jahai and Semang interchangeably. The Semang do not possess a formal leadership office, either religious or secular. However, a religious specialist is present, and is called halaâ. The halaâ has the special abilities of communicating with the supernatural realm, and serves as medicine-man. An individual becomes halaâ either through a dream, hereditary transmission, or taking possession of the Äebu stone (which has ritual importance). The term Orang hidop refers to supernatural beings, and is best translated as âthe immortalsâ. The orang hidop include spirits of the dead--who linger for several days but ultimately travel to the realm of the dead--as well as other, non-human beings. Of primary importance is the supreme high god Karei, god of thunder, followed by Ta Penân. Also present are Kareiâs wife Manoij, their sons and daughter, Kareiâs servants, and the Äenoi (celestial spirit-beings closely related to the halaâ). The Semangâs most important religious ritual is the blood sacrifice ceremony, during which individuals must draw and sacrifice their own blood in order to appease Karei either after breaking a taboo, or during thunderstorms to prevent further catastrophes. For the Semang, religious aspects of life are not differentiated from the secular.

722,Gros Ventre,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Gros Ventre are native to the plains of North America. The name âGros Ventreâ is a French interpretation of their sign language, and translates to âlarge bellyâ. This Algonkian-speaking, historically nomadic people refer to themselves as Aâani, meaning âwhite-Clay Peopleâ, and are also known by the Blackfoot name Atsina. In the late 1880âs the Gros Ventre, along with the Assiniboin, were relocated to Fort Belknap Reservation in northern Montana. This entry focuses around the time of 1835-1885, with tribal territory centering around the Milk River, and the Belknap Reservation representing a small portion of Gros Ventre held land. Principal ethnographic authorities use fieldwork, informant accounts, and primary documents to reconstruct Gros Ventre life prior to 1885, which marked the end of the buffalo era and the beginning of consistent missionary contact. The Gros Ventre were traditionally comprised of about 12 bands, each led by a respective chief who was distinguished in war and recognized as the bandâs leader. Each band also had a Flat Pipe and a Feathered Pipe Keeper, both of whom served as religious leaders while also possessing political influence. The bands would periodically come together as a tribal unit, which was led by a tribal leader. Ceremonial organization cut across band organization, and most religious ceremonies were held at the tribal level. Gros Ventre political and religious life were interwoven, and this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society at large. Gros Ventre religious beliefs included a Supreme Being, who was considered to be the ultimate ruler and controller of all other supernatural beings, as well as the Earth and its inhabitants. The Supreme Being ranked highest in importance; he was always invoked first and received first offerings.

The Gikuyu live in central Kenya in the administrative districts of Kiambu, Fort Hall (Murangâa), Nyeri, Embu, and Meru (as defined in the 1920âs). This entry focuses specifically on the Gikuyu living in the Fort Hall District of Kenya around the time of 1920. By this time, British colonialists held political control over the Gikuyu, and Christian missionaries had arrived in the area. Despite such contact, the Gikuyu culture and religious beliefs at the specific time and place this entry focuses on remains largely traditional. Gikuyu socio/political organization centers around three factors: the family group (mbari/nyomba), the clan (moherega), and an age-grading (riika) system that unites the whole society. The family, led by a patriarch, is the main social, economic, and religious unit. No full-time religious specialists (such as priests or shamans) are present. Rather, ""in religious ceremonies, and in political and social gatherings, the elders hold supreme authority"" (Kenyatta, 1953:263). Elders serve as intermediaries between Ngai (the high god) and ancestral spirits, and maintained communication with these beings (especially through the form of sacrificial ceremonies). The highest status for a Gikuyu man is the religious or sacrificial council (Kiama Kia Maturanguru), which is reached after passing through and being initiated into all age-grades. The religious and sacrificial council are considered âholy menâ who are charged with leading all religious and ethical ceremonies. For the Gikuyu, religion is interwoven with all aspects of life; this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society itself.",1895,1930,937,577,Emily Pitek,1,M.

752,Haroi,43,Religious Group (v6),"Contemporary Haroi traditional religion involves the practice polytheistic and animistic beliefs. The origins of the Haroi have been highly debated. One position argues that they were a distinct Bahnaric ethno-linguistic group from the ChampÄ civilization (2nd â 19th centuries). Another argues they were a group of former Cham people that fled into the uplands after a war with Äáº¡i Viá»t (15th century) and then resettled into uplands, midlands, and eventually, some lowland areas. The second argument is more pervasive in Vietnamese language academia and within the contemporary Hâroi community. Oral histories still circulate, tying the Hâroi to the refugees of the royal court of Vijaya, the ChampÄ polity that was conquered in 1471 CE by Äáº¡i Viá»t. The also state Hâroi had to adopt practices from neighboring ethnic groups to blend in and not be pursued by Äáº¡i Viá»t militaries. Therefore, their spiritual activities became quite similar to the Bahnaric groups, while retaining some Chamic (Ede, Churu, etc.) beliefs. Their language is also classified as a Bahnaric language by recent studies in historical linguistics. Regardless of the origins hypothesis, their roots seem to be in the ChampÄ civilization, followed by a period of becoming a distinct group (15th â 17th century), while assimilating into greater Bahnaric communities [perhaps âagain,â likely âfor the first timeâ] from the 15th â 20th century.

759,Comanche,43,Religious Group (v6),"Historically, the Comanche inhabited the southern Great Plains region of what is now the United States, including southeastern Colorado, eastern New Mexico, western Oklahoma, and western Texas (Gelo and Abate, 2009). This area was restricted with the 1865 Treaty of the Little Arkansas, which bound many Comanche to the Texas panhandle area, and later the Medicine Lodge Creek Treaty of 1867, which outlined a joint Kiowa-Comanche-Apache reservation in Oklahoma. However, many Comanche did not reside on reservations until forced to by an army campaign in 1874-1875. This entry focuses on the Comanche around the time of 1870, reconstructing life prior to the reservation era and consequent culture change. At this time, the Comanche lived in autonomous, nomadic bands, following the seasonal movements of the buffaloâa key source of subsistence and materials necessary for life on the plains. âThe Comanche band, or local group, ranged in size from a single family camping alone, through the small camp of related individuals who formed a composite extended family, up to the large band of several hundred personsâ (Hoebel, 1940:11). Band size changed depending on the season, with larger bands functioning as a unit only in the summer months. Regardless of size, each band (or local group) had a permanent leader, typically an individual who possessed great importance and ability. When bands came together in the summer, the leaders formed a council and selected one individual as leader for the season with the others serving as an advisory council. Generally, the Comanche religion was not a formal, communal matter as âthere was no religious organization, no theocracy, no priestly class, no dogmaâ (Wallace and Hoebel, 1952:155). However, religion remained an important aspect of Comanche life, and this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with Comanche society. A high god known as the Great Spirit is described as an omniscient and omnipotent creator deity associated with the sun. The Great Spirit is generally otiose in nature, and acts through inferior spirits. The sun, Earth, and moon are also viewed as deities. Other supernatural beings include Thunderbird, spirits of the deceased, dwarf people, and guardian spirits. Vision quests are not mandatory, but most individuals participate. During a vision quest, individuals isolate themselves for several days, fasting and attempting to derive supernatural power (medicine) through âa mystic visitation, a dream phenomenon, or hallucinatory experienceâ (Wallace and Hoebel, 1952:155). In a successful vision quest, a guardian spirit will appear to an individual, often in the form of an animal, and transfer supernatural power. Although full-time religious practitioners are not present among the Comanche, individuals known as medicine men have acquired a large amount of supernatural powers (medicine), which can be used for curing, rainmaking, and divination.",1855,1880,964,577,Emily Pitek,1,M.

839,19th century German Protestantism,43,Religious Group (v6),"German Protestantism of the 18th and 19th century, mainly in the Lutheran tradition, was a crucible for widely disseminated theology that continues to influence contemporary Christianity. This period was entrenched within the Enlightenment, and very consciously so. The efforts to systematize theological views and biblical interpretation within the new paradigms of scientific progress and Rationalism greatly influenced both institutional and personal piety in this period. The birth of biblical studies within academic institutions was also developed in this period. Particularly, scholars of theology began applying socio-historical criticism to the Bible in ways that drove the theological debates among the elites. As in many societies, elite discourse did not necessarily affect the day-to-day of practitioners immediately, but many of the developments within the academy did find themselves disseminated broadly, particularly as culminated in the popular works of Adolf Harnack at the end of the 19th century.
For most practitioners, their attentions would have been less on the academic debates and more on their immediate socio-political environment. Germany in the 19th century saw many revolutions, such as that of Napoleon Bonaparte, the end of constitutional monarchy of 1919, the revolutions of 1848-1849 (MÃ¤rzrevolution), the rise of the German Empire, and the industrial revolution, the latter making Germany one of the most powerful nations in Europe. The population grew greatly in this new democracy, creating new opportunities and challenges in itself. Thinkers like Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770-1831) and Karl Marx (1818-1883) greatly influenced the political landscape and fueled ideologies of revolution.
The relationship between the Church and the State also changed greatly in this period. Frederick William III endeavored to unify the Protestant Church. Lutherans, Calivinists, and Reformed congregations made moves to merge their parrishes. Some, particularly the âOld Lutherans,â rejected such moves and emigrated elsewhere to avoid possible sanctions. The United States and Australia were popular destinations for these Lutherans, where they established the âMissouri Synodâ and the Lutheran Church of Australia, respectively.
While many people surely went about their lives without notice of the paradigm shifts Germany was experiencing, the net effect of these changes shook the world on the economic, religious, and social levels. A full understanding of Protestant religion today and the formative events of the 20th century on European and American culture (particularly the World Wars), benefits from a comprehension of the 19th century Protestant developments which fed directly into the creation of modernity.",1788,1914,1008,722,Ryan Fitzgerald,18,Robyn Walsh,2020-07-16 11:01:59.669 +0200,2020-08-15 22:51:29.429 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),1.659382374576437e-05,0.06935323327171636,4.153459470763861e-15,0.029359264512693564,0.001381574841569608,1.3623243296591488e-12,8.116663245268205e-06,0.8023636539438169,0.09751756294184609
842,American Evangelicalism,43,Religious Group (v6),"American Evangelicalism is a subset of American Christianity that spans numerous denominational groups including Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians, and Pentecostals among others. A theologically diverse movement, American Evangelicals are often recognized for their emphasis on revivalism and personal religious conversion. The movement lacks a centralized institutional leader, but diverse local, regional, and national networks help reinforce religious authority. 

American Evangelical beginnings can be traced back to the early eighteenth century when a series of religious revivals took place in colonial New England. Preachers like Jonathan Edwards and George Whitefield along with lay leaders like Sarah Osborn preached a version of Christianity that prioritized a personal conversion experience in which individuals became assured of their salvation. By privileging an individual experience, evangelical adherents gained the power to proclaim their faith in God giving some scholars the impression that the movement âdemocratizedâ Christianity. While individuals may have gained some authority through this emphasis on a personal religious experience, an individualâs community functioned to help evaluate and verify whether experiences were genuine. 

Revivals and worship services that seek to encourage a conversion experience have been hallmarks of the American Evangelical movement. These large events include singing hymns and preaching and could take place either in a church or outside as with the Cane Ridge Reveal of 1801. Individuals like Dwight Moody, Billy Sunday, and Aimee Semple McPherson carried this revivalistic tradition into the twentieth century. Today, large Mega Churches like Saddleback Church in California effectively turn Sunday worship services into large revivalistic events. Not all American Evangelical churches are large, however, and many have no more than a couple hundred members.

American Evangelicals are incredibly effective institution builders, utilizing technological innovation, print culture, higher education, and marketing tactics to attract new members as well as shape and reinforce their identity. From organizations like the American Tract Society to evangelical Colleges and Universities, American Evangelicals have been successful through constructing institutions and accruing wealth as a result of these institutions. 

Coupled with their institution building, American Evangelicals are also politically active. In the nineteenth century this political activism took the form of moral reform societies, and by the twentieth century, evangelical political activism became more intensely wedded to partisan politics. In 1976, the magazine Newsweek declared it the âYear of the Evangelicalâ spurred in large part to the election of President Jimmy Carter, a self described âBorn Again,â evangelical Christian. American Evangelicals continued to exercise significant political influence in American political life well into the twenty-first century, and overwhelmingly supported the election of Donald Trump in 2016.",1730,2020,1011,728,Andrew Gardner,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-16 18:25:05.960 +0200,2020-08-21 16:57:02.510 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.0003036857640932551,0.026341806773536147,1.778897188823537e-15,0.033433137816339595,0.00013187420492354575,2.2090623598624163e-12,6.549260936274293e-05,0.9113341694201208,0.02838983340941306
843,Bnay QyÄmÄ and BnÄt QyÄmÄ,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Bnay QyÄmÄ and BnÄt QyÄmÄ (""Sons of the Covenant"" and ""Daughters of the Covenant"" respectively) were Syriac Christian ascetics first attested in the fourth century CE. These individuals, sworn to an ascetic and celibate life, served public and liturgical functions within Syriac churches and communities. Evidence of their activities survives in remarks in a variety of religious treatises and hagiographical texts as well as rules promulgated by religious leaders. This article summarizes the known origins, social significance, and ecclesiastical functions of the bnay/bnÄt qyÄmÄ.


The precise social and linguistic origins of the designation are debated. The noun often translated âcovenantâ (qyÄmÄ) derives from the root qwm (âto standâ), and it has a wide range of meanings, including status, station, oath, and contract. Robert Murray has suggested an origin for the term in baptismal rites, where the catechumen took a proverbial âstandâ and rose from the waters (Murray 1974/5). According to another view, the related noun for âresurrectionâ (qyÄmtÄ) may have played a role in this use of bnay qyÄmÄ (cf. Luke 20:36). Finally, M.R. Macina has argued that the term related to Greek kanon and tentatively proposed that the bnay qyÄmÄ â âmembers of the [church] institutionâ â were more integrated into the clerical hierarchy (Macina 1999).


If we are to believe fourth and fifth-century martyr narratives which claim that children of the covenant were targeted in the persecutions of Diocletian and Shapur II, âcovenantersâ probably existed as pre-monastic ascetic movement in the third century (Harvey 2005, 126). The most important early source is Aphrahatâs sixth demonstration which dates to around 336/7 and describes the renunciatory ideal of the bnay qyÄmÄ. His text, replete with military and athletic imagery, exhorts the children of the covenant to reject the refinements and attachments of the world and instead embrace a spiritual marriage with Christ.


Aside from passing references to the group in hagiographies and church histories, most of our knowledge of the bnay/bnÄt qyÄmÄ derives from lists of canons, most notably the rules attributed to Rabbula, bishop of Edessa in 411-32 (see Phenix and Horn 2017), but also in canons attributed to Maruta of Maipherqat in the fifth-century and John of Tella in the sixth-century (see VÃ¶Ã¶bus 1975 and 1982). These rules prescribe communal and celibate living, either with ones family or with fellow children of the covenant (of the same sex). It can be inferred that vows of poverty were not required based on their prohibition from usury and exemption from collections from priests. Clothing was to be uniform and modest, and outside business and legal entanglements were not allowed. Prayer and fasting were their primary responsibilities, but they also cared for church administration, the staffing of hospitals, and the care of the poor.


One feature of the âcovenantersâ which distinguishes them from later monastic communities in the west was their central role in public liturgical singing. The bnÄt qyÄmÄ were particularly unique in this regard (on which, see Harvey 2005). The fifteenth canon of the synod of Phrygian Laodicea restricted singing in church to these women. According to Jacob of Sarug, Ephrem the Syrian (late 4th c.) established a choir of women to sing his hymns. In this role, they embodied and taught the eschatological and soteriological ideals of the wider religious community. 


By the medieval period the bnay/bnÄt qyÄmÄ had declined in importance. On the one hand, the bnÄt qyÄmÄ became assimilated with deaconesses and nuns. On the other hand, bnay qyÄmÄ were eclipsed by both clerics within the ecclesiastic hierarchy and cenobitic monks. Aside from a smattering of literary references, the bnay/bnÄt qyÄmÄ had largely disappeared by the tenth century.

The geographic extent of the bnay/bnÄt qyÄmÄ was much broader than the region marked here, namely the Roman province of Osroene in the fifth century, which was chosen both for the sake of simplicity and due to the importance of Edessa as a cultural and religious center. Syriac Christianity and the institution of the bnay/bnÄt qyÄmÄ certainly extended into other provinces of the Roman empire and the Persian empire to the east.",300,900,1012,724,Jonathan Warner,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-16 19:20:53.242 +0200,2020-08-15 19:03:19.860 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.00040761062357431776,0.10223792521578688,2.286853904036602e-15,0.49973705245230277,0.0007353651688266295,0.26158548394358927,0.0001482574452254223,0.13514814216367627,1.6298701611805988e-07
846,Xuanzang's YogÄcÄra Tradition,43,Religious Group (v6),"This entry is aimed to document the religious beliefs and activities of Xuanzang and his major dharma heirs. Xuanzang (intentionally or subconsciously) established the ""YogÄcÄra"" tradition, which he deemed as the genuine form of MahÄyÄna Buddhism, in China. 

Xuanzang is one of the most famous pilgrims in world history who took an arduous journey to India, studied at the Nalanda Monastery, and introduced thousands of Buddhist scriptures to China. After returning from India, Xuanzang accompanied the Emperor Taizong of Tang for a period of time. Later, with the royal patronage, he initiated mass translation projects and thus also renowned as one of the âFour Greatest Chinese Buddhist translators.â

Within his translation teams, a few members became his intimate disciples, e.g. Kuiji, Woncheuk and Puguang. They carried and developed Xuanzangâs teaching and wrote many commentaries to explain this sophisticated scholastic Buddhist tradition. As a request received from Kuiji, Xuanzang, based on the works of the ten greatest YogÄcÄra commentators at the Nalanda Monastery, manufactured the classic compendium Cheng weishi lun, which later became the most seminal text not only for the whole YogÄcÄra tradition but also for the whole Chinese Buddhism tradition. 

Despite its particularity, this tradition is far from institutionalized and only bonded by their doctrinal proclivities. Societally speaking, this tradition did not last more than a century. Its cradle place, the Great Ciâen Temple, soon became Tantric-focused. The tradition neither has a patriarchal system by itself nor provide a clear dharma-transmission narrative. After two generations, the number of commentaries gradually diminished. Since then, this strand of YogÄcÄra thoughts is fully dismantled into Chinese Buddhist traditions, such as Chan and Huayan. Along with four major and minor transmission, this tradition is transmitted into Japan and became fully sectarianized as the HossÅ sect, which remained as one of the strongest Buddhist sects in Japan.
 
This idiosyncratic tradition offers a set of unique doctrines, such as ""eight consciousnesses and four aspects"" and âthree natures,â which represents the Abhidharmic psychological wing of YogÄcÄra Buddhism. It offers a unique soteriological path by analyzing oneâs cognitive process and subsequently acquire the divine cognition to perceive the âtrue natureâ (buddha-nature, so-to-speak) of existence. The title of Xuanzangâs compendium expresses the central idea of this traditionââmerely consciousness.â  Its philosophy draws a similarity with Kantian Transcendental Idealism, which asserts the world we human perceived is bonded by our epistemological limit and supported by a transcendental cognito, and Husserlian Phenomenology, which suspends the ontological inquiry and shifts to study and propose a universal cognitive structure that we human perceive experience. And therefore, nowadays, this tradition is commonly rendered as the Buddhist phenomenology, which contributed enormously to modern scientific disciplines, e.g. cognitive science, psychology, and science of mind.",645,696,1015,727,Guanxiong Qi,45,Matthew Hamm,2020-07-17 18:17:06.827 +0200,2021-09-29 20:32:31.454 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),5.915485343996967e-14,2.287589052856038e-25,0.9999999999996536,2.838490744876317e-13,1.2348792131737833e-15,1.4642852240808879e-47,4.4596058834883527e-26,4.972740660821867e-27,2.158816112167524e-15
848,Sadducees,43,Religious Group (v6),"One of the three primary sects in Second Temple Judaism (alongside the Pharisees and Essenes). The Sadducees are primarily known as being comprised of the social elites, many of whom were part of the priestly society of Jerusalem. The Sadducees that fit this description were heavily involved in political and religious affairs, including the oversight of the temple. Sadducees, however, were also found outside of Jerusalem in the region of ancient Palestine and included Jews of every social class. The only known shared belief among all Sadducees is the determination for a return of the priestly dynasty. The Sadducee's demise is frequently tied to the destruction of the Jerusalem temple by the Romans in 70 CE, though it is likely that Jews continued to identify with the group even after this event.
The name Sadducee and the origins of the movement are still cloaked in uncertainty. Scholars believe that linguistically the name Sadducee is derived from one of two Hebrew origins. While some propose that the term is related to the Hebrew term tzaddik (ârighteousâ) and provides context to the movements beliefs, others connect the term to the figure Zadok, the high priest in the days of David and Solomon and argue that the group is in some way connected to a priestly lineage. Although these explanations have been held up as insights into the origins of the Jewish sect and have been used to hint at the early history of the group, there is not enough primary information available to know for certain if there is any tie between the name and the movementâs history. References to Sadducees first appear in the literature of the Hasmonaean period, but there is no definitive history of the sect, though some posit that the elitism of the sect has its origins in earlier periods.
Many of the perceived insights into the Sadducees (close connection with outside rulers, highly Hellenized, etc.) stem from equating elitism with various aspects of culture and society in the late Second Temple period. These conclusions, however, are largely erroneous as the primary source material describing the Sadducees is very limited. Most of the information about the Sadducees aligns with the beliefs and practices of Second Temple Judaism, while distinctive characteristics are derived from what is said about them in the Greek New Testament and what is preserved in the writings of Josephus. Later Christian commentators rely exclusively upon these sources in their discussions of the Jewish sect. Additional information can be gleaned from Tannaitic references that highlight arguments between the tsadukim (likely the Sadducees) and perushim (likely the Pharisees). Ultimately, we have to be cautious and follow the statement of Lawrence Schiffman who stated, ""the views of the Pharisees and Sadducees must remain shrouded in mystery.""",-200,70,485,731,Joshua Matson,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-17 21:22:27.375 +0200,2020-08-14 01:50:54.766 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),2.864745315561335e-27,6.5683197207483975e-31,4.995521148271405e-12,0.9999999999950012,1.7133759088762948e-36,2.8438496841452617e-45,1.1690534152431318e-16,1.3011920310164282e-24,3.1076917236940908e-15
849,"""Gaiwiio Religion,"" ""Longhouse Religion,"" or ""The Way of Handsome Lake"" of the Seneca Tribe",43,Religious Group (v6),"""Gaiwiio,"" ""The Way of Handsome Lake,"" or simply ""The Good Message,"" is a new religious movement that emerged among the Seneca tribe of present-day northeastern U.S in the early 19th century. It combined moral and theological elements of Protestant Christianity (especially Quakerism) with Iroquois rituals and cosmology. The founder of the movement, Handsome Lake (1735-1815), was from the Seneca tribe--one of the six great nations of the Iroquois Confederacy (1722-1867). The movement, popularly referred to as ""Longhouse Religion,"" remains active today.

In 1799 Handsome Lake, brother to the Seneca war chief Cornplanter, experienced a vision while in a fevered state. This vision marked the beginning of the Gaiwiio religion. While laying bedbound, Handsome Lake pondered the misfortune of his tribe. The Seneca, once a proud Iroquois Nation, had become a broken people during the burgeoning expansion of a young America. Poverty and alcoholism, in particular, had laid waste to his people. As he drifted into sleep, he was visited by three spirits, which made him well again and, additionally, bestowed upon him a message from the Great Creator and commanded him to spread the instruction among his people. 

The Next day, at the Strawberry Festival, a healthy Handsome Lake conveyed this divinely delivered message to all who had attended. The message primarily contained instructions from the Creator on how to order society on earth. It preached against four ""words"" or evils which the people were to avoid: whiskey, witchcraft, love-magic, and abortion or sterility. Those guilty of these acts must repent to Handsome Lake, or, if the transgression was severe enough, to the Creator. From accounts taken by Quakers at the Strawberry festival, we know that this message was well received and that one could ""feel the weight of the Spirit"" and ""the love of God"" present and flowing among the audience (Wallace 1969, 242). 

In the years to come (1799-1801), Handsome Lake would have new visions sent to him by spirits sent on behalf of the Creator. The second essential vision set out an apocalyptic theology for the followers of Handsome Lake. In it, he saw the death of the earth and the eternal fate of the wicked and the good. The sinful suffered at the hands of the Tormentor (or Punisher), while the righteous reunited with the Great Spirit in the Heaven World. A third vision instructed Handsome Lake to spread his Gospel to all Indians. Thus at the end of these three visions, Gaiwiio had its essential form. It was concerned with living righteously on earth for the sake of eternity, fascinated with the inevitable destruction of the planet, and aimed to convert as many Indians as possible to its ranks.",1750,1850,1016,732,James Waters,5,Courtney Fitzsimmons,2020-07-17 22:37:21.359 +0200,2020-07-23 20:44:39.788 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),7.300442062868499e-18,1.3788912825298188e-16,0.9999999999999666,6.4429432150716015e-21,3.0831153549139834e-14,4.518983672763975e-48,5.267476721121641e-16,1.6867707562049863e-37,1.8892317800470427e-15
851,Sikhism in the United States,43,Religious Group (v6),"Sikhs first immigrated to the United States in 1899 from Punjab. During this time, as they were adapting to life in a new country, religion remained an important factor. In the early 1900s, Sikhs remained adamant in wanting to retain their culture and religion. In a 1910 article, âThe Tide of the Turbans,â Herman Scheffauer, a German-American journalist, notes that:

âIt was the same son of India who, wishing to become a citizen of the United States, refused to remove his turban while taking the oath and so remained a British subject. Always the turban remains, the badge and symbol of their native land, their native customs and religion. Whether repairing tracks on the long stretches of the Canadian or Northern Pacific railways, feeding logs into the screaming rotary saws of the lumber-mills, picking fruit in the luxuriant orchards or sunny hillsides of California, the twisted turban shows white or brilliant, a strange, exotic thing in the western landscape.â
As decades went by, Sikhsâ mentality about Sikhism adapted. By the mid-1940s, Sikhs at Stockton Gurdwara introduced chairs inside the gurdwara, so worshippers were not required to sit on the floor. The community even dropped the requirements for people to remove their shoes and cover their heads when they enter the gurdwara. If one was to walk inside Stockton Gurdwara, the physical space would resemble the inside of a church more than a gurdwara. Bruce LaBrack notes that this is âbecause they were better educated and more at ease in the American culture milieu [and] began to question some of the practices associated with Sikh Worship.â Sikh practices were classified by Sikhs of this time as âbackward and unnecessarily strict interpretations of gurdwara etiquette,â which is completely different than the terminology and spirit of the first wave of immigrants. With the Immigration Act of 1965 allowing more Sikhs to immigrate to the United States, Sikhism reverted back to its more traditional form. Following the 9/11 attacks, many Sikhs have been victims of hate crimes throughout the United States mainly due to two things: the color of their skin and their turbans. As a matter of fact, the first victim of a hate crime in the aftermath of 9/11 was Balbir Singh Sodhi, a Sikh. Despite the struggle they face in America, Sikhs remain resilient. Today, the number of Sikhs in the United States has grown to over 500,000 with a number of new non-Punjabi converts joining the faith â mainly through the Healthy, Happy, Holy Organization (3HO) started by Harbhajan Singh also known as âYogi Bhajan.â Throughout the entire history of Sikhs in the United States, their faith continues to be a key component. This section will look at Sikhism in the United States from when they first immigrated in 1899 to the present day.",1899,2020,1018,740,Tejpaul Singh Bainiwal,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-18 18:55:32.157 +0200,2020-07-23 06:20:57.790 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),8.280394038991037e-07,0.0017336926330442,0.0015727088354982471,0.01789957865863001,0.014150313706482204,5.765102672562781e-24,7.359399894244026e-07,4.112795993141033e-12,0.9646421421828393
854,pre-Christian Irish,43,Religious Group (v6),"Unlike Great Britain and Continental Europe, for which almost everything we know about the pre-Christian religion of the Celtic-speaking peoples comes from either Classical writers or archaeology, Ireland provides us with an abundance of medieval vernacular literature purporting to tell us about the pre-Christian period.  Indeed, the religion of the Irish Iron Age survived to varying degrees well after the introduction of Christianity in the fifth century CE.  Also unlike the Celtic cultures of Britain and the Continent, where the traditional learned class was systematically attacked and suppressed by the Romans, the pre-Christian Irish had a learned class that continued to flourish, maintaining oral historical records, overseeing the legal and educational systems, and carrying out a variety of religious functions.  It is to this learned class that we owe most of our knowledge of the old religion, as their educational system made heavy use of memorization of verse and prose stories, which were thus originally pedagogical, meant to serve as mnemonic devices to help in remembering other knowledge.  These included information about not only the religion but also the natural world, history, proper behavior, and much else.  Because they played a key role in the educational system, they were designed to also be entertaining and thus more easily remembered.  It is probably because of its pedagogical role that this oral material was eventually preserved, written down by scribes based in the Christian monasteries despite its rich pagan content.  Nonetheless, this preservation appears to have been selective, as the scribes would have been inclined to minimize those elements involving the older faith.  The manuscript literature thus provides us with information about many of the deities (Tuatha DÃ©), but it provides little information on specific beliefs or rituals, although much in the new religion appears to have been compatible with the old.  It has even been suggested that Christianity first gained a foothold in Ireland through its acceptance by the younger members of the learned class, who saw it as offering only a somewhat different perspective on their existing beliefs,   But as a result, the manuscript material must be used carefully as we cannot be certain that elements within it were not invented within the monasteries rather than reflecting true tradition.  A few things do seem clear.  The old religion and its gods were tied closely to the landscape and the annual agricultural cycle.  The gods occupied an invisible Otherworld closely paralleling our own.  And there was a strong belief in reincarnation.  So, to be fair, though there are many hints in the medieval manuscript literature, we really have almost no direct evidence contemporary with the period in question that can provide us with unbiased information about the nature of the religion.  What I have presented here is, therefore, based on my personal evaluation of these early manuscript materials and a scattering of other evidence.  Other scholars may well disagree with my interpretations, as I tend to assume more continuity in beliefs than some others do.  For an in-depth discussion of the issues and difficulties in using this material to reconstruct the pre-Christian religion, see Williams (2016)",-400,900,554,742,Ronald Hicks,9,Ben Raffield,2020-07-18 23:37:03.471 +0200,2022-11-08 23:38:10.999 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.0359106547475855,0.01545943080281526,6.342015643250269e-16,2.72811703455052e-10,8.255713110954155e-16,0.00027154713126916673,0.948358367045517,2.5404620782143063e-21,1.9625515332508194e-31
855,Middle-Class Migrant Muslims in the UAE,43,Religious Group (v6),"The UAE is home to millions of Muslims who exhibit a range of beliefs and practices that reflect the diverse ethnic composition of the country's population. These Muslims are both impacted by local customs and laws governing religion and connected to other places in the world that influence their practice and experiences of religious belonging. In this entry, I provide a general introduction to how religion figures into the lives of middle-class migrant Muslims in the UAE. 

Rather than focus on Emirati citizens, I look at noncitizen residents who have made the UAE their home. This entry is not focused on the working classes of the UAE, employed in sectors like construction or domestic work, nor the ultra-rich, but on migrant Muslims who fall in between the ends of such a spectrumâ the people who constitute the UAEâs teachers, doctors, engineers, and business men and women. These men and women are literate, which gives them greater direct access to religious knowledge, and they are educated professionals, which holds implications for their taste and interests in Islam.

While these middle-class migrant Muslims can be mapped across many theological categories, those considered in this entry would generally be categorized as Sunni Muslim. Despite that, their beliefs and practices extend from Salafi inclined, literalist readings of the Quran, hadith, and Islamic tradition to Sufi oriented practitioners who privilege the interior over the exterior.
What characterizes this religious group is their existence and practice of Islam in a state that is not their own. 

Though their religious practice is governed by the UAE, these migrant Muslims do not have a more permanent claim to a long-term presence there. Moreover, they have connections to other places around the worldâother religious scholars, sources of authority, and communitiesâthat play a role in their experience of Islam. It is the process of navigating such different pulls that makes this group unique.

As middle-class migrant Muslims, they also have the literary abilities, language skills, technologies, time, and freedom which permits them to access religious knowledge quite independentlyâby turning directly to scholars online, published books, or attending Islamic classes in one or multiple languages. This capacity to engage an array of Islamic knowledge introduces them to a range of beliefs and practices in the UAE that they likely would not have had access to in their countries of origin. Such particularities hold implications for how they proceed to embrace their faith.",1900,2020,1021,743,Joud Alkorani,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-19 12:16:20.826 +0200,2020-08-13 13:12:54.092 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),2.2403748831174617e-17,7.776684424093172e-14,0.11541701510770266,3.883519835388415e-12,0.8845594600038786,9.971202909937414e-24,9.300656228395337e-07,3.5167774272453125e-23,2.2594818834552972e-05
857,Wesleyanism,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Methodist/Wesleyan denomination can be said to have commenced in 1738 When John Wesley, an Anglican pastor,  had an experience of the Holy Spirit on the road to Aldersgate in the outskirts of London. He wrote in his Journal, following the teachings of Martin Luther on righteousness that, âI felt my heart strangely warmed. I felt I did trust in Christ, Christ alone, for salvation; and an assurance was given me that He had taken away my sins, even mine, and saved me from the law of sin and death.â  One of the distinctive features of Methodism/Wesleyanism is what has become referred to as its âquadrilateral;,â the four sources of ecclesiastical authority. These consist of scripture, tradition, experience, and reason. This supplements the Anglican threefold sources, which consist of scripture, tradition, and reason.
To the traditional Reformation doctrines of salvation by faith alone (sola fide) and justification by faith, and antinomianism, John Wesley added certain maxims that distinguished his movement from the larger Reformation tradition. Acutely among them was his notion of perfection in love in the earthly life. This notion is rooted in 1 John:1 12, 17, Hebrews 12:1f., and Matthew 5:48. Christians are to be perfect as their heavenly father is, especially in love. Additionally, Wesley emphasized a doctrine known as âArminianismâ (named for the Dutch theologian Jacobus Arminius), a rebuke to the Calvinist notion of predestination. Additionally, he stressed the âmeans of graceâ that include of piety, mercy, as well as social and communal practices. With Calvin, Wesley emphasized the âreal presenceâ of Christ in the Eucharistic elements; against Calvin he prescribed an open Communionâeven the unbaptized are welcome at the Table of the Lord (he referred to Communion as a potential âconverting ordinance.â Another chief ordinance is Holy Baptism, performed either in childhood or in adulthood. The United Methodist Book of Worship contends, âThe Baptismal Covenant is God's word to us, proclaiming our adoption by grace, and our word to God, promising our response of faith and love.â Wesley also borrowed the concepts of prevenient grace, original righteousness, and sanctification from other Christian traditions.
Wesleyâs closest associates were his brother Charles (primarily known for his proficient hymnody) and George Whitefield (himself a Calvinist who believed in predestination), as well as his mother, Susannah who was his foremost spiritual consort. Methodism/Wesleyanism gave birth to the Holiness Movement, which in turn gave birth to Pentecostalism. The Church of Jesus Christ, Latter Day Saints, was formed by a former Methodist. Methodist/Wesleyan denominations today include the United Methodist Church (primarily in the United States but with a large following in sub-Saharan Africa), the Church of the Nazarene, the British Methodists, the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the African Methodist Episcopal Church, Zion, and merged, united denominations in Canada, Zambia, and Australia. Most denominations have an episcopal, connexional polity â a bishop presides over larger collections of congregations, a superintendent over more local collections, and an ordained elder over individual (or multiple) local churches.

858,"The New Prophecy or ""Montanism""",43,Religious Group (v6),"The New Prophecy refers to the Christian prophetic movement led by the prophets Montanus, Maximilla, and Priscilla. Later known as ""Montanism,"" the movement began in the second half of the second century CE in Roman Phrygia, which is in the west-central part of Anatolia, present-day Turkey. It quickly spread beyond Phrygia and, by the mid-third century, had reached Rome, Carthage, Thrace, and Gaul. By the early fifth century, no adherents of the New Prophecy movement remained in North Africa (Optatus of Milevis, Against the Donatists 1.9; Augustine Letter 118.12) or Rome (Praedestinatus, 1.86). In the mid-sixth century, Emperor Justinian I's forces, led by John of Ephesus, attacked Pepouza and burned the group's literature, bringing a decisive end to the already dwindling New Prophecy in Asia Minor. 

	The New Prophecy was controversial. Critics took issue with the movement's ascetic rigor, eschatological beliefs, and the prominent role women played in leading it. However, the most significant source of controversy was the ecstatic prophecies the group's adherents claimed to receive from the Holy Spirit. The movement proclaimed their prophecies constituted supplementary divine revelations with equal or greater authority than those of the previous apostolic traditions. Like the apostle Paul, the New Prophecy, thus, appealed to divine visions as the source of their familiarity with and authorization from Christ. As such, the prophetic movement posed an aggravating challenge to contemporaneous Christian groups whose authority rested entirely upon apostolic succession. 

	In the late third century, the movement was condemned as a heresy. The term ""Montanism"" was bestowed by fourth-century heresiologists.  Later commentators also called adherents of the New Prophecy Cataphrygians, Pepouzians, Quintillianists, and Priscillianists. Scholars have traditionally referred to the New Prophecy movement of the second and third centuries as ""Montanism,"" despite the fact that it is a fourth-century neologism and imbues connotations of heresy not associated with the movement until the late third century. 

	The New Prophecy is known almost exclusively through the third- and fourth-century heresiological accounts of the movement's opponents. These sources also provide fourteen oracles, which scholars believe are genuine expressions of the New Prophecy. A few inscriptions and Tertullian's early third-century writings constitute the only evidence for New Prophecy that survives independently of heresiological texts. Identifying specific texts from Tertullian's corpus as ""Montanist"" has prompted scholars to take Tertullian's views as representative of the broader New Prophecy movement. However, scholars have debated the extent to which Tertullian's early third-century writings represent the New Prophecy movement and its teachings. Several of Tertullian's so-called ""Montanist"" works convey idiosyncratic thoughts that are not consistent with the other evidence for the movement. As such, Tertullian must be treated exclusively as a witness to the New Prophecy's Carthaginian reception in the first decades of the third century and not representative of Montanism elsewhere or at other times.",165,550,1024,753,Camille Leon Angelo,44,Caroline Arbuckle,2020-07-20 18:48:22.807 +0200,2020-08-05 22:25:35.340 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.001436389408412549,0.04349245456468567,2.4205253401043623e-15,0.09946488263213588,0.004850084416834748,0.6940968980955915,0.00022582137595037981,0.15643341393136986,5.557501699752987e-08

Valentinian Christians are best-known for their treatment of God as totally unknowable before Jesus's appearance, their conception of God as a collective entity of Aeons or emanations of the divine, and their belief in a heavenly counterpart that one needed to reunite with.

Our sources for Valentinian thought are split between their own writings and those of their opponents. Until the 20th century, most of our knowledge of the Valentinians came from heresiologists like Irenaeus of Lyons and Tertullian of Carthage, who wrote tractates that stereotyped and condemned their theologies and practices. We also had a few fragments of Valentinusâs own writings and a letter from the Valentinian Ptolemy to Flora embedded in other patristic texts. With the discovery of the Nag Hammadi Codices in the 1940s, we gained access to a broad array of Valentinian texts. These texts gave us a better understanding of Valentinian liturgical practices, exegetical concerns, and cosmological narratives. 

Valentinians have been condemned as heretics since the late second century. However, Valentinus himself was never formally condemned during his lifetime, nor was there any mechanism by which to expel him from the Roman churches in the second century. Valentinians often accused of looking âtoo muchâ like other types of Christians and attending the same services, which made them a threat to some Christians who feared that they were duplicitous.

Valentinians writings and theological explorations have often been depicted as having two substantial trajectories, known as the Eastern and Western schools. However, recent scholarship has questioned a clear divide between the two schools. Likewise, scholars have recently questioned how âValentinianâ Valentinus himself was, since the cosmological and theological concerns of second- and third-century Valentinian writers often turn in very different directions than the fragments of Valentinus that have been preserved. 

Perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of Valentinian thought if their conception of God as androgynous, and that the various emanations of God exist in male-female dyads. This conception of Godâs completeness as based on twoness is also expressed in Valentinian descriptions of union with the divine, in which one joins with their accompanying angel in the ritual of the âbridal chamberâ in order to achieve redemption.",135,400,6,754,Chance Bonar,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-20 18:57:41.614 +0200,2020-07-26 15:32:09.210 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.004591167289478656,1.6419532601417036e-13,0.005405791347717102,0.09174732120541572,0.007516657596194139,4.5422352725997615e-23,4.4552877203423984e-05,1.4263648972768047e-11,0.8906945096695631
860,Kimpa Vita,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Antonian Sect (Antonianism) is a religious movement initiated by Dona BÃ©atrice Kimpa Vita, a young enlightened Kongolese leader, from the eighteen century. This religious  movement advocated for the restoration of the kingdom of Kongo through a spiritual approach grounded on local beliefs and practices, and the rejection of western (missionary) beliefs system perceived as ideological and deleterious to the unity and greatness of the kingdom of Kongo. Kimpa Vita believed that God was not white. She also believed that she was the reincarnation of saint Anthony and used these claims to promote the restoration of a unified and powerful Kingdom of Kongo. The deeper issue behind Kimpa Vita's claims was the idea of ""inculturation"" i.e. christian ideals and values must be understood and interpreted through Kongolese cultural paradigms in order to restore and strengthen the unity of the Kongolese kingdom. Her teaching attracted many followers and ultimately became a threat to the missionaries. She was burnt alive by missionaries in 1706. Despite her death and the collapse of the kingdom of Kongo, Kimpa Vita's spiritual and political intuitions (ideas) are embraced by many African and Congolese people who still perceive her as a prefigure to inculturation and Afrocentrist movements. Nowadays, Kimpa Vita's movement continues in a different way through the ""Ngunza religion"" from Congo-Brazzaville. The Ngunzas venerate and practice a ritual dedicated to Kimpa Vita.

862,Ilm-e-Khshnoom,43,Religious Group (v6),"Ilm-e-Khshnoom 'Science of Bliss' refers to the religious group primarily composed by members of the Zoroastrian diaspora currently settled in India (henceforth Parsis). They follow the system of beliefs (also named Ilm-e-Khshnoom) introduced by Behramshah Naoroji Shroff (1858-1927) at the beginning of the 20th century. Shroffâs teachings are based upon an esoteric interpretation of the Avesta, which is the collection of sacred Zoroastrian scriptures. Ilm-e-Khshnoom emerged from colonial India, when the Westernisation process exposed the religious vulnerability of the Parsi community. The teachings of Shroff are based on a set of universal laws of nature that span from the idea of reincarnation to that of the vibrational power dwelling in the practice of Zoroastrian rituals. Shroff, a Parsi himself, claimed to have been initiated to Ilm-e-Khshnoom by the SÄheb DelÄn 'Master-Hearts', a secluded community of Zoroastrian spiritual masters in Mount DamÄvand, Iran. During his stay, he allegedly acquired abilities like telepathy and divination techniques such as astrology. The Parsis who follow Ilm-e-Khshnoom nowadays are a small minority of the approximatively 50,000 Zoroastrians who live in India, mainly in Mumbai and in some cities of the state of Gujarat. There are not exclusion or inclusion criteria for the membership of this religious group other than being born from a Zoroastrian family. Nevertheless, ethnocentrism characterises not only the adherents of Ilm-e-Khshnoom but a large part of the Parsi community, in contrast to another part of the community which promote religious reformism and conversions. Furthermore, the transmission of Ilm-e-Khshnoom across generations has occurred through the familiar nucleus. In effect, families continue to exert a durable impact on the religious canons as well as on the communal ideology and responsibility of Parsis. The followers of Ilm-e-Khshnoom emphasise a strict observance of the Zoroastrian rituals and adopt particular principles in the ritual practice. These principles remark the importance of addressing precise thoughts while reciting a given portion of the Avesta correctly accompanied by a specific kinetic motion. They also represent distinctive elements of contradistinction of the followers of Ilm-e-Khshnoom against the wider Parsi community. Another distinctive element is the adoption of the liturgical calendar. While the Shenshai is the most widespread calendar among the Zoroastrians of India, the adherents of Ilm-e-Khshnoom advocate the adoption of the Fasli calendar. From the 1980âs, Parsis who follow the teachings of Shroff can be found in US and Canada as well as in Australia.",1907,2020,1027,755,Mariano Errichiello,43,Quinn Clark,2020-07-21 19:18:47.807 +0200,2022-11-08 23:39:07.452 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),1.0175446664458069e-29,1.0040974014472176e-35,0.9999991086873485,6.342548703615524e-15,6.155397417341934e-26,4.5462168679822235e-60,6.246411876145453e-17,4.494077116981701e-39,8.913126450981607e-07
863,Orphism,43,Religious Group (v6),"Introduction:
Till this day, there is an aura of mystery surrounding the Orphic cult, or what some call Orphism. Based on the mythological figure Orpheus, who descends into the Underworld in order to save his wife Eurydice only to fail. Orpheus is touted for his musical abilities that charms both goddesses, such as Persephone and animals. His musical prowess becomes divine and in the Classical period of the 5th century BC begins to acquire the reputation of establishing a cult according to Plato, Euripides, and, perhaps, Pindar.

Not much is known about the Orphic Cult itself save the textual evidence from the Deverni Papyrus, the golden lamellae, and the so-called âOrphic hymnsâ. Because of its mysterious nature, scholars come into passionate disagreement over the years: 1) some, such as Edmonds, deny the existence of an Orphic cult, 2) others, like Graf and Johnston, claim that âOrphic/Orphismâ was used anytime the ancients wanted to demarcate as something strange, and non-tradition, 3) those who argue on behalf of an Orphic Cult. In recent years, however, it seems that 4) must scholars support the idea of an Orphic movement that spread throughout the Mediterranean in the peripheries of the Greek world, especially in Magna Graecia: the Greek colonies in Italy.

The flourishing of Orphism in Magna Graecia coincides with the advent and proliferation of Pythagoreanism during the same period of the 6th and 5th centuries BC. This has led scholars to notice similarities in the two movements, such as vegetarianism, because both sects believed that the soul could reincarnate into animals, a focus on purity especially in the material world, and a conception of a happy afterlife if the soul remains pure. One wonders whether Magna Graecia and the Italic-Greeks had a knack for eschatological ideas during the 6th and 5th centuries BC, whereas their mainland counterparts would have to wait until the Classical period 5th and 4th for these ideas to travel eastward. If this is right, one can begin to see cracks on old standing narratives: 1) a monolithic idea of Greekness and 2) the perpetual misunderstanding that Greek influence is a one way street where Hellenism is always the influencer and never the influenced. 

Orphic Movement
Returning to the Orphic cult, the little evidence that we possess seems to indicate a scattered cult with shared ideas in cosmology found in the Derveni Papyrus and some golden lamellae and the instructions for the soul in afterlife, found in the golden lamellae that were buried with the deceased. These primary ancient documents detail strange myths and an Underworld that is unfamiliar to anyone who has read the traditional tales of Hesiod and Homer, especially the centerfold position that Dionysius holds in the âTheogony of Orpheusâ and the Zagreus myth scattered in the Derveni Papyrus and later in the âDionysiacaâ of the 5th century AD Neoplatonist Nonnos.

Cosmology:
The Theogeny of Orpheus gives the reader a sense of departure of the Orphic cosmology from the Hesiodic one. Time produces an egg with a serpent enwrapped around it. From the egg is born Protogonos the first god who begins to fashion the universe in a way similar to that of Hesiodâs gods: sexually.  From there on come the other gods: Night followed by Ouranous who produces the Titans and from them come the Zeus and Olympians. Zeus then swallows Protogonos and keeps him in his belly in order to recreate the universe. It seems in some places that Protogonos and Zeus become linked in one god. The closest resemblance here is the birth of Athena after Zeus swallowed her mother Metis. The elision of Zeus and Protogonos can be most easily explained by the need to square competing supreme gods by the Orphic cult. Other scholars also posit that the movement had two supreme deities, but it is not quite clear what is the relationship between the two. Nevertheless, by the early Christian era and Late Antiquity, it is Zeus who claims the titles of âfirstâ, âlastâ, âkingâ, âfateâ, âmiddleâ, and âheadâ. Whatever the case may be, Orphic cosmology, like its traditional Greek counterpart, contains an ordered universe with Zeus in charge whose intervention in the affairs of the world are not quite clear. Yet, one should never consider Orphic cosmology as exclusive and there is the possibility that the myths of the Odyssey and Iliad were integrated somehow in Orphic cosmology.

One last important medication to the mythic cosmology commonly found in Hesiod is the emphasis of Dionysius role in the myth of Zagreus (Dionysius). According to the Derveni Papyrus commentator and Nonnos, Zeus impregnates Persephone (not Semele), and the latter gives birth to Dionysius. Then, because Zeus marks Dionysius as his successor, the Titans now jealous lure the child Dionysius away with toys, kill Dionysius, and then eat him. In vengeance, and with his furious lightning bolt, Zeus smolders the Titans into black ash whence mankind arises. Then, Zeus and Athena resurrect Dionysius, who either succeeds him in some versions or co-rules with Zeus. As with Protogonos, one can see either a merging of Zeus and Dionysius in the Orphic tradition that represents the unification of Bacchic ritual with more common elements of Greek religion. 

Finally, the most striking departure from the Hesiodic and Homeric traditions is the origin of man from the ashes of the Titans. Some lamellae and a fragment of Pindar seem to allude to this myth. Pindar states, as Rose argues, that man has an ancient grief of the blood guilt in the murder of Persephoneâs son. This has led many to believe that the Orphic cult had an idea of soteriology where mankind needs to live a pure life in order to redeem himself so that he may dwell among the heroes as some lamellae state. Pace Rose et alia, Edmonds points to the fact that the only complete version of the Zagreus myth occurs in Nonnos, almost a full millennia after the Derveni Papyrus and that it cannot represent what occurred in the 6th-4th centuries BC. The idea of a fallen man, as Edmonds argue, comes from Christianity in two ways: 1) Nonnos is alive in a period when Christianity is now the official religion of the Roman Empire and many Neoplatonists, like Nonnos and Porphyry, are engage in polemics against Christian intellectuals, and 2) the over-emphasis of the use of texts such as the Derveni Papyrus and the golden lamellae in the 19th-20th century comes from the Protestant-Catholic debate on early Christianity, where Protestants focused on the importance of texts as a concept in order to defend Sola Scriptura. 

Whatever happened on the ground in the ancient period, the little evidence shows that there was a Zagreus myth in the air and that the Orphic cult, as expressed in the Lamellae, focus on bodily purification in order to live among mythological heroes. Whether this purification depends upon the Zagreus myth, I shall leave in mystery and allow the reader to riddle out the hidden secrets of the Orphic as we now turn to the Orphic ritual. 

Ritual:
Apart from what is said in Plato and Euripidesâ âHippolytusâ, Orphic ritual at least had an initiation process that included hymns (whether or not the published âOrphic Hymnsâ were the ones used in the ritual itself). Once the ritual was concluded, the initiate was expected to live a pure life. They could not eat animals since that would require ingesting the soul of a tentative human who reincarnated in the animal. This purity also required the initiate to abstain from murder, since blood in the ancient Greek religion was a source of bodily pollution. Apart from these details, we remain in the dark as to the common ethical behavior of the initiated. Perhaps, Pythagoreanism could serve as a point of comparison, but to generalize too much from one obscure movement Pythagoreanism to another is not conducive. 

At the initiatedâs death, a golden âleafâ was placed with the deceased. On this plaque, there are instructions for the soul of the deceased on what he or she do when she is in the Underworld. One group of texts states that the deceased should supplicate the divinities of the Underworld, especially Persephone, in order to pass into the abode of the pure. Another group gives fuller and rather strange instructions. The soul of the initiated must avoid the spring near the white cypress tree and venture to another cold spring that contains the waters of memory. These waters, however, are guarded and the deceased must state that, though he is a child of Earth and Heaven, he is one of heavenly stalk. Once the guards allow him or her, the deceased drinks from the waters and then passes to dwell among the heroes. Some other lamellae add other details. For example, the lamella from Hipponium adds a verb that suggests Bacchic ritual of revelry and madness. Another tablet adds the line âa kid I have fallen in milkâ. Torjussen has argued that milk represents the initiation ritual since milk represents the Mily Way as early as the 7th century BC and also represents the purity of the soul. Thus, the righteous souls would live in the Milky Way whereas the unrighteous in the lands of Hades. Pace Torjusses, this last idea is also common to the Neoplatonists starting with Numenius and a degree of skepticism as to what the milk represents is warranted. 

To conclude some final remarks on Orphism, the mystery cult and its adherents tended to display an asceticism that might have depended on their cosmological and eschatological views: perhaps, a corrupt mankind born from the ashes of the Titans can be redeemed through purification. If this is right, the Orphic cult has a remarkable tenure of a millennia that survives into the early Christian period and Late Antiquity. In fact, Lactantius, one of the earliest Church fathers, mentions that Orpheus was close to the eternal truth when he posited a god creator (Protogonos). Many Neoplatonists of the 4th-5th centuries, beginning with Numenius, co-opted Pythagorean-Orphic ideas into their Platonist thought. Moreover, some scholars have argued that the iconography of the Good Shepherd found in early Christian Roman sarcophagi were coopted from the shepherd motif found in Orphic and Bacchic ritual. In time, however, as the historical record shows, both Christianity and Neoplatonism endured into the Middle Ages, whereas Orphism did not.",-550,450,132,733,Juan Dopico,18,Robyn Walsh,2020-07-21 20:01:04.299 +0200,2022-11-30 17:42:19.465 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.8647822163749366,7.090705706722973e-13,2.8227561155402357e-25,1.2495811557796318e-12,0.004241402111717945,0.049197195715453404,0.08177918579591809,1.536130601453976e-14,3.681390933870619e-18
867,Nyingma Treasure,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Nyingma Treasure tradition is a subgroup of practitioners within the Nyingma (Rnying ma) School of Tibetan Buddhism. Its scripture authority comes from revealed texts (with varying methods for revelation), rather than translated or transmitted texts from India.


In contrast to the Sarma (Gsar ma, literally the âNew Schoolâ) traditions, who draw their scriptural authority from newly transmitted and translated scriptures from India, the Nyingma School (literally the âOld Schoolâ) traces its religious pedigree back to the time of the Tibetan Empire. There are two modes of scriptural transmissions for the Nyingma School: (1) the distant lineage of transmitted precepts (bkaâ ma); and (2) the close lineages of Treasures (gter ma). The distant lineage of transmitted precepts refers to (oral) teachings that can be traced back to the Buddhaâs time through an unbroken lineage; while the close lineages of Treasures refer to revealed teachings that are said to be concealed by enlightened masters of the past and assigned to be rediscovered by predestined Treasure revealers (gter ston) in the future.


The Treasures come in two forms, materials objects and sacred texts. The origins of these Treasures are usually associated with Buddhist masters from India who visited Tibet in the past. The most important teacher associated with the Treasure tradition is the Indian tantric master Padmasambhava (Vimalamitra is also a popular choice at this time, although his important diminished compared to Padmasambhava in later times). He is said to have visited Tibet at the request of the Buddhist king Tri Songdetsen (Khri srong lde btsan), where he subjugated many local deities and spirits, converted them to protectors of Buddhism, defeated the opposing Bon masters, commissioned many translations of Buddhist texts, and left behind Treasure teachings all over Tibet. Yeshe Tsogyel, his main consort and disciple, is said to be responsible for the concealment of these teachings, entrusting them to local guardian deities, and ensuring their successful delivery to future Treasure revealers.


The process of Treasure discovery usually begins with a vision or a dream of prophecy. The Treasure revealer will be told in the vision or dream about the place, time, and method for extracting the Treasure. After a successful retrieval, s/he will usually receive a Treasure casket and/or a yellow scroll with encoded letters or khandroma scripts (mkhaâ âgro ma, or á¸ÄkinÄ«). Because of this association, as well as her special talent with language and words, the goddess khandroma, in her divine or human form, is commonly summoned in the process of decoding the Treasure scroll. After decoding, the Treasure revealer then records the teaching in writing and form a Treasure cycle. A standard cycle of Treasure teaching usually includes multiple genres, starting with a certificate authenticating the teaching, and ranging from ritual manuals, oral instructions, life stories, religious histories, prophecies, and doctrinal exegeses.",1200,1500,96,752,Jue Liang,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-22 01:43:23.881 +0200,2020-08-14 16:56:51.986 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.9988547967697157,6.961209962129543e-21,1.0792036093496658e-14,0.0008697508250789511,2.9043744979236044e-17,2.4928281766948715e-25,3.6900408967133076e-13,0.00027545240482294863,2.552475410432481e-15
869,Sichuan Esoteric Buddhist Cult,43,Religious Group (v6),"Shortly after Emperor Wu æ­¦ of the Tang dynasty initiated the Huichang ææ Suppression of Buddhism in 842 CE, Tang Esoteric Buddhism lost the imperial patronage and fell into decline. While esoteric Buddhist activities suffered severely in the capital Changan, it was believed that a lay Buddhist named Liu Juzhi æ³å±ç´ (855-907, also known as Liu Benzun æ³æ¬å°, âthe principle master Liuâ) received the transmission of esoteric Buddhist teachings, especially the incantations efficacious in curing diseases and eliminating evil spirits, and devoted himself to spreading his teachings in Yizhou çå· (nowadays Chengdu æé½) and surrounding areas. 

Grottoes related to Liu Benzunâs esoteric Buddhist cult were built in Anyue å®å²³ and Dazu å¤§è¶³ county in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Both the Pilu æ¯ç§ (Vairocana Buddha) Cave in Anyue and the niche 21 of Mt. Baoding å¯¶é  (Summit of Jewels) in Dazu preserved large-scale tableaux depicting ten scenes of Liu Benzunâs self-mutilation. Chinese scholars argue that the tableau in Dazu was produced later than the tableau in Anyue as a remodeled version of it. Mt. Baoding, as a prominent part of the Dazu Rock Carvings (listed as a World Heritage Site), was famous for a series of grottoes presenting varied themes of Buddhist teachings. According to the entry from a Southern Song geographical guidebook and the inscriptions from two Southern Song steles preserved at Mt. Baoding, these grottoes belonged to Buddhist practitioner Zhao Zhifeng's è¶æºé³³ (1159-1249) carving project, which aimed at propagating esoteric Buddhist teachings inherited from his patriarch Liu Benzun as well as the secular value of filial piety. Evidence of this carving projectâs emphasis on the esoteric tradition can be found as the inscription in niche 21, which writes Liu Benzunâs honorific title as âthe supreme master of Tang Esoteric Buddhism.â 

Due to the lack of extant historical texts, the study of Liu Benzunâs esoteric Buddhist cult was limited to the analyses of stele inscriptions, sculptures, and stone relief carvings. Most scholars hold the opinion that, contrary to the statement claimed in his biographical inscriptions, Liu Benzun did not obtain an orthodox transmission from Tang esoteric Buddhist patriachs. Moreover, scholars remain skeptical about the account of Zhao Zhifengâs studying at the major practice hall of Liuâs teachings. Based on interpretations of the carvings at Mt. Baoding, scholars suggest that Zhao established this site as a cultic center where the cult of the deified lay Buddhist Liu Benzun was integrated with Mahayana Buddhist traditions, Confucianism, and Daoism. 

The stone inscription and tableaux preserved in Anyue and Dazu areas illustrated that the esoteric Buddhist cult prevalent in the Sichuan area from Late Tang to Southern Song was a regional Buddhist cult with distinctive doctrines and practices which embodied an amalgamation of Tang esoteric tradition, exoteric Buddhist traditions, and local beliefs.",855,1279,1031,730,Yi Liu,45,Matthew Hamm,2020-07-22 11:02:32.389 +0200,2020-08-02 13:00:08.553 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.7082904612444211,0.014814934233563776,0.14024234990171472,0.08977041260465726,0.046881842013735214,1.0342479997159037e-12,8.106756655835647e-13,6.304036752197983e-14,1.1533770704236223e-17
871,Spiritualism,43,Religious Group (v6),"In 1948, young sisters Maggie and Katy Fox reported to their family that not only was there a spirit living in their house, but theyâd learned how to communicate with it. Friends and neighbors around their house in upstate New York came to bear witness to the spiritâs ârappings,â the girls quickly became celebrity mediums, and the Spiritualist movement took off. 

Spiritualism coalesced around a belief that the dead live on in a âspirit worldâ separated from the world of the living by a thin veil. In this spirit world, individual identities and personal connections persist, and the dead can continue to grow and to spiritually mature. The movementâs central practices include seances, trance lectures, mediumship, healings, and other modes of communication with the spirit world. The commercial success of events like public seances and products like Ouija boards have blurred the line between Spiritualism-as-entertainment and Spiritualism-as-religion from the traditionâs earliest days. Spiritualists also eschew central organization and have no formal markers of religious affiliation, so no precise figures exist for affiliation. However, scholars estimate that anywhere from 3 to 11 million Americans were participating in Spiritualism at the movementâs peak in the late 19th century.

Drawing on previous religious traditions like Mesmerism, Swedenborgianism, and New Thought, Spiritualism followed in the iconoclastic footprints of other new religious movements that came out of the Burned-over District in the 19th century. Early Spiritualists denounced dogmatism and sectarianism of organized religion, and spoke out against the Calvinist notion that humankind is innately sinful. In turn, most Christian churches explicitly disavowed Spiritualism, warning congregants that it was a fraud â or worse, that it was witchcraft. Still, many Spiritualists have historically been practicing Christians, and some churches (especially Quaker, Universalist, and Unitarian churches) have either tacitly or even explicitly welcomed Spiritualism as an outgrowth of Christian practice. Some Spiritualists founded churches of their own, and several associations of Spiritualist Churches exist to this day. The movement also had strong ties to social reform movements, including abolition and womenâs suffrage.

Spiritualist practice was originally centered in the northern U.S., with another notable pocket of popularity around New Orleans. English-language periodicals, Spiritualist camps, and travelling mediums also connected American practitioners to a transnational network that grew to extend through Great Britain, parts of Canada. The movement was also briefly in vogue throughout continental Europe. Although Spiritualism experienced another surge of popularity in the wake of WWI, it has never regained its 19th century status in the religious and cultural mainstream.",1848,2020,1033,738,Joanna Smith,5,Courtney Fitzsimmons,2020-07-22 16:44:51.207 +0200,2023-04-23 02:56:59.575 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),3.411314637106288e-18,1.2285667431519146e-15,0.9998471071443633,9.623850936476852e-14,2.45688419523137e-13,2.6460304116680563e-47,2.7140589550624503e-16,3.273079366838072e-26,0.00015289285529337664
873,The Branch Davidians,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Branch Davidians were a millenarian sect active in the United States from 1960âs through 1993. The group developed out of a Seventh-Day Adventist offshoot called the Davidian Adventists, which believed itself to be the pure remnant of a now-global Adventist church that had grown lax and sinful. In contrast to Adventist understandings that the Kingdom of God would come about through a spiritual transformation of the world, the Davidians taught that the Kingdom of God would be physically established by a second Christ in the modern-day land of Palestine. In 1935, the Davidians moved to a large farm in Waco, TX, from which they proselytized (mainly by mail) about the imminent return of Christ.

After the death of Davidian founder Victor Houteff in 1955 (and after Christ failed to materialize on the day that Houteffâs widow predicted in 1959) the group began to splinter, and by the early 1960âs it re-coalesced around members Ben and Lois Roden, who both eventually assumed the mantle as prophets and renamed the group the âBranch Davidians.â In 1981, a recent convert named Vernon Howell began to stake claims to the prophetic role that Lois Roden still held. Out of the power struggles that followed Rodenâs death in the mid-1980s, Howell emerged the clear leader of the Branch Davidians. After a trip to Israel where he claimed to have had a vision of angelic forces, in 1990 he legally changed his name to David Koresh and began to teach that he was a second Christ sent to complete the mission that Jesus had started by ushering in the end of days. 

Koresh and a group of over 100 followers lived communally at Mount Carmel, their compound in Waco, Texas. There, members participated in lengthy daily Bible studies led by Koresh. They believed that he had been sent by God to reveal the full meaning of the Christian Bible, and in particular, to unfold the narrative of the imminent apocalypse. They believed the apocalypse would be triggered by a conflict between the Branch Davidians and the forces of âBabylonâ that would take place in the land of Palestine at some point in the near future. Aiming to purify themselves in preparation for the end of days, they sought to live as a perfect community; they came to see themselves as a divine family, with adults spiritually married to Koresh and all of the children spiritually his â and many of them biologically his own, as well. 

In the spring of 1993, when federal agents â legally spurred by an arrest warrant for Koresh on weapons charges, but also deeply motivated by fears driven by the anti-cult movement â began a violent siege on the groupâs compound. After 51 days, the compound went up in flames, killing 76 Branch Davidians, including Koresh. The movement was effectively ended, though some believers survived, and though some other groups have risen up to claim the name of Branch Davidian. Some elements of life at Mount Carmel remain contested to this day, with conflicting reports from members and disaffected ex-members emerging during and after the siege.",1962,1993,1035,738,Joanna Smith,5,Courtney Fitzsimmons,2020-07-22 17:05:48.732 +0200,2020-08-16 15:07:18.828 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.0003036857640932551,0.026341806773536147,1.778897188823537e-15,0.033433137816339595,0.00013187420492354575,2.2090623598624163e-12,6.549260936274293e-05,0.9113341694201208,0.02838983340941306
879,Free Methodist Church,43,Religious Group (v6),"A Christian denomination in the Wesleyan/Holiness tradition which broke away from the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1860. The major issue leading to the split concerned disagreements over slavery. The Methodist Episcopal Church (MEC) still had many slaveholders after the schism in 1844 saw the creation of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South (MEC, S). Official church policy recognized slaveholding as sin, but in practice had accepted the reality of the practice and attempted to justify it under several theories (e.g., paternalism toward slaves, keeping slaveholders in the church). Roberts and other abolitionists saw this compromise as a violation of the ethical precepts of Christianity and their Wesleyan heritage (John Wesley had was an abolitionist in Britain). However, the direct cause of the formation of the Free Methodist Church was a series of political maneuvers in Robertsâ home conference which saw Roberts and several other pastors expelled from the MEC. There is a split in the scholarship as to whether Robertâs abolitionist views lead to the political maneuvers or was merely one view amongst many that angered important parts of the churchâs hierarchy (see Snyder, 406-7).
	Upon establishing the new denomination, Roberts ended the practice of âpew rentingâ by which wealthy individuals could ârentâ a pew in church with better visibility, both for and of themselves. He also ended instrumental music in churches, not on grounds against such music, but against the practice of paying trained musicians out of the churchâs funds which could have gone to other needs. Like much of the holiness tradition of the nineteenth century, simplicity was a virtue.
Currently, the church has less than 100,000 members in the United States but totals more the one million total members worldwide. It is episcopal in organization with three bishops, each based in the USA. The church is connected to five universities in the United States: Roberts Wesleyan in New York, Spring Arbor in Michigan, Greenville University in Illinois, Central Christian University in Kansas, and Seattle Pacific in Washington; and another four internationally. The church is also affiliated with several non-denominational schools, including Azusa Pacific in California, and Asbury University and Asbury Theological Seminary in Kentucky.
The Free Methodist Church fits nearly all definitions of âevangelicalâ and members are generally theologically and politically conservative (in the USA) though the latter has more diversity among congregants. Among the other Wesleyan related churches, Free Methodists are most similar in theology to the Church of the Nazarene and the conservative (sometimes called âtraditionalâ) wing of the United Methodist Church due to their teachings of both progressive and instantaneous sanctification at some point after justification. This experience has many names from different theologians but most use the terms âEntire Sanctificationâ or âSecond work of graceâ to describe it.",1860,2020,1103,773,Steven Lane,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-22 19:27:44.688 +0200,2020-08-11 17:21:08.721 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),1.1566194132941026e-05,0.04823464501674903,3.915087721829286e-15,0.024314994566629777,0.0013906369500424481,1.4102099349190877e-12,5.062293243305799e-06,0.834907626491756,0.09113546848603242
880,Egyptian Salafism (inluding North Africa and West Asia),43,Religious Group (v6),"Salafis' main aim is to practice Islam as the ""pious predecessors"" (al-salaf al-salih) of Prophet Muhammad practiced it. This means overlooking or even shunning any practice or belief that is deemed an accretion to what the earliest Muslims did or believed. Salafi thought is often linked to the Saudi Arabian thinker Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab, but scholarship suggests that the movement has roots in 19th century Islamic Egyptian thought. Traces of Salafi practice and belief can be found worldwide.
The main sources of Sunni practice and beliefs are the Qur'an, the normative example of the Prophet Muhammad (sunna) and the lifestyle of the early generation of Muslims. 
The intellectual roots of the movement lie in the thought of the eighteenth-century Arabian thinker Muhammad ibn âAbd al-Wahhab (d.1791). A man of little traditional religious training, Ibn âAbd al-Wahhab nonetheless sought to rectify what he perceived to be the unlawful accretions to Islam and Islamic practice that he observed in his people in what is today Saudi Arabia. He wanted to eliminate the practice of venerating saints and sought to place tawhid (the belief in Allahâs oneness) at the center of Islamic belief. Any actions that were deemed antithetical to this or were seen as an innovation (bidâa) were to be condemned and eliminated.  
But the term Salafism is a tricky one. Scholars like Henri LauziÃ¨re explain that there are two usages for the term. Although modernists religious scholars like Jamal al-Din al-Afghani (d. 1897) and Muhammad âAbduh (d. 1905) did not actually call themselves Salafi, they are often credited with having spearheaded the movement in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. These âModernist Salafis,â as LauziÃ¨re calls them, strove to ârearticulate their religion in terms that were more relevant to contemporary realities and more intelligible and appealing to the rational minds of the educated elite.â  Like Ibn âAbd al-Wahhab, they viewed the immediate followers of Prophet Muhammad (al-salaf al-salih) as the exemplars of pious Islam. They were thus committed to the example of the salaf and to the text but did not believe that this should be a hindrance on their ability to adapt aspects of the law to help the Muslim world (umma) move forward in the ever-changing, modernizing world.  
âPurist Salafis,â on the other hand, are exclusionary in that they view that theirs is the only form of Islam that could lead to salvation. It is the pure Islam of the salaf, âunsullied by any innovation, deviation or accretion and uncontaminated by exogenous influencesâ that should be followed by all.  LauziÃ¨re argues, however, that, in the beginning, Purist Salafism did not completely reject religious compromise. Between the 1920s and the 1950s, leading Salafi activists âmodified their understanding of Islamic reformâ¦mainly to accommodate political considerations and to increase the likelihood of achieving political independence from colonial powers.â  They thus constructed a rigorist form of Salafism that emphasized purity but sought to unite and gain a following throughout the Muslim world.  Post-independence, however, Purist Salafis no longer had to downplay their exclusionary vision of Islam. This form of Salafism âresponded to the challenge of modernity by escaping to the secure haven of the text, but it treated rational moral insight as fundamentally corrupting of the purity of the Islamic message,â stunting its growth and ability to respond to modern needs and inquiries.  Despite this, it was the purists who continued to thrive, while modernists, having played their part during the colonial period, fell by the wayside.
States like Saudi Arabia sought to spread this brand of Salafism globally since the 1970s through preachers, funding Salafi mosques and promoting and distributing Salafi texts worldwide.",1870,2015,1038,774,Nareman Amin,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-22 20:54:20.322 +0200,2020-08-03 07:44:07.459 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),2.680763260699231e-06,0.0926087198223758,3.0210990852211815e-15,0.0997793426220821,0.00017221152292652857,4.3408221415548064e-13,2.714522506410461e-06,0.5891334337196175,0.21830089702679392
882,Orphism,43,Religious Group (v6),"Orphism was a mystery cult of enduring perplexity: it is of obscure origin, vague doctrine, diverse practice, loose membership, and indeterminate extinction.  Its sole fixture is the centrality of a canon of largely eschatological texts attributed by believers to the mythical Orpheus.  The cult is attested textually in the mid 5th c. B.C. and  archaeologically from the 4th c. B.C. to the 3rd A.D.  The most extensive writings about it were by non-practitioners, principally Neoplatonists and Christians, writing centuries after the last archaeological evidence of its being practised.  It may have had scattered adherents into the 4th c. A.D., as evidenced by the composition of the Orphic Argonautica.  It appears not to have survived under the Christianization of the Roman Empire.

|  The very term âOrphismâ appears to be an exonym, but it is accepted as a valid in so far as there were, according to Plato, missionaries called orpheotelestai, whom he portrays as charlatans, and Orphikoi, writers of Orphic texts.  Modern scholarship on Orphism may be divided into minimalist and maximalist schools: the minimalist, predominant until the 1970âs, and represented by Willamowitz, defines Orphism as merely Orphic texts and teachers thereof, with no fixed doctrine; the maximalists, e.g. Graf and Johnston, as a community of eschatological belief coÃ¯nciding indefinitely with the cult of Dionysus, possessed of peculiar texts, rituals, initiators, initiates, and missionaries.  

  |  The core of modern knowledge of Orphism is the Orphica, a body of poems of doubtful authorship, but which believers ascribed to Orpheus (non-believers explicitly doubted the attribution), whose matter treats with a distinct theogony and exchatology.  Besides this are other texts of ritualistic nature, many shared with the Dionysian tradition.  These texts are preserved principally in the Derveni papyrus (the oldest Greek papyrus, and one of the most remarkable ever discovered), and the diverse aureae lamellae (Golden Tablets), eminent among which is the Gold Leaf from Hipponium.  They contain eighty-seven hexametric hymns, along with twenty-four rhapsodies.

|  Much of what is now taken to be Orphic doctrine was  formalized by Neoplatonic philosophers in late antiquity, such as Proclus, Olympiodorus, and Damascius, who were writing long after new Orphica had ceased to be produced.  In fact, it appears that multiple theogonies circulated among the Orphica, in the form of commentaries on the sacred texts.  Their shared features, which are at most a vague approximation of what may inaccurately be termed Orphic doctrine, suggest a belief in manâs dual nature, viz., Titanicâwicked and Olympianâgood; possibly, an original sin; almost certainly, a concern with initiation and ritual purity that would grant some form of afterlife and escape from rebirth and divine punishment.

The teletai, or rituals of initiation, are unknown.  As in contemporary mystery cults, the rites were probably known only to a specialist class.  While the mysteries revealed at initiation do not appear in ancient sources, some idea of their nature may be formed from the Orphic texts.  To judge from the opening of the Derveni papyrus, it is likely that initiation into the Orphic mysteries entailed learning the distinctive theogony presented in the literature.  Platoâs references, the Orphic Argonautica, and the Lithica (on the magical properties of certain stones) strongly suggest a belief in purificatory magic.

|  In sum, if any essence of Orphism is to be found, it is in adherentsâ belief that certain texts, mainly about theogony and eschatology, were composed by Orpheus and spoke the truth.  The interpretation of these texts, as elsewhere in Greek religion, was not a matter of fixed doctrine.",-450,425,1040,760,Marshall Buchanan,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-23 00:31:28.644 +0200,2020-07-25 04:54:35.192 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.1323622672836057,0.026664096113225854,3.257871745925027e-14,2.1417665876559394e-08,0.00025307248004426445,0.004467721238547261,0.83625282146685,2.8488687901298515e-14,3.4411489384960814e-19
883,Catholics in the People's Republic of China (PRC),43,Religious Group (v6),"This group includes all Catholics in the Peopleâs Republic of China (PRC) (i.e. mainland China, excluding Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau) from its founding in 1949 to the present. It includes believers who participate in the registered (or ""above ground"") part of the church as well as the unregistered (or ""underground"") part of the church, and those in both urban and rural locations.
In 1949, when the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) led by Chairman Mao Zedong defeated the Nationalist Party (KMT), and established the PRC, there were an estimated four million Catholics in China. Whereas the KMT government supported them and had established diplomatic relations with the Vatican, the CCP (even before 1949) had begun to persecute Catholics as agents of foreign imperialism. Broader CCP efforts to eradicate all religion in favor of Marxist atheism began in the 1950s. Fr. Beda Chang (Zhang Boda å¼ ä¼¯è¾¾), the first Catholic martyr under CCP rule, was martyred in 1951. After resisting CCP pressure, a large group of Catholics in Shanghai, including its first Chinese bishop, Ignatius Kung Pin-mei (Gong Pinmei é¾åæ¢), was arrested in 1955. 
In 1957 the government established the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association (CCPA), a government body responsible for ensuring compliance with the demand that the Church in China must be âindependentâ and self-sustaining, with no official ties to the Vatican or the Pope. A percentage of clergy accepted these demands, and formed the state-approved official, or âabove-groundâ church, while the majority of Catholics, who rejected these demands as incompatible with the Catholic faith, became known as the unofficial, or âundergroundâ Church. The CCPA began orchestrating the appointment of bishops without papal approval, which continued until 2018, when a controversial agreement between the Holy See and the PRC government was signed. Since 2018, the government has continued to pressure underground clergy to agree to a separation, or âindependenceâ from the Holy See.
During the Cultural Revolution (1966-76), all perceived political enemies of Mao were persecuted, and believers of all religions, including official and underground Christians were killed or suffered mental or physical mistreatment. After Maoâs death, official churches reopened, but still under the CCPAâs oversight. To the surprise of many, the number of Christians had grown during these silent years, and continued to expand from the 1980s to the present. Today China has an estimated 10-12 million Catholics, and many more Protestant Christians.",1949,2020,1132,777,John Lindblom,45,Matthew Hamm,2020-07-23 02:02:18.430 +0200,2021-09-29 20:35:45.217 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.001436389408412549,0.04349245456468567,2.4205253401043623e-15,0.09946488263213588,0.004850084416834748,0.6940968980955915,0.00022582137595037981,0.15643341393136986,5.557501699752987e-08
884,Sub Saharan Africa Pentecostalism,43,Religious Group (v6),"European missionaries brought Christianity to Sub Saharan Africa with the goal of converting the population of the region. They were indeed successful in that the local population took Christianism and made it their own. Hence was born African Independent Churches in the early twentieth century leading later to the Pentecostal movement. After the wave of independences from colonial rule in the 1960s, the independent churches thrived until the 1970s when the Pentecostal movement which was at that point an underground movement became full blown. It is now becoming the dominant form of Christianity in Africa attracting converts from all religions, tribal and ethnic groups, and all walks of life. 

The movement is defined by the day of Pentecost and refers to the encounter with God in the Bibleâs book of the Acts of the apostles. Pentecostals believe they receive an impartation of Godâs spirit when they confess the name of Jesus. Its main pillars are the concept of being born again, the baptism of the Holy Spirit, speaking in tongue, the divine healing, the eschatological belief of the return of Jesus Christ, and all wrapped in the concept of the full gospel. First, the concept of âborn againâ refers to a spiritual birth of an individual which in the African context connect the person to the invisible world. Second, the baptism of the Holy Spirit is a Christian concept of spiritual empowerment which is also found in African spiritual belief which gives the person a spiritual awareness and discernment. Third, the divine healing mimics African belief that a person can be supernaturally healed in opposition to modern medicine. Finally, the return of Jesus Christ is similar to African eschatological belief that there is an invisible world out there which controls the visible world.

 In fact, African cosmology assumes two worlds: one which is invisible and populated with spirits and the other which is the visible world. The interaction between the invisible and visible worlds determines humanâs faith. Pentecostals practice exorcisms where evil spirits are cast out followed with weeping, laughing, and screaming. They engage in what is known as spiritual warfare, praying, and fasting. These beliefs are ingrained in Africansâ psyche and were comfortably found in Pentecostal belief generating what is known as African Pentecostalism. It gives people a sense of self, meaning, and reconcile years of exploitation with the newfound identity. It encourages free enterprise, hard work, and self-determination.",1907,2022,1041,744,Azizou Atte-oudeyi,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-23 02:16:24.816 +0200,2022-05-08 00:54:56.460 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),2.680763260699231e-06,0.0926087198223758,3.0210990852211815e-15,0.0997793426220821,0.00017221152292652857,4.3408221415548064e-13,2.714522506410461e-06,0.5891334337196175,0.21830089702679392
885,Contemporary West African Vodun,43,Religious Group (v6),"The word Vodun means spirit in Fon and Ewe, two languages spoken in coastal Benin, Togo, and South East of Ghana. The Vodun religion is an ancestral religion common to the population living in the west African coastal corridor covering the countries mentioned above. The deities comprise of the supreme god and intermediary gods who cover different domain of life. The supreme god is known as âMawuâ, a benevolent god who has the control of the whole universe. The Vodun religion in its encounter with imported religions was associated to a demonic religion and continues to lose membership due to the westernization of the region. The contemporary Vodun religion evolves in an environment where most members practice syncretism with Islam and Christianism and most members are secretive in their allegiance to the Vodun gods.
For contemporary Vodun worshippers, the supreme god Mawu is most of the time assimilated to a monotheist god. Depending on the tribe, Mawu is either a female or a male or both. Mawu plays a moderator role in that all the intermediary godsâ actions are controlled. Below Mawu, there are seven intermediary divinities. These intermediary gods are active in everyday life and play a role in their domain. Sakpata is the god of the Earth. HÃªbioso is the thunder god. Agbe is known as the god of the sea. GÃ» represents the god of war. AgÃª is in the domain of agriculture. Finally, LÃªgba is the unpredictable god and serves as the contact point with the other gods. The ambivalence of modern worshippers is mostly visible in the rituals and sacrifices made to these gods in order to change the course of life in the changed world. Though some of Vodun priests can be found in the inner cities, the majority are located in rural area reinforcing the mystery and secrecy that surround them and their practitioners. Blood sacrifices, incantations, rituals, and the confinement of children and women in Vodun convents are some of the practices of this religion. 
Contemporary Vodun practitioners have adapted their religion to their time. With the introduction of monotheist religions, Vodun was predicted to disappear. Instead, Vodun continues to survive and has expanded to the diaspora where the Vodun has become an identity issue for former African slavesâ descendants in the Caribbean islands and the Americas. Even in contemporary West Africa, Vodun is used to affirm the African identity of its members in comparison to African Muslims and Christians.",-1960,2022,1071,744,Azizou Atte-oudeyi,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-23 04:06:38.102 +0200,2022-05-08 00:53:49.335 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.5872469212858048,5.558575887439372e-12,8.977130160477226e-16,0.004850899810756233,5.949478659380284e-15,0.0013494562131848179,0.4065527223956738,2.890149594821467e-10,1.1842809015986298e-20
886,Pushtimarg (The Path of Grace) in the UK and Gujarat,43,Religious Group (v6),"Pushtimarg was developed by Vallabhacarya (1479â1531 CE), a Vedic philosopher who emphasised the Bhagavad Purana (a religious text of Hinduism). As a form of North Indian bhakti (devotion), the sampradaya follows Krishna as Shrinathji (as well as his other forms though focus is on his childhood). Vallabhacarya did not preach a life of asceticism or renunciation. His monistic philosophy was called Shuddhadvaita (pure non-dualism) where the focus is on the Supreme Being as personal, with the potential of developing a relationship. The Pushtimarg is a householder sampradaya (community) and therefore generating wealth and having a family are important parts of Krishna's world that he created for his lila (play). 

Historically, the popularity of the bhakti movement in India was twofold; âOne the one hand, bhakti bypassed the hierarchy and ritualism of the Vedic sacrifices, monopolised by Brahmans and sponsored by their wealthy twice-born patrons, by teaching that salvation was open to all, regardless of caste, wealth, or sex, through the sincere and spontaneous expression of love for the divine. On the other hand, bhakti provided a more practicable alternative to the disciplined path followed by the renouncerâ (Bennett 1993; 2). 

The community is dispersed globally, from Mozambique to Australia. In the 1990s, Pushtimarg gurus (who are called goswamis and are descendants of Vallabhacharya)  began to travel more frequently to the diasporas around the US and Europe though this trend came relatively late compared to other forms of North Indian Krishna worship (e.g. Hare Krishna or ISKCON and the Swaminarayan faith).",1990,2020,1042,779,Anishka Gheewala Lohiya,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-23 10:10:41.156 +0200,2023-04-08 21:03:34.159 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.018142466972587742,0.4240170231066438,8.805565219168584e-15,0.012583947240165986,6.575107325732864e-15,3.023726479998301e-13,0.5452563688887482,1.9379139253968774e-07,1.4382589657461306e-13
887,Postsocialist Mongolian Shamanism,43,Religious Group (v6),"Shamanism has co-existed with Buddhism for many centuries in the Mongolian cultural region. Shamanic practices pre-date the arrival of Buddhism in the region which first became a state religion during the reign of Chinggis Khanâs grandson Khubilai Khan (r. 1260â1294). Shamanic practices and shamans have been the subject of religious oppression both by Buddhist institutions and more recently during the socialist period (1921-1990). Since the Democratic Revolution of 1989-1990, shamanism is once again allowed to be practiced in the public sphere. Since 1990 there has been a significant increase in the number of shamans and shamanic ceremonies in Mongolia. Shamanism in Mongolia differs from shamanism further north in Siberia due to the types of spirits that are channelled. Siberian shamans religious practices tend to be more animistic, channelling spirits as anthropologist Morten Pedersen puts it, âhorizontallyâ. Mongolian shamans, on the other hand, channel ancestor spirits âverticallyâ. These are human spirits located within social hierarchies. Mongolian shamans typically communicate with an allied spirit or an âongonâ who are the spirits of deceased human beings, generally within the shamanâs family. These spirits are historically located, reflecting specific genealogies. The presence of other spirits in the landscape is accepted by shamans, however it is not generally the focus of their ritual practice. Novice shamans are often found during shamanic ceremonies. Shamans can be recruited through extensive illnesses for which no cure can be found or other difficulties. Some men can become trapped in a semi-shamanic like state characterised by aggression and alcoholism which is known as âagsanâ. Once a shaman establishes a relationship with an ongon they should carry out regular ceremonies and ritual offerings to maintain the relationship. Shamanic spirits donât tend to provide eschatological or ontological answers, rather they provide advice for success in this life. Mongolian shamans enter a trance state without the use of drugs. They wear heavy clothing and a corded mask. Drumming and dancing is part of the trance state. Some shamans identify as yellow shamans as their practices include Buddhist elements.",1990,2020,1043,751,Saskia Abrahms-Kavunenko,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-23 12:49:33.516 +0200,2020-07-25 09:59:40.904 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.01261635290391844,1.2445331819413833e-09,1.8004333680217995e-11,3.0925435258118584e-08,4.869051319979921e-13,4.931057774471895e-13,0.9873836149070582,7.077301595475144e-14,1.3470890704226061e-18
888,CÃ©li DÃ© monks,43,Religious Group (v6),"Christian monastic communities of strict observance, characterised by Sabbatarianism, concerns for ritual purity, constant spiritual surveillance, and a strong sense of in-group distinctiveness in the face of other laxer communities. In general, the term refers to communities influenced by the teachings of saint MÃ¡el Ruain, abbot of Tallaght, Co. Dublin (obit 792). From Tallaght, four written sources are extant: the Old Irish Penitential, the Martyrology of Tallaght, the Martyrology of Ãengus, the Stowe Missal and possibly a hymn in honour of Saint Michael. Additionally, it is likely the Old Irish Table of Penitential Commutations emerged from Tallaght as well, as a complement to the Penitential. From Terryglass (Co. Tipperry), a community headed by MÃ¡el Ruainâs disciple MÃ¡el DÃ­thruib, is extant the so-called âTallaght Memoirâ (in three recensions: the âMonastery of Tallaght,â the Rule of the CÃ©li DÃ©, and the Teaching of MÃ¡el Ruain). An array of other sources may have been influenced by or relevant to the CÃ©li DÃ© movement (especially, the poems of Blathmac Mac Con Brettan and the Rule of Fothad).   It is unclear whether the different settlements were united in a sort of monastic federation or were independent bodies sharing a common spirituality. The number of the communities is also unclear: the membership of Terryglass is quite certain, as are those of the monastic houses mentioned in the ""Lucht Ãentad MaÃ­le Ruain"" (in Leinster and East Munster). The term CÃ©le DÃ© (while consolidated in academia) is somewhat misleading, as it was employed by religious individuals without MÃ¡el Ruain's tradition too. Apparently, they called themselves ""maic bethad"" (Sons of Life) more often than ""CÃ©li DÃ©"" (Clients or Companions of God). The group was constituted by monks (both ordained and not), nuns, para-monastic married tenants and at least some high-ranking members of the warrior aristocracy (such as Fedelmid mac Crimthainn, who became king of Cashel and over-king of Munster in the ninth century). The CÃ©li DÃ© were characterised by their high regard for the Old Testament, which was expressed in their strict Sabbatarianism and their concern for ritual purity (sexual, alimentary and death-related taboos). They also enforced a complex and all-encompassing system of spiritual surveillance through detailed and frequent confession, called âanmchairdesâ (soul-friendship). The CÃ©le DÃ© have been studied quite deeply in the past centuries (mostly by Reeves, Hughes, OâDwyer and Etchingham in the past). The most recent and throrough monograph is Westley Follettâs âCÃ©li DÃ© in Irelandâ (2007).",780,900,1044,749,Exequiel Monge Allen,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-23 17:45:24.016 +0200,2020-07-25 20:29:57.291 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.05706096462229355,0.21917846826891912,3.0051757112322397e-14,0.2951474364687512,0.0018605533426891295,0.024134728589559305,0.39751776386212795,0.005100059153050163,2.569257962476058e-08
891,Peruvian Mormons,43,Religious Group (v6),"Peruvian Mormons identify as members of the largest sect of Mormonism, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. They identify as Peruvian either because they were born in Peru or because one or more of their parents or grandparents were. Peru is a highly diasporic nation, and though most Peruvian Mormons live in Peru, many live in the U.S. state of Utah where their church is headquartered. There may be Peruvians who identify as members of sects of Mormonism other than The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, however, none of the participants in the principal anthropological study from whence this data set emerges identify with these sects nor do they know of any Peruvians who do. Importantly, most Peruvian Mormons do not identify as âPeruvian Mormons.â This is partially because their church, on August 16, 2018, expressly directed its membership to eschew the âMormonâ moniker from self-identification, but mostly because the general membership of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints desires to be seen as a global fellowship, not as a set of nationally situated religions with local, syncretic practices. Designating Mormons who happen to also be Peruvian, âPeruvian Mormonsâ is part of a theoretical intervention that separates the Mormonism happening among Peruvian Mormons in Peru and Utah from the sorts of Mormonism happening among the people Peruvians call ""Anglos"" in order to highlight the unique challenges Peruvians face in navigating a decidedly non-Peruvian organization that was founded upon early colonial U.S. (Anglo) conceptions of race and kinship.",1956,2020,1047,783,Jason Palmer,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-23 22:09:02.836 +0200,2022-11-08 23:40:09.536 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.026001336956603786,0.03206603461124715,1.596204901968532e-15,3.1404398341994684e-10,7.687502416256281e-17,2.9597375838432466e-15,0.9419326281181005,5.068517651017677e-20,3.4334001781264735e-25
892,Charismatic Renewal Movement in Christianity - Second Wave Pentecostalism,43,Religious Group (v6),"For the first six decades of the 20th Century, Pentecostalism was viewed with skepticism and often outright dismissed by other denominations of Christianity. Many Christians believed Pentecostals to chaotic and disorderly. Pentecostal practices of speaking in tongues, their beliefs in divine healing and prophecy, and their unorganized and noisy prayer gatherings ostracized them from other established Protestant traditions believed to be more orderly and respectable. They were seen as a fringe group that stood outside of the traditions of mainline and evangelical branches of the larger Protestant community.  

However, Pentecostalism and a majority of the Christian communities in the United States would undergo a massive shift as Pentecostal theology and practices burst into the âorderlyâ worlds of mainline denominations and swept across denominational boundaries beginning in 1960.  In a small Episcopalian perish in Van Nuys, CA in April 1960, the charismatic renewal found its genesis when Reverend Dennis Bennett shared his experience of being baptized in the Spirit and speaking in tongues. His announcement angered his congregation and he was asked to resign shortly after sharing his experiences. 

Despite the parishioners of St. Markâs Episcopal Church being told to not speak about what Reverend Bennett shared about, one parishioner was not going to be quiet. Jean Stone was a parishioner who began a media campaign to chronicle and share about Reverend Bennettâs experience.  Stone got Time Magazine and Newsweek to write articles about the renewal movement and Bennett became the defacto face of the Charismatic Renewal movement in the United States. As Bennettâs story spread throughout the country, other clergy from mainline Protestant denominations began to share about their experiences of being baptized in the Holy Spirit. Methodists, Lutherans, Baptists, Presbyterians, Anglicans, Mennonites, Roman Catholics, and others began to open up about their Pentecostal experience and many began to practice speaking in tongues, prophesying, healing, and deliverance.

Although there is an overlap between some of the beliefs between Pentecostals and Charismatics, there are some key differences. Both groups believe in the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, which is an experience that often takes place after conversion (although some adherents experience the Baptism of the Holy Spirit at their conversion). A key difference is the evidence of being baptized in the Holy Spirit. Pentecostals believe that a person must speak in tongues in order to demonstrate that they have been baptized in the Spirit. Charismatics claim that although many people do speak in tongues as their first sign, it is not the only sign that accompanies being baptized in the Holy Spirit. Any manifestations of the gifts of the Holy Spirit outlined in the New Testament are recognized by Charismatics as being baptized in the Spirit.  

The Charismatic Renewal Movement validated Historical Pentecostal churches and movements as part of the American Christian landscape. Prior to the movement, Mainline and Protestant denominations viewed Pentecostalism with disdain and were weary of their theology and practices. However, the media coverage of Reverend Dennis Bennettâs experiences in California in 1960, as well as the rise in denominational clergy sharing about their own experiences of being baptized in the Holy Spirit, led mainline denominational leaders were to address the Charismatic renewal movements taking place in their churches.  Most of these denominations ultimately accepted Charismatic adherents as part of their tradition. Other denominations left their position on the charismatic renewal movement open without rejecting the movement outright.",1960,2020,1018,762,Nathan Womack,5,Courtney Fitzsimmons,2020-07-24 00:12:00.075 +0200,2020-08-11 00:30:30.510 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.0003036857640932551,0.026341806773536147,1.778897188823537e-15,0.033433137816339595,0.00013187420492354575,2.2090623598624163e-12,6.549260936274293e-05,0.9113341694201208,0.02838983340941306
893,Sethian Gnostic,43,Religious Group (v6),"Sethian gnostics â also referred to by scholars as âclassic gnosticsâ or simply âthe gnosticsâ â represent a sect within early Christianity that existed from the second through the fourth century CE. Most of what we know about this group derives from the discovery of the Nag Hammadi collection of Coptic manuscripts, which dates to around 350 CE, but this information is supplemented by various heresiological writings by early proto-orthodox theologians, most significantly Irenaeus, who wrote around 180 CE. The name Sethian is applied to the sect by modern scholars because of its self-identification with the biblical Seth, son of Adam. âGnosticsâ comes from the Greek word gnÅstikoi (roughly, âthose who knowâ), which some scholars consider to be a label the Sethians applied to themselves.

Social information about the Sethians must be inferred from the textual evidence, which contains a number of features used to characterize them: (1) a complex cosmogonic myth based in part on a creative revision of Genesis and Platoâs Timaeus, (2) a strong sense of group identity and in-group language as the âseed (or offspring) of Seth,â and (3) a ritual of baptism sometimes called a ritual of âfive seals.â Very little is known of the daily life or organizational structure of the Sethians. They shared with other Christians certain theological traditions, some scripture, and an ascetic lifestyle.

Some features of the Sethian myth include: (1) an ineffable divine first principle called the Parent or Invisible Spirit; (2) a second principle called Barbelo; (3) a series of four luminaries, also called aeons or realms, named Harmozel, Oroiael, Daveithai, and Eleleth; (4) the emanation of a number of additional aeons, the last of which is named Wisdom (Sophia in Greek); (5) a craftsman (dÄmiourgos in Greek) named Ialdabaoth, who steals divine power from his mother (Wisdom) to create the visible cosmos based on intelligible paradigms while remaining ignorant of the divinities higher than him; (6) the creation of seven, twelve, and/or 365 rulers of the material world who themselves create human beings and the remainder of the material world; (7) a dramatic struggle resulting in some of humanity being given Ialdabaothâs pilfered power as a spark of divinity; (8) these human beings are the offspring of Seth, sealed by a special baptismal ritual, while the offspring of Cain remain under the power of the ignorant demiurge and his minions. (9) Where the human Jesus appears in the versions of this myth, he is variously identified with a preexistent Anointed One (Greek christos), a preexistent Word (Greek logos), a preexistent Seth, or Barbelo.
Individual Sethian texts contain some but not all of the elements of this myth. As such, the category âSethian Gnosticâ can be understood as a polythetic class, i.e. it contains a number of non-essential characteristics but lacks an essential (sine qua non) characteristic. Some scholars, notably John D. Turner, have reconstructed a âliterary historyâ of these texts based on textual developments within this mythic framework. The complex emanation scheme of the Sethian myth reveals an involvement with the Middle Platonic philosophical speculation of the time, which has been compared to such thinkers as Philo of Alexandria and Numenius of Apamea.",100,400,1048,778,Brian Alt,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-24 00:29:36.567 +0200,2020-07-24 00:29:36.567 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),1.0404681923077372e-40,1.0451782130634045e-46,0.999999999999998,2.038253544191875e-15,6.389934946145818e-37,3.291097499781449e-71,3.441063511751295e-18,3.3086100127936524e-50,1.318398175027537e-17
894,Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches,43,Religious Group (v6),"The UFMCC (often shortened to âMCCâ) is a Christian denomination that was founded first and foremost as a ministry for LGBTQ people. Reverend Troy Perry, who grew up in rural Florida and worked as a pastor in Baptist and Pentecostal churches before coming out as gay, launched the initial congregation in his Los Angeles living room in 1968. When the denomination was officially established in 1970, there were a handful of congregations, spanning several states. By 1972, there were 35 congregations in 19 states. Today, the MCC consists of over 200 congregations in over 30 countries around the world (although this entry focuses on the U.S. and Canada).

Perry served as Moderator (the denominationâs head) until 2005, and since then there have been three Moderators. Rev. Elder Cecilia Eggleston was elected Moderator in 2019. Every three years, all MCC ministers and selected members gather for General Conference, where the Moderator and the Governing Board (administrative leadership) are elected.

Individual congregations maintain a great deal of autonomy over their worship practices, and thus there is a wide variety of worship styles in the MCC. Many churches blend charismatic and more formal influences. One of the few denomination-wide requirements for worship is that every congregation offer Holy Communion at weekly services.

The theologically diverse denomination defies easy labels of ""conservative"" and âliberal.â For decades, the denominationâs doctrinal statements proudly proclaimed that the MCC âmoved in the mainstream of Christianity,â which they defined by the Apostlesâ and Nicene creeds. Additionally, these doctrinal statements made what most would deem to be orthodox Protestant affirmations, such as âAll men are justified to God through Faithâ and âthe Bible is the divinely inspired Word of God.â 

In the twenty-first century, however, the denomination's official proclamations of doctrine have become less insistently âorthodox.â Even as the personal theologies of many MCC ministers and members continue to resemble âorthodox Protestantâ beliefs, the denominationâs Statement of Faith now includes proclamations like âWe don't all believe exactly the same thingsâ and âWe are part of an ongoing conversation on matters of belief and faith, shaped by scripture and the historic creedsâ (with no attendant declaration of the scriptureâs divine inspiration). 

If there is one unifying theological theme across the MCC, from its inception to the present, it is the belief that support for LGBTQ equality is an outgrowth of authentic Christian faith, which is âgrounded in God's radically inclusive love for all peopleâ (as the current Statement of Faith puts it). In recent years, what began as the churchâs focus on equality for âhomosexualsâ has expanded, at least in many of the denominationâs circles, to include a focus on social justice issues more broadly.",1968,2020,1049,785,William Stell,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-24 00:32:51.624 +0200,2020-08-16 22:19:01.702 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.0003036857640932551,0.026341806773536147,1.778897188823537e-15,0.033433137816339595,0.00013187420492354575,2.2090623598624163e-12,6.549260936274293e-05,0.9113341694201208,0.02838983340941306
896,SannÅ ShintÅ,43,Religious Group (v6),"SannÅ shintÅ refers to narratives, doctrinal analyses and artistic depictions related to the âmountain sovereignsâ (jp. SannÅ), the deities of the Hie shrine, now Hiyoshi taisha, in Sakamoto at the foothills of Mount Hiei. 
In SannÅ shintÅ, the identity of the Hie deities is chiefly conceptualised with the vocabulary and semiotic framework of Tendai Buddhism, and in special (but not exclusive) relation to the lineages residing at the Enryakuji on Mount Hiei, to this day the main Tendai centre in Japan. While the first extant sources relating the Hie deities to the Enryakuji date back to the ninth century, SannÅ shintÅ reached its apex as a discourse in the middle ages (12th-15th century), throughout which the majority of the material extensively treating the identities of the deities was collected.
More concretely, SannÅ shintÅ can be defined in two ways. In a narrow sense, it only indicates discourses produced at the Enryakuji, mostly mythological and doctrinal, which establish correspondences between the deities of Hie and specific Buddhas and bodhisattvas. Although SannÅ is a collective term for the whole host of deities enshrined in the twenty-one shrines of Hie, most often the âmountain sovereignsâ are three of them: Åmiya, presiding over the western compound of the shrines; Ninomiya, presiding over the eastern, and ShÅshinji, also a deity of the western compound. In the âstrictâ definition of SannÅ shintÅ, these are considered as emanations of, or identical to, three Buddhas: ÅÄkyamuni, the main Buddha of the Western pagoda area of the Enryakuji (saitÅ), Yakushi (sskr. Bhaiá¹£ajyaguru), presiding over the Konpon chudo in the Eastern pagoda area, and Amida (sskr. Amitabha), presiding over the Yokawa area. Such correspondences are sanctioned by monastic treatises such as the KeiranshÅ«yÅshÅ« (14th century).
At a broader level, however, we can say that SannÅ shintÅ is also made up of discourses on the deities of Hie that do not quite befit the narrow interpretation. For instance, these might be mythological accounts produced at the Hie shrine, touching upon subjects such as the origin and enshrinement of the deities; accounts of the festival held each year for the deities, as well as monastic discourses which do not quite conceptualise the deities within the same correspondences of the narrow definition. In this entry I shall adopt the broader definition for three reasons. Firstly, because the medieval Hie shrines and Enryakuji were closely intertwined from an institutional point of view. Secondly, because the correspondences of the narrow definition do not represent the full extent of the diachronic evolution of SannÅ shintÅ. Thirdly, because the ânarrowâ definition of SannÅ shintÅ presupposes the âbroaderâ one, especially from a mythological perspective. Thirdly, because textual material that presents the correspondences of the ânarrowâ version of SannÅ shintÅ often also includes accounts produced not by monastics, but by priestly lineages at the shrines. Such is the case for two of the the texts which are considered synonymous with SannÅ shintÅ, YÅtenki (13-15th century) and Sange YÅryakki (13th century).
Taking account of this, in consulting this entry one should keep in mind at all times that SannÅ shintÅ was not a conscious religious group, but a discursive field comprising various mythologies, ritual and devotional aspects, all joined together by being centred on the same deities and the same place. 
Please note that this article focuses on the medieval discourse on the Hie deities, but not on SannÅ ichijutsu shintÅ, the pre-modern discourse issued from SannÅ shintÅ but focused on the TÅshÅgÅ«, in Nikko.",800,1571,1050,787,Emanuela Sala,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-24 09:53:43.566 +0200,2022-11-08 23:40:20.497 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.014245095539643236,0.1557918771053075,9.635895098213949e-14,0.21045254476765868,0.00042935974627887684,1.0597697107799117e-12,0.10242217967564252,0.46293750363582287,0.05372143952849026
897,Gaengjeongyudo,43,Religious Group (v6),"Gaengjeongyudo is a Korean new religion founded by Kang Daeseong in during the colonial period. Kang, whose religious name is Yeongsindang, was born in 1890 in North Jeolla province. After years of spiritual practice which was also accompanied by his wife and son, Yeongsindang attained a form of spiritual awakening, or enlightment, after which he began to display supernatural and prophetic abilities, and gain disciples. The object of faith in Gaengjeongyudo is an astrological diagram called Seondanggung, which is composed of elements such as the East and the West, the Yin and the Yang, and 24 seasons and periods. At the core of Gaengjeongyudoâs tenets is the notion that the three traditions of Confucianism, Buddhism, and âSeonâ (native Korean belief of spirituality and heaven) should be harmonised. It is believed that we are currently living through a time of great change in the universal order, and the questions and answers concerning the future vision are contained in detail in Bueunggyeong, the core scripture written by the founder himself. Followers of Gaengjeongyudo are best known for their traditionalist way of living, and although the membership has significantly declined over the years, many of the followers still reside in Cheonghakdong, maintaining their distinctive lifestyle. Although Gaengjeongyudo is often categorised as a Confucianism-based new religious movement due to the name and distinct traditionalist outlook, such classification is highly disputable. While elements of Confucianism can be found especially from the adherence to Confucian virtues such as loyalty and filial piety, incorporation of Confucian elements in varying extent is in fact a very common characteristic to most native Korean new religions of syncretic nature. Based on the unique scriptures, religious symbols and distinct objects of faith, Gaengjeongyudo is distinguished from Confucianism-based movements such as Daedonggyo and Gonggyo, which placed great emphasis on classical Confucian texts and philosophy.",1928,2020,717,781,Yeonju Lee,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-24 11:50:35.920 +0200,2020-08-03 23:17:58.655 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),1.6630407663535552e-13,6.083013195592838e-14,0.3379289906296943,0.5671086767612555,0.07436801278129496,3.1876686758955574e-13,0.02059383558008613,4.551548712778374e-24,4.84247123346147e-07
899,Nahdlatul Ulama (NU),43,Religious Group (v6),"Nahdlatul Ulama is an Islamic mass organization in Indonesia. The organization was founded in 1926 by Hasyim Asyari in Surabaya, East Java, in response to the increasing presence of modernist Islam in the Dutch East Indies and the institutional force of Muhammadiyah, a modernist Islamic mass organization. The stated goal of the organization was to defend the interests and values of the scholars of traditionalist Sunni Islam, Ash'ari theology, and the Shafi'i school of jurisprudence. 

Although the organization has a central leadership, there are many additional centers of authority underneath this top level, including provincial and regional branches and autonomous affiliated organizations for certain groups (e.g. women, youth, students). The beating heart of the organization is the network of traditionalist Islamic schools called (pesantren), where the future leaders and scholars of the organization are educated. Through the extensive pesantren network, the organization is able to reach and recruit constituents in a widely dispersed geographic area. The kyai or leaders of these pesantren are furthermore authoritative figures in their respective communities that exceeds the education of youth. 

The organization has undergone multiple shifts in its almost century-long history. During the last years of Dutch colonial rule and the Japanese occupation (1942-45), Nahdlatul Ulama became politically active. After independence, Nahdlatul Ulama and the modernist Islamic mass organization Muhammadiyah worked together in a political party, Masyumi, representing the interests of Indonesian Muslims; but due to internal conflicts, Nahdlatul Ulama withdrew from Masyumi in 1952 and founded their own political party. The organization remained active in party politics until 1984. Since this time, it has not been directly involved in party politics. 

Since the fall of the New Order in 1998, Nahdlatul Ulama has taken an active role in the formation in what they consider a tolerant, civil, and moderate Islam. In 1999, the renowned former chairman of Nahdlatul Ulama, Abdurrahman Wahid (more commonly known as Gus Dur) became the first democratically elected president of Reformation Era Indonesia. While his tenure as president was only two years long, his vision for the organization and the relation between the country and Islam continues to shape the organization until today. Gus Dur is held up as a hallmark of a friendly, accommodating, and tolerant Islam. Since 2015, this vision of a moderate Islam has become known within Nahdlatul Ulama as âIslam Nusantara,â the Islam of the Indonesian world, a term which points to the organizationâs commitment to embracing local culture, to coexisting peacefully with others, and to being an bulwark against radical Islamic influence.",1926,2020,1053,735,Verena Meyer,37,William Noseworthy,2020-07-26 22:02:17.972 +0200,2020-07-27 22:40:45.838 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),1.4113876618910131e-18,1.412076529851324e-14,0.006840336623790616,2.1650727233842235e-13,0.0009970486362954481,8.092852292391068e-37,1.0682625591155288e-07,4.626380953868657e-24,0.9921625079134275

Our primary evidence for this group derives from the Jewish historian Josephus (d. ca 100 CE), early Christian literature, and the later Tannaitic literature. According to Josephus (War 2.8; Ant. 13.5.9; 13.10.6; 18.1.2-6), the Pharisees are one of three ""philosophical sects"" of the Jews, who ""are friendly to one another, and are for the exercise of concord, and regard for the public"" (War 2.8.14; trans. Whiston). The group appears to have formed sometime during the Hasmonean period (ca. 140 BCE) as an influential party among a majority of the Jewish people. As a political entity, they appear to have gained popularity in response to the Sadducees and the Hasmonean High Priest John Hyrcanus, securing political leverage under Salome Alexandra. 

The Gospel sources offer a polemical portrayal of the Pharisees at odds with the early Jesus movement (Matthew 23:1-39), often engaging in ritualistic dispute with Jesus and his disciples (Mark 7:1-23). In other early Christian sources, the apostle Paul identifies himself with the Pharisees (Acts 22:3; 23:6; Philippians 3:5; Galatians 1:14), and elsewhere, is depicted as actively persecuting members of the early Jesus movement (Acts 8:1-3). In these sources, a positive portrayal of the Pharisees may be found in the figure of Gamaliel (Acts 5:34-42), who persuades the Sanhedrin to show mercy to followers of Jesus. 

The term Pharisee may derive from the Hebrew word ""to separate"" (perushim); however, this etymology has been recently questioned (Rivkin, ""Who Were the Pharisees?""). The sectarian boundaries of the Pharisees were determined by a commitment to food and purity rituals laid out in Oral (e.g., ""tradition of the fathers"") and Written (e.g., the Torah) traditions. Their belief system consists of monotheism, an afterlife (of both reward and punishment), the immortality of the soul (especially in contrast to the Sadducees), and resurrection for the righteous. In the literary evidence, Pharisees are often characterized as the leading experts in interpreting the law and, according to Josephus, less stringent in rendering punitive judgement than the Sadducees.",-150,70,485,771,M.

906,The Church of England,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Church of England is the established church of the nation of England and has its origin in Henry VIII's break from Rome in 1534. The so-called 'Elizabethan Settlement' was an attempt by Queen Elizabeth I to find a via media between the radical Protestantism of the Puritan movement and the excesses of Roman Catholicism. As such, under Queen Elizabeth, the Church of England established its identity as Reformed and Catholic: 'Reformed' in the sense that it identified its theological authority not primarily in the traditions of the Church but in Scripture, and 'Catholic' in the sense that it retained such Catholic traits as an emphasis upon the apostolic succession of bishops, the sacramental identity of the Church, a formal liturgical character, and the Church's continuity with the Medieval and Patristic past.
In the modern period (here demarcated as beginning in 1963 with the publication of the significant work of liberal theology 'Honest to God', by the then Bishop of Woolwich John Robinson), the Church of England's identity and sources of authority are contested. Although its sources of doctrine and practice are still formally codified in Canon Law as deriving from Scripture and its historical formularies - the Book of Common Prayer, the 1662 Ordinal, and the Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion - there is wide divergence of opinion as to how this is to be understood.
The current 'parties' in the Church of England can be divided into three: Evangelical, Catholic and Liberal. Evangelicals emphasize the Reformed heritage of the Church of England and note the authority of Scripture. Catholics stress the importance of the Church's sacraments, its links to the Medieval and Patristic past, and its relationship with other episcopally led churches such as the Roman Catholic Church. Liberals highlight the role of reason in the interpretation of Scripture and the historic formularies. The existence of these different 'traditions' within the Church of England results in a sense of its contested identity: doctrine, belief and practice often vary dramatically from church to church. Its unifying feature must be said therefore to be the institutional structure focussed on the ecclesiastical hierarchy - archbishops, bishops, priests etc. - and the centralized and diocesan adminstrations which oversee parishes and other institutions within the Church.",1963,2020,725,793,Jamie Franklin,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-28 11:33:10.109 +0200,2020-08-05 17:05:20.676 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.0003036857640932551,0.026341806773536147,1.778897188823537e-15,0.033433137816339595,0.00013187420492354575,2.2090623598624163e-12,6.549260936274293e-05,0.9113341694201208,0.02838983340941306
910,Christian Base Community movement,43,Religious Group (v6),"Christian Base Communities (in Spanish: Comunidades Eclesiales de Base or CEBs) spread across Latin America in the years following the CELAM Bishop's conference in MedellÃ­n, Colombia in 1968. Associated with the emergence of Latin American liberation theology, CEBs of the late 1960s began as community formation projects led by missionary nuns and priests in poor communities. Their model and method took inspiration from Paulo Freireâs Pedagogy of the Oppressed (1968), the Second Vatical Council (1962 â 1965), from early Catholic Action programs, and from the social and political critiques that emerged among liberation movements across the region following the Cuban Revolution. Throughout the 1970s, CEBs became increasingly lay-led and developed into a powerful religious and political social movement. As such, while CEBs often formed larger regional or national organizations to facilitate communication and political mobilization, this movement was broadly grassroots, disaggregated, and pluralistic in theology, practice, and sense of purpose. Despite their significant diversity, Latin American CEBs shared common tendencies such as: lay leadership and greater lay participation in liturgical life, small community worship and organization, an emphasis on gender parity, a commitment to grassroots politics, a Marxist and liberation theology-informed social critique, and a spiritual educational model rooted in lay analysis of scripture applied to present, worldly concerns. CEBs continue to exist in many Latin American countries, though their prevalence and social influence declined markedly after the mid-1990s in most places.",1968,1998,1062,798,Brendan Jordan,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-28 23:21:42.925 +0200,2020-07-29 09:00:49.322 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.005622084359710281,0.3637865096935926,6.797809616184385e-16,0.018277915733465457,2.2825747422436004e-13,0.608618701336255,0.0036945876267749774,2.0124997280499532e-07,4.572600312048772e-19
914,Tariqa Shadhiliyya,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Tariqa Shadhiliyya is a Sufi order dating back to the 13th Century CE.  It takes its name from Abu al-Hasan al-Shadhili who was born in the Ghumara region of Morocco (1196) and died in Humaythara, Egypt (1258).  Originating in the milieu of the western Islamic world (Andalusia and al-Maghrib), the Shadhiliyya spread through North Africa (via Tunisia) and established a firm foundation in the Middle East as one of the prominent Sufi orders of the medieval and modern Muslim world.  Influences on the al-Shadhili included figures in this western Islamic world such as Abu Madyan (d. 1198), Abd al-Salam b. Mashish (d. 1227), and Ibn Arabi (d. 1240).  It also emerged in the political context of the Almohad revolt against the Almoravids, and therefore the emphasis of the former on the absolute unity of Allah (the principle of tawhid) became a component of al-Shadhiliâs teachings, although it was filtered through Ibn Arabiâs conceptions of wahdat al-wujud (unity of existence).  While influenced by his contemporaries, al-Shadhili saw himself not as merely an inheritor but as the creator of a distinctive path (tariqa).  In the case of al-Shadhili, this path was passed on through specific prayers and formulaic sayings whose repetition is integral to the spiritual development of the disciple (e.g., hizb, dhikr, wird, duâa).  Although these core practices remain present, the attitude of continued reform embodied in al-Shadhiliâs teaching and reflected in the common saying âA Sufi is a child of oneâs timeâ (al-sufi ibn waqtihi) allowed certain figures cast themselves (or are cast by others) as ârenewersâ or âreformers,â and these reform movements continue to give rise to new branches.

In line with many Sufi orders, the Shadhiliyya serves as a trunk out of which many branches emerge, so it is common to see references to the Shadhiliyya in hyphenated form.  For example, a full lineage of a northern Moroccan branch founded in 2007 would read Fawziyya-Alawiyya-Karkariyya-Darqawiyya-Shadhiliyya while another Egyptian branch is Jazuliyya-Husayniyya-Shadhiliyya.  The Shadhiliyya also has several branches of 'Western Sufism' (or led by western converts to Islam) such as the Murabitun (led by Ian Dallas aka Shaykh Abd al-Qadir al-Sufi), the Maryamiyya (founded by Fritjof Schuon), and Nuh Ha Mim Keller's Shadhili group in Jordan.  This interaction is not new, however, since its Andalusian spread potentially influenced a few Christian mystics like St. John of the Cross and Teresa of Avila.

What unites these distinct branches is that they trace their âtariqaâ (literally path or way) back to al-Shadhili through a spiritual lineage (silsila).  The term âtariqaâ has most often been translated as âorder,â often drawing on an analogy between Sufi and monastic orders.  However, rather than referring simply to the social group, tariqa refers to the way of life that leads one to live a pious life and potentially encounter the divine.  This âway of lifeâ consists of an ensemble of exercises performed under the supervision and with the guidance of a master shaykh.  For example, the recitation of prayers (ahzab) attributed to the founder or the performance of poetry from a collective corpus of poems (diwan) from famous Shadhili shaykhs are a major part of what defines a group as Shadhili.  

In the case of the Shadhiliyya, some of the prominent figures include:

-	Abu al-Abbas al-Mursi (d. 1271): Considered al-Shadhiliâs successor, al-Mursi was an Andalusian Sufi now considered to be one of the main saints of Egypt.  

-	Al-Busiri (d. 1294): This Moroccan author of the famous poem âThe Mantleâ (al-Burda) was originally from southern Morocco and studied under al-Mursi in the Shadhili order.

-	Abu al-Qasim al-Himyari: Known as Ibn al-Sabbagh, he was the author of âThe Pearl of Mysteries and the Gem of Purityâ (Durrat al-Asrar wa tuhfat al-abrar) that contains valuable biographical information about al-Shadhili that details his time in Morocco, Tunisia, and Egypt, serving as a primary source for subsequent biographical dictionaries (tabaqat).

-	Ibn Ata Allah al-Iskandiri (d. 1309): Credited with consolidating and spreading al-Shadhiliâs teachings, this Egyptian leader of the Shadhiliyya is widely known for his book of aphorisms âal-Hikamâ (The Wisdom) and his autobiographical âLataâif al-minanâ (Subtle Blessings) written in 1298.  This latter work articulates a conception of sainthood connected to an inheritance from and emulation of the Prophet Muhammad.

-	Ibn Abbad al-Rundi (d. 1390): Born in Ronda, Spain, he is known for his commentary on Ibn Ata Allahâs aphorisms and for potential influences on Christian mystics in the region.  He is buried in the Bab Ftuh cemetery in Fes, Morocco.

-	Ali b. Muhammad Wafa (d. 1405): This Egyptian Sufi of Mamluk lineage created the Wafaâiyya-Shadhiliyya branch with his father Muhammad, blending a spiritual heritage from al-Shadhili with a local familial authority that allowed the father to compose unique litanies (ahzab) that were spread by his son Ali.  In addition to blending different modalities of sanctity, the Wafaâiyya branch reflects an earlier attempt to integrate the thinking of Ibn Arabi and the Shadhiliyya.

-	Muhammad al-Jazuli (d. 1465): One of the seven saints of Marrakech, this famous Moroccan Sufi wrote a compilation of prayers on the Prophet Muhammad known in short as âThe Waymarks of Benefitsâ (Dalaâil al-Khayrat).  His renown also made him a significant political figure and as he gained a following, he was expelled and eventually poisoned by a rival politician in 1465.  The Jazuliyya-Shadhiliyya became one of the most prominent and influential branches during the medieval period.

-	Ahmad Zarruq (d. 1493): Labeled as a âconservative rebelâ by scholar of Islam Scott Kugle, Zarruq challenged al-Jazuli and his followers for their acceptance of sainthood grounded in popular politics and miraculous deeds.  In contrast, Zarruq presented himself as a âjuridical saint,â deriving his sanctity from his knowledge and practice of Islamic jurisprudence and performing that sanctity through the moral criticism of his surrounding society.  As such, he rebelled against what he saw as moral corruption (due in large part to divergent and exploitative saints) by articulating a conservative, reformed Sufism that placed a greater emphasis on jurisprudence.  He is an important early modern reformist thinker that would serve as a predecessor to later Sufi reform movements.

-	Muhammad b. Isa (d. 1526): Founder of the Aissawa (Isawa) order known for its music, trance dances, and intricate rhythmic structures, he was a member of the Jazuliyya-Shadhiliyya that built his own lodge (zawiya) in Meknes, Morocco.  In Morocco today, they are often hired as musicians for different events, making them both a Sufi order and something like a professional musiciansâ guild.

-	Abd al-Rahman al-Majdhub (d. 1568): This famous Moroccan poet is known by his nickname âal-Majdhub.â  Literally meaning mad or crazy, majdhub refers to a divinely inspired madness that prevents individuals from functioning properly in ordinary life but allows them to provide insight and blessings or perform miraculous deeds.  Many of his poems are so widespread that they are transmitted not as poems but as proverbs in Morocco.  He was a student in the lineage of Ahmad Zarruq and is said to have founded a Majdhubi-Zarruqi-Shadhili branch that presented a rival vision of sainthood to the popular Jazuli-Shadhili order of the time.

-	Ahmad ibn Ajiba (d. 1809): As an initiate in the Darqawi-Shadhili branch, he was a prolific write widely known for his interpretation (tafsir) of the Quran âThe Immense Seaâ (Al-Bahr al-Madid).  

-	Muhammad al-Arabi al-Darqawi (d. 1823): This Moroccan Sufi was a spiritual, political, and military leader.  On the political and military side, he participated in revolts against foreign influences (Ottoman, Spanish, French) and against domestic leaders (Mawlay Sulayman) in the 19th century.  At the same time, many Moroccan elites and members of the Alawi royal family were members of the Darqawiyya.  In the 20th century under the French Protectorate, political expediencies resulted in a mix of confrontation and collaboration with French and Spanish authorities.  As a spiritual leader, al-Darqawi is best known through his letters and is recognized as a ârenewerâ that gave rise to multiple branches.

-	Ahmad b. Idris (d. 1837): Of Moroccan origin, although he did not formally establish his own order, this prolific figure had a tremendous influence on several modern Sufi reform movements (often glossed as neo-Sufi orders).  Three of these influences include (1) Muhammad b. Ali al-Sanusi (d. 1859) â founder of the Sanusiyya order that resisted French colonialism in Libya â(2) Muhammad Uthman al-Mirghani (d. 1852) â founder of the Khatmiyya/Mirghaniyya in Sudan that would later become central to Sudanese politics â and (3) Abd al-Rahman al-Duwayhi al-Rashid (d. 1874) â founder of the Ahmadiyya-Rashidiyya branch that would spread through East Africa, the Middle East, northern India, and southeast Asia.  His teachings included an emphasis on Islamic jurisprudence and the renewal of independent legal reasoning (ijtihad) as a way to overcome the stagnation of legal thinking and blind adherence (taqlid), as well as a spiritual doctrine of the Muhammadan Way (tariqa Muhammadiyya) that sought both the emulation of the Prophetic model (sunna) and encounter with the Prophet Muhammad in a conscious state. 

-	Abd al-Rahman al-Fasi (d. 1878): Initiated in the Darqawi-Shadhili branch, al-Fasi founded the Fasiyya branch in 1850 originally in Libya and later in Mecca with lodges in Yemen, Syria, and Egypt as well.  His most famous disciple was Abd al-Qadir al-Jizairi (d. 1883) who led a resistance movement against the French in Algeria and was eventually exiled to Damascus where he established a circle of followers under the spiritual patronage of al-Fasi.  This circle would be an important element in the development of modern Salafi thought.

-	Ahmad al-Alawi (d. 1933): Born in Mostaghanem, Algeria, Shaykh Ahmad al-Alawi (born Ahmad b. Aliywa) founded the Alawi branch of the Darqawi-Shadhili in 1914.  While working in a variety of modern fields to encourage the integration of European and Islamic ideas Shaykh Alawi had a significant influence on several European thinkers (e.g., Guenon).  He is considered a ârenewerâ of the Shadhili for his redeployment of the spiritual retreat (khalwa) with a specific articulation (talqin) of the name Allah as a primary practice for disciples.  Currently, the Alawiyya is headed by Shaykh Khalid b. Tunis and has membership throughout Europe and North Africa.",1258,2020,1064,800,John Thibdeau,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-29 19:49:11.594 +0200,2020-08-14 20:37:22.557 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),1.22702315498779e-13,9.955664691967863e-13,4.345273313179957e-14,0.5842952980556712,0.005418185518219503,0.4100456321473295,0.00024079334144644563,5.0180305485151854e-12,9.09311537196804e-08
915,Protestantism welcoming People with Disabilities,43,Religious Group (v6),"This group is unified by commitment to the inclusion of people with disabilities, rather than by geographical or other doctrinal unanimity. However, this commitment generates similar theological reflection and a shared range of social practices. Disagreement about the nature of inclusion persists; this group is distinguished by consistent participation in a conversation about disability inclusion. This entry will highlight how that conversation impacts these organizations' ritual, theology, and other social practices.

Most of this information is based on unpublished ethnographic research conducted by a team led by the Rev. Dr. Erin Raffety of the Center for Theological Inquiry from May - December of 2019, of which I was a part. Our team of 6 researchers worked with 10 organizations in the NJ-NY-PA area who were intentionally welcoming people with disabilities, with the goal of seeing what worked well and what could be done better. We received IRB approval before starting research from New England IRB. All participants signed consent forms showing their awareness of the research. Notes that lack explicit citation are based on this fieldwork, which will be published under the title, From Inclusion to Leadership: Congregational Ministry with People with Disabilities by Eerdmans Publishing in 2021. 

Through fieldwork, it became clear to me and the rest of our research team that one central question for these organizations concerns integrated vs segregated ministry. Ought churches start new programs to specifically welcome people with various disabilities? Or ought they reform their current programs and services such that people with disabilities can access them more effectively? 

Another prominent theme was reflection on the role of the Church in promoting the life and rights of people with disabilities. What ought churches provide and how can churches best support other non-profit organizations and schools that are already welcoming and supporting people with various kinds of disabilities? 

A final theme was the importance of empowering people with disabilities in addition to merely welcoming them. Many churches were eager to discuss different forms this could take, especially with regard to intellectual disability. Some were more reluctant but still open. What does it mean for people with intellectual disabilities in particular to be not just objects of ministry, but subjects? How might churches refine their conceptions of ministry and discipleship in light of this?

In this entry, I use the terms âpeople with disabilitiesâ and âdisabled peopleâ interchangeably to represent some of the range of ways people with disabilities identify, some preferring person-first language and others not. Our research included people with a variety of physical disabilities (eg. blindness, mobility impairments), intellectual disabilities (Autism Spectrum Disorder, Downâs Syndrome), chronic illness (Crohn's, diabetes), and mental health challenges (depression, Bipolar Disorder).",2000,2020,1065,802,Kevin Vollrath,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-29 21:57:54.030 +0200,2020-08-15 23:25:33.415 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.0003036857640932551,0.026341806773536147,1.778897188823537e-15,0.033433137816339595,0.00013187420492354575,2.2090623598624163e-12,6.549260936274293e-05,0.9113341694201208,0.02838983340941306
919,Catholicism in contemporary Croatia,43,Religious Group (v6),"This database entry pertains to Roman Catholicism in contemporary Croatia. The geographical area covered corresponds to today's boundaries of the Republic of Croatia and the time period is delimited from 1995 to present-day (2020). Catholics represent the majority of the population in contemporary Croatia and have a very significant influence in the culture and politics of the country. It is widely accepted among scholars of the region that Catholicism is tightly bound together with Croatian ethnicity and national identity.

Undoubtedly, there are continuities between the religious group defined in this entry and other Catholic groups, in particular those in contemporary South and Southeastern Europe. Among these groups, Catholic Croats living in Bosnia and Herzegovina (especially in the region of Herzegovina) and some regions of Serbia (e.g. Vojvodina) stand out. These populations largely identify as part of a single ethnic group that shares history and traditions (religious and otherwise) with most of the population of Croatia. Nevertheless, Catholic Croats residing in neighboring countries or those living further afield, sometimes referred to as Croatian diaspora, are not included in this entry. The reason for this is that there are important differences in regard to their relationship to the state, the political status of their religious group and identity, and their interaction with other religious groups within the polity in which they live.

Regarding the similarity between Catholicism in Croatia and elsewhere, there is also a significant degree of coincidence. The Catholic Church in Croatia is in full communion with the Vatican, which means that all dogma, doctrine and cannon law are essentially the same as in the rest of the world. However, particular histories and socio-cultural contexts produce unique features in tradition, practice and even belief in every context, and Croatia is no exception. In this database entry, specific elements and idiosyncrasies that distinguish Croatian Catholicism, such as the importance of pilgrimages, are elaborated in the qualitative notes of the relevant questions.

Just like in the geographical dimension, in the temporal one there is significant continuity between Croatian Catholicism as described in this entry and that of preceding historical periods (e.g. S. XX). This continuity is particularly clear in the domains of religious belief and practice. However, that is not the case in the political, sociological and cultural domains. In this entry, 'contemporary' has been defined as the period from 1995 onward. This year marks the beginning of a peaceful, democratic period in the history of Croatia, existing as an independent nation, that lasts until the present. The period comes immediately after a violent war (1991-1994) where the Republic of Croatia fought against the central  government in Belgrade to gain independence from the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. This war is part of what is commonly referred to as the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s, which led to the eventual disintegration of the SFR of Yugoslavia. The history of this series of armed conflicts is very complex and is outside of the scope of this database. However, it is important to know that the main factions involved are generally defined along ethno-religious lines and that the conflicts were plagued with atrocities committed along these same lines. Therefore, 1995 represents the beginning of the peacetime political order that still prevails in Croatia; an order which is different from the preceding one in regard to, among other things, the status of, and relationships between, different religious groups within the country.

Finally, it is important to note that, in a database entry such as this one, it is impossible to make justice to the richness and diversity of experience, practice, belief and tradition of any religious group and, especially, one with millions of members and a theological tradition of two millennia. The yes/no answers in this entry aim to reflect the most general response to the questions. However, there are cases where such general answers are not possible. This could be because there is no doctrine regarding a specific issue and no general consensus among members of the group, because there is are differences between the doctrine of the Church and widespread beliefs or practices, or simply because the issues are contested even among religious specialists. In general, when there is no obvious consensus answer to a question, this entry favours Church doctrine and teachings, in particular as defined by the Catechism of the Catholic Church. When this is not possible, or when the practices or beliefs of Catholics in Croatia differ overwhelmingly from doctrine, then the popular view is favoured. In these cases, explanations, caveats and further clarifications are included in the qualitative notes.",1995,2020,1068,801,Miguel Alcalde,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-30 20:39:37.226 +0200,2020-08-14 19:57:09.527 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.005196517729657229,0.9632545008113809,2.1841025610967475e-15,0.026859433611581694,2.7133035276915636e-14,8.468295043273649e-12,0.00468442221348244,5.125624379120021e-06,1.0211964517610795e-12
921,Bhils,43,Religious Group (v6),"Bhils are a part of a geospatially dispersed tribal community of Western India. They are grouped under the constitutional category of Scheduled Tribes. While Bhili is the main language for the community, Bhils are known to be conversant with a variety of other vernacular languages depending on the region they reside in. Bhils have a rich tradition of orally transmitted religious literature which shares similarities with classical Hindu mythology and yet it is distinct in its own vernacular way. Bhils pay reverence to most popular Hindu gods, rituals, and customs; however, most of the gods and associated practices have hybrid histories with classical myths and practices fluidly blending in with vernacular variants.  


The term Bhil is thought to be derived from the word, Vill, which means bow in Telugu and Kannada. This is keeping in line with their reputation as skilled archers and hunters.  Historically, powerful Bhil kings are thought to have established their own kingdoms in what is present day Gujarat and Rajasthan. It was only through displacement by Rajput and Chalukya rulers of that time that Bhils were made to retreat into forests and hilly regions. Bhils are mentioned in historical records such as Ain-i-Akbari and ancient folk legends such as Kathasaritasagar. Mention of Bhils becomes clearer in the medieval period where their association with Marathas in their fight against the Mughals is well documented. Their knowledge of hilly and jungle terrains made them valuable allies for political powers hoping to control these regions. While some Bhil chiefs decided to assist local political powers, other clan chiefs would resort to resisting these powers often resulting in violent plunders of settled populations. With the influx of British colonialism, the anthropological urge to identify Bhils with primitivity and a prehistorical core of ancient India crystallized Bhil identity as that of Indian aborigines and native inhabitants of India. The British with their military might were more efficient in suppressing raids and plunders by Bhil chiefs. Through diplomatic ties and political manoeuvring, the British were also able to enlist peace treaties with the Bhils and also form Bhil Corps, an integral arm of the colonial law enforcement setup. 


Certain Indological scholarship and popular belief maintains that Bhils are the descendants of Niá¹£Äda tribes mentioned in the Hindu epics, Ramayana and Mahabharata. This association can be mainly traced to descriptions of Niá¹£Ädarashtra (the Kingdom of Niá¹£Ädas) as lying between Vindhya and Satpura mountains â the present-day heartland of Bhils. Due to this connection, several characters in the epics such as Eklavya in the Mahabharata and Sabari in Ramayana are thought to be Bhils. A similar historical and communal consciousness, along with issues of socioeconomic marginalization and lack of state assistance for rural development, has led to the development of indigenous political movements. One such movement aims to generate support for the creation of a separate state ""Bhil Pradesh"" to be carved out from specific districts of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, and Madhya Pradesh.",1700,2020,1070,775,Maharshi Vyas,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-30 22:24:11.149 +0200,2020-08-22 21:04:50.896 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.015841358588155857,1.7823796288704067e-09,4.627213886345604e-14,0.041855122878559005,4.2664774636360815e-16,8.40085440699478e-25,0.9357624996068867,0.004782483562757505,0.001758533581214508
925,Rabbinic Judaism (Babylonia),43,Religious Group (v6),"The Babylonian Jewish community dates back to the 6th century BCE, with the exile following the destruction of the first temple. Rabbinic Judaism emerges in Roman Palestine following the destruction of the second temple, producing legal and exegetical texts (the Mishna, Tosefta, and Halakhic Midrashim) during the Tannaitic Era. With the close of the Tannaitic era c.220 CE, the Amoraic sages Rav and Shmuel moved to Babylonia and began to teach Rabbinic traditions to the community there.


During the Amoraic Era (c. 220-500 CE), and the subsequent Saboraic and Gaonic eras, rabbinic teachings were collected and edited into the Babylonian Talmud, a corpus nearly 2 million words long. These traditions encompass a range of genre including biblical interpretation, legal discussions, theology, angels and demons, humor, and history. 

Jews primarily lived along the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. This region was home to a diverse population including Christians, Manichaeans, and Zoroastrians (the official Persian religion).

As a community with roots dating back centuries, Jews in the Sassanian Empire were tolerated and permitted to practice. An official position of ""Exilarch"" was recognized by the Empire. Literary accounts in the Talmud and Gaonic sources speak of persecutions against Jews by the empire in the latter part of this period, although scholars debate their historicity.

The map covers the region of the major Jewish settlements within Babylonia, not the entirety of the Babylonian empire. The dates examined range from 220-650 CE, corresponding roughly to the dates of the Sassanian Empire and the development of the Babylonian Talmud.",220,650,1073,805,Yoni Nadiv,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-07-31 15:06:21.827 +0200,2020-08-13 04:52:57.446 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.008312696759609923,0.25324588573465073,3.791162647397565e-15,0.3204097578692452,0.003905030370266177,0.3437816198171392,0.0017369950549737483,0.06860792161148206,9.278262918317761e-08
927,Zealots,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Zealots were a Jewish sect of the first-century CE that appeared after the Roman occupation of Palestine. They are often characterized by their active resistance to Roman rule. Our primary resource for data concerning the Zealots comes from the Jewish historian, Josephus (War 2.4; 2.13; 2.22; 4.3; Ant. 14.9; 14.15; 16.9; 20.9), who offers a biased presentation of certain radical sectarian movements during the First Jewish Revolt (66-73 CE). For this reason, historical descriptions of the Zealots within Josephus are to be evaluated with caution. Josephus makes reference to a ""fourth philosophy"" that he speaks of with great disdain. In addition to the Pharisees, Sadducees, and Essenes, this philosophy is founded by Judas the Galilean or ""of Gaulanitis"" (see also Acts 5:37) and a certain Pharisee named Saddok. This philosophy attracted a great many people, some of whom were young and ""zealous"" (Ant. 18.1). Other characteristics that Josephus ascribes to Judas' movement include a close affiliation with the philosophy of the Pharisees, an interest in freedom, and a belief that only God should be their ruler. 

Elsewhere, early Christian literature refers to a disciple of Jesus with the titular Simon ""the Zealot"" (Luke 6:15; Acts 1:13); however, it is unclear if this terms refers to a religious group, a character trait of Simon (e.g., one who possesses zeal), or a geographical references (Matt 10:4; Mark 3:18). 

The Sicarii are traditionally understood as a more radical and violent subset of the Zealots led by the descendent of Judas, Eleazar (Josephus calls them a ""another sort of robbers"" in War 2.13); however, our sources are not always clear and some have advocated that the two groups be viewed as distinct from each other. The Greek term sikarios is a Latin loan word, meaning assassin, originating in Josephus (War 7.8-11; Ant. 20.9) with a lone reference in the book of Acts (21:38). It appears that the term derives from their weapon of choice, short daggers (see scimitar or sica). According to Josephus, the Sicarii assassinate Jonathan the High Priest and continue on from there to preform ""many"" other ""daily"" murders. The Sicarii are traditionally associated with Masada because of our account in Josephus: they are described as holding the fortress at Masada against the Romans (7.8.2), eventually committing mass suicide at the behest of Eleazar ben Yair; an event that some have described as Josephus' own literary invention. A wealth of archaeological discoveries have been made at Masada, which has lead some to corroborate Josephus' stories with material data (Yadin, Masada [1966]); however, such literal connections have been rightly questioned (see Jodi Magness, Masada: From Jewish Revolt to Modern Myth [2019]).

One of the challenges in differentiating these groups is the range of terms used in our sources including ""robbers"" (Greek: lÄstai), ""sicarii""  (Latin: sicarius), ""Galileans"" (see Acts 5:37; Epictetus, Diss. 4.7.6), the ""Barjone"" in rabbinic texts, and the Zealots. Especially outside of Josephus in later rabbinic writings (e.g., Maksh 1.6), these terms appear to take on different meanings. For example, the term Zealot itself has come under scrutiny because the etymology of the semitic term ""zeal"" (qn') possesses a range of meaning outside of Josephus, including one who is zealous for God. With that said, some scholars insist that distinctions are necessary and important, especially considering the more violent descriptions of the Sicarii. Richard Horsley has characterized the Zealots as a group of ""non-violent, if active, resistance"" in stark contrast to the Sicarii (Bandits, Prophets, and Messiahs, 199). In one passage, Josephus appears to make a clear distinction between the Sicarii and Zealots (esp. War 7.8). Nonetheless, our source material is limited in that Josephus is both inconsistent and also shows contempt for both groups.",0,74,485,771,M.

931,The Society of Jesus (Jesuits) in Britain,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Jesuits are a Catholic missionary order that follows the tradition of St Ignatius of Loyola, the first Superior General of the Jesuits in 1541. The Jesuits are the largest Catholic order of men in the world, and their headquarters are in Rome, close to the Vatican. Pope Francis is the first Jesuit Pope. 

The Society of Jesus in Britain, commonly known as the Jesuits, came to Britain during a mission from Italy in 1580. Jesuits are neither monks nor friars but 'clerks regular'. They take vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience and live in community. Most are priests, but there have always been Jesuit brothers who assist the Society's mission without ordination. Many Jesuit priests also take a fourth vow, unique to the Society of Jesus, of special obedience to the Pope with regard to missions. Jesuit historiography in Britain can is typically organized by Jesuit activity pre and post suppression with regards to The Reformation in Europe. A significant aspect of the history of the English Jesuits after their restoration was their missionary outreach. New missionary endeavors by the English Province of Jesuits included began in 1837â94, and the English Province of Jesuits still maintains a mission in Guyana. The Jesuits first came to Guyana in 1857. Since then, we have been serving the Catholic Church & people in all parts of this beautiful, remote, and oft-forgotten South American country.

933,Marcionites,43,Religious Group (v6),"Marcionism was a branch of early Christian thought often deemed ""gnostic"" or heretical by detractors like Tertullian of Carthage. It is often associated with Marcion of Pontus, a second-century Christian preacher that came to Rome around 144 CE. Marcion is best remembered for his belief that Jesus was the Savior, but was sent by a God other than the one known to readers of Jewish Scripture. Instead of representing the God of Israel, Marcion believed that Jesusâs God was not the God that created the universe, but was a deity that was not known among humans until Jesusâs arrival.

Marcion is best known for his compilation of Christian texts. Marcion read the Gospel of Luke and ten of Paulâs letters, and some scholars have suggested that Marcionâs use of these eleven texts constituted one of our earliest Christian canons. Paul, as apostle to the Gentiles, was understood by Marcion to be one of the few early Christians who understood that Jesus preached a different God than the God of Israel. However, it is unclear of Marcion himself initiated the collection of Paulâs letters that he used, or utilized a collection already in use. The same goes for Marcionâs use of the Gospel of Luke. Some heresiologists argued that Marcion mutilated the Gospel text by removing particular scenes, such as the birth narrative of Jesus. However, it seems likely that Marcion used a version of Lukeâs gospel already in circulation.

Early heresiologists like Justin, Tertullian, and Epiphanius preserve much of our information about Marcion and Marcionite Christians. However, their work is tinged with polemic and likely does not represent Marcionâs own thought, but rather what other Christians feared about Marcionite treatments of God, Christ, and scripture. They accuse Marcion of extreme asceticism and for treating Jesus as a human upon whom Christ descended, as well as that he divorces Jesusâs teaching from any continuity with Jewish scriptures.",144,1000,1080,754,Chance Bonar,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-02 18:11:17.199 +0200,2020-08-02 18:11:17.199 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),6.922023818614209e-06,0.003602984051395911,0.0033492924273969627,0.04884378575178652,0.9441906368776917,3.1442639948375768e-12,4.180196998600532e-06,1.1206167959666335e-12,2.1986666469731203e-06
935,Nigerian Pentecostalism,43,Religious Group (v6),"Pentecostalism has become a major cultural force in Nigeria since the early twentieth century, accounting for approx. 63% of Nigerian Christians today (World Christian Database). The success of Pentecostalism across Nigeria and Africa more widely has resulted in the widespread absorption of Pentecostal styles of worship into 'mainstream' African Protestant and Catholic churches (the latter known as 'Charismatic' churches). Pentecostals emphasise the active presence of the Holy Spirit both in worship settings and beyond, evidenced in miracles, healings, prophecies, tongues (glossolalia) and other 'gifts of the Spirit'. Nigerian Pentecostals tend to regard their religious faith as a means by which to âbreakâ with their âpaganâ heritage, and becoming born again as a way to be delivered from indigenous African spiritual and cultural life (Meyer 1998). Some Pentecostal churches place a strong emphasis on tithing and material success (âProsperityâ), whilst others are more focused on asceticism and purity ('Holiness'), or healing and exorcism (âDeliveranceâ).
Pentecostalism in Nigeria is widely recognised to have unfolded in three phases. The first phase, known as Aladura, or the African Initiated/Independent Church movement, (1910-1930s) was led by Yoruba itinerant preachers like Joseph Ayo Babalola who clashed with missionaries on the use of medicine (Peel 1968). The Aladura movement, meaning âpraying peopleâ, emphasised prayer, healing and deliverance from traditional 'pagan' religion. In this period, foreign Pentecostal denominations like the Classical Pentecostal church, Assemblies of God, and the Welsh Apostolic church also laid down roots in Nigeria.
The second wave, known as the 'Latter Rain' revival, took place in the 1950s and was initiated by British and American evangelists like Sydney Granville Elton and Oral Roberts. This phase emphasised deliverance, healing and also apocalyptic eschatology.
The third wave, known as the Neo-Pentecostal movement, emerged in the 1960s-80s and was heavily influenced by ideas and trends introduced to Nigeria in American evangelical literature. Open air revivals, especially on university campuses such as the Universities of Ibadan and Ife, led to an influx of young converts to the movement. Some denominations emphasised Holiness and millennialism (1970s) whilst others propagated the Prosperity Gospel (80s onward). This period saw the emergence of the Nigerian Pentecostal megachurches like Deeper Life Bible Church and the Church of God Mission International. Moreover, since the 1990s, demonology, spiritual warfare and the practice of Deliverance have become increasingly popular features of Nigerian Pentecostalism.",1910,2020,1082,810,Naomi Richman,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-03 16:14:12.377 +0200,2020-08-19 14:46:38.745 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.0003036857640932551,0.026341806773536147,1.778897188823537e-15,0.033433137816339595,0.00013187420492354575,2.2090623598624163e-12,6.549260936274293e-05,0.9113341694201208,0.02838983340941306
937,Vestal Virgins,43,Religious Group (v6),"Introduction: No other religious group for women in antiquity has the same amount of written and visual evidence than the Vestal Virgins of Rome. The order of the Vestal Virgins belonged to the pontifical college (collegium pontificum) and was one of Rome's largest and most illustrious religious orders that spanned roughly a millennium. Their centrality to Roman religion and the Roman state is demonstrated by the fact that their lodging quarters was located on the Roman Forum itself that was, for most of its history, the civic center of the Roman Republic and Empire until Emperor Theodosius closed the Vestal Order in AD 394.
Even the antiquity of the Vestal Virgins described in ancient literature demonstrates their importance to Roman culture, and especially the wealth fare of the state. The Vestal order was said to have originated in the times of the legendary king Numa (Cic. Rep.2.64.14; Dion Hal. Ant.Rom. II.64.5-67.1; Ov.Fast.6.357-260; Plut.Num. 9.5), but the very first Vestal Virgin in Roman mythology was Rhea Silvia: the mother of Romulus and Remus (Livy I.4.2; Dion. Hal. Ant.Rom.I.75.1-77.4; Ov.Fast.2.383-86, 3.11), thus, the Vestals Virgins were even older than the city of Rome!
Selection Process: In order to become a Vestal Virgin, a rigid process overseen by the Pontifex Maximus ensued that scrutinized the girlâs age (no less than six and no more than ten years old), legal status (originally patrician, but later plebeians could enter), and physical condition: her virginity had to be absolute, since this was the most important qualification. An extant description of this process is recorded in Aulus Gelliusâ Atticues Noctes I.12.1-8 in which other physical requisites, such as not having any impairment to hearing or speech, and exemptions are detailed. Though rather young by modern standards, the age of seven in Roman society allowed a girl to participate in both public and private rituals. Furthermore, nearly ninety percent of girls died before the age of six and those that did were more likely to survive into adulthood and fulfill the thirty-year requirement of the Vestal order. Wildfang also postulates that the age of six aided in detecting any physical defects, especially speech impediments. Finally, Wildfang also argues that the limit of the age of ten, is to ensure that a candidateâs virginity is intact before she underwent puberty.
Once the candidates passed the requirements, it seems that the Pontifex drew lots in public during the Roman Republic according to the Lex Papia. DiLuzio notes the scholarly debate around the Lex Papia (68 BC) in which the stipulation of drawing lots âe populoâ suggests that, perhaps, at the time, plebein daughters could be candidates for the priesthood. Some evidence suggests that plebein order could participate in the Vestals as far back as 337 BC, where the Vestal Minucia was executed for incestum as Livy (VIII.15.7-8) and scholar RÃ¼pke note.
To conclude our remarks on the selection process, it is important to note some changes during the Roman Empire. DiLuzio has shown that in AD 5 Augustus opened-up the Vestal Virgins to the daughters of freedman as well when there was a shortage of candidates. Then, under Tiberius, senators could offer their daughters directly when a vacancy occurred at the death of Occia and, thus, abrogated the 20-candidate necessity.                                                                                                                                                                        
Initiation Rite: The initiation rite, what is called a âcaptioâ, is also described fully by Gellius (N.A. I.12.13-14). The Pontifex seized the selected candidate by the hand from her father and pronounced the words: sacerdotem Vestalem, quae sacra faciat quae ius siet sacerdotem Vestalem facere pro populo Romano Quiritibus, uti quae optima lege fuit, ita te, Amata, capio (Thus, I take you, Amata, just as she was of perfect law, as a Vestal priestess to do the sacred rites that the law permits the Vestal priestess to do on behalf of the Roman people). Many scholars, such as DiLuzio, Santinelli, and Mary Beard, have noted that the ritual bear a marked similarity to those of a Roman wedding in which the bride is also taken away from the lap of her mother in a simulated abduction. Furthermore, the Vestal dressed her hair in the seni crines (six-tressed) style that was also used by brides in the Roman wedding. As DiLuzio notes, these details a symbolic wedding between the Pontifex and the Vestal virgin. Parting with Beard who sees this rite that marked the Vestal as an interstitial figure, DiLuzio rejoins that it symbolizes the complete transition of the candidate from a private, domestic figure into one in service of the Roman people and state by removing her from her house.  
Duties: The legal, ritual, and privileges conferred to the Vestal Virgin depended upon her ability to maintain perpetual virginity, a quality that, apart from the Vestal Virgins, was not valued in ancient Roman life generally. DiLuzio notes that this need for perpetual virginity parallels concerns for ritual purity and that in the Roman mind these were one and the same for the Vestal Virgins. Furthermore, their virginity also symbolized the health and welfare of the Roman state. For example, Dionysius of Halicarnassus (IX.40) records a pestilence that affected Rome and, upon investigation, it was discovered that the Vestal Urbinia lost her virginity and was performing public rites. Upon the punishment of Urbinia and the two men, the plague was lifted. 
Another duty, which is also linked to their chastity, was to perpetuate the fire of Vesta, the goddess of the hearth (perhaps, as far back as the period of Roman monarchy in which Vesta was the goddess of the private, royal hearth) and heart of Rome as Staples and DiLuzio note. Dionysius of Halicarnassus (II.68) recounts that the fire of Vesta went out and a case ensued in which the Vestal Aemlia was tried. In asking for Vesta for aid, Aemlia cast her garment onto the altar and a great fire appeared as if giving proof to Aemeliaâs service and chastity.",-800,394,872,733,Juan Dopico,18,Robyn Walsh,2020-08-03 17:28:58.351 +0200,2020-08-06 21:04:06.388 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.9999172941230758,5.115212620214201e-13,3.7826482649672775e-17,4.4544924503836325e-05,5.88838558110128e-17,3.816094963320317e-05,2.420341604915249e-13,2.03347796463947e-12,6.285060293709826e-33

Although they did not self-identify as Canaanite, a substantial degree of continuity with regional Canaanite culture is reflected, for example, in the onomastics and pantheon of Ugarit.

941,Chan Buddhists in early Qing period,43,Religious Group (v6),"Chan Buddhists refer to the religious practitioners of Chan, reflected in the Chan texts like ârecorded sayingsâ and âlamp transmission.â It is believed that the legendary figure Bodhidharma from India first brought Chan to China. Eminent Chan patriarchs, especially the Sixth Patriarch Huineng (638â713), developed Chan Buddhism during the Tang-Song periods. When it came to the seventeenth century, the reprint and publication of abundant Chan texts marked the revival of Chan Buddhism in the early Qing Dynasty. Divided into two major lineages (Caodong and Linji), Chan Buddhists frequently used âencounter dialoguesâ and the act of beating and shouting to express their understanding of awakening. Chan Buddhism emphasizes intuition over textual study, the role of meditation in cultivating oneâs mind, and the importance of master-disciple relationship in the transmission of dharma. Chan Buddhists affiliated with the same lineage were loosely organized as a group as shown in the documental evidence of dharma transmission. The Chan Buddhists disputed with each other about the criteria of enlightenment and the authenticity of the lineages of dharma transmission in their textual works, which stimulated the revival of Chan Buddhism in the seventeenth century. The religious group not only includes elite Chan Buddhists who authored voluminous works, but also common Buddhists and lay people who practiced Chan.",1600,1700,1087,789,Nan Ouyang,45,Matthew Hamm,2020-08-04 18:56:04.612 +0200,2021-09-29 20:43:09.513 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.007984340874879418,0.18814626174363694,0.04256200870791868,0.291639863651091,0.0010683019646819932,3.7513771563119254e-13,0.17346395547852908,0.1415198068572762,0.15361546072161136
942,African Methodist Episcopal Church,43,Religious Group (v6),"In 1787, roughly a decade after Americaâs independence from Great Britain and almost a century before Black Americans were guaranteed U.S. citizenship, a group of Black congregants walked out of Philadelphiaâs primarily white St. George's Methodist Episcopal Church in the middle of the Sunday service. One of these protesters, Black Methodist minister Richard Allen, eventually founded Americaâs first independent Black denomination and its oldest formal Black institutionâthe African Methodist Episcopal Church. Described by W.E.B. Du Bois as the worldâs âgreatest Negro organization,â the AME Church is a Protestant Christian denomination aligned doctrinally with the United Methodist Church and organized in an Episcopal system. 

To tell the story of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, one must first turn to the history of Methodism, its antecedent. Originated by English minister John Wesley, the transatlantic denomination became ubiquitous in eighteenth and early nineteenth-century America through the revivals of the First and Second Great Awakening. Historians often remark on the egalitarian and democratic nature of these revivals. While it is important for us not to romanticize early Methodism, thereby ignoring Black people's experiences of discrimination and systemic racism within the religious culture and society more broadly, we can still recognize that some enslaved people managed to make a home for themselves within the Methodist fold and, to some extent, were even accepted into communal worship spaces. The fact that services were held in large, open-air fields created a come-one, come-all atmosphere, and ecstatic, embodied worship experiences were customary. It was into this Methodist culture that Richard Allen was converted as a seventeen-year-old enslaved person in 1777. And ten years later, when he led a group of Black Methodists out of St. George's, it was as a consequence of this Methodist culture that he protested. 

While the Methodism to which Allen had been introduced as a young man was more open to Black congregants, the religious culture he experienced at the turn of the eighteenth century was increasingly stratified by race. Although sizable numbers of Blacks had been evangelized by Methodists and even licensed to preach in the mid-1700s, white Methodists started to neglect earlier ideals of acceptance in lieu of pursuing respectability and becoming an established church. Among other practices, white Methodists began to deny Black members leadership roles within the denomination and some white Methodist preachers even refused to hold Black babies during infant baptisms, as historian Julius H. Bailey has shown. Separating from St. George's signified Allenâs rejection of the inequitable treatment of African Americans in Methodist spaces, his recovery of early Methodismâs egalitarian ideals and his articulation of a new religious vision that embraced the humanity of Black Americans. After starting a church of his own in 1794 (Mother Bethel AME), Allen and a collective of other Black Methodists established their own denomination in 1816 with Allen as the organizationâs first Bishop. 

Commitments to racial justice and what twentieth-century AME minister and theologian James H. Cone would later name Black liberation theology have served as the cornerstones of the two-hundred-year-old denomination. In the antebellum period, AME churches served as posts for the Underground Railroad. During Reconstruction, Northern AME missionaries travelled southward to teach formerly enslaved people how to read. Today, AME churches provide community programming that, according to their mission statement, aims to âenhance the entire social development of all people.â Furthermore, missionization, particularly in Africa, has been a primary component of the churchâs work, leading to the establishment of the denomination in over thirty countries.",1816,2020,1095,804,MÃ©lena Laudig,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-04 23:10:43.804 +0200,2020-08-18 20:03:51.195 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),7.829830825526338e-05,0.05625981671840208,1.5269832741509745e-15,0.15261722731893193,1.81663742168168e-05,7.564080753386075e-13,3.9065951003283914e-05,0.715340567523567,0.07564685780486556
943,Moravian Missionaries in Nunatsiavut,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Moravian Church or the Unitas Fratrum, originated in early 15th century Bohemia, in what is now the Czech Republic. Moravians were the first large-scale Protestant Missionary movement, spreading across the globe. Missionary work, ecumenism, personal piety and an emphasis on liturgical music and worship are tenets of the Moravian faith. This entry focuses on Moravian Missionaries in Nunatsiavut, the Inuit self-governing region of northern Labrador. It tracks social changes along several centuries of occupation, as well as how Inuit resisted and accomodated Moravian beliefs and sociality. Moravians first journeyed to Labrador in 1752, after Johann Christiann Erhardt, a newly converted seaman, traveled to Greenland, where Moravians had started to evangelize Inuit in 1733, using to their advantage the connections to the Danish court of their leader Count Nikolaus Ludwig Zinzendorf (1700-1760). Erhardt became convinced that he would be able to communicate with and interact with Inuit across the Strait in British North America after reading travel accounts depicting Inuit in Labrador. The first attempt to establish a mission in Nisbet's Harbour failed, with members of the expedition supposedly killed. In 1771, the first permanent Moravian community is established on the Labrador Coast and called Nain, and soon follows a mission station at Okak in 1776, and Agvituk (now known as Hopedale) in 1777. Missionaries chose locations to set up stations based on Inuit hunting, fishing, and whaling grounds, hoping that establishing themselves near historical winter camps would encourage Inuit to ""settle"" near them. This ""settling"" was instrumental to the conversion process. It allowed missionaries to keep watch over Inuit, encourage them to attend Church and festivals, and gave them a large amount of control over the flow of European goods. Control over trade meant control over Inuit subsistence activities, as Inuit converts were obligated to participate in the Moravian cod and fur economy, rather than spending their time hunting whale and caribou, which Moravians discouraged. In 1831, a mission station was established at Hebron, located 80 miles north of Okak, in 1865 a mission station was established at Zoar south of Nain, in 1871 a sixth station was established at Ramah (it would be closed in 1907), in 1896 a mission station was established at Makkovik, and in 1904 the eighth and final Moravian mission station opened at Killinek, at the northern tip of Labrador. The Moravian missions in Labrador struggled financially throughout its history. Events that stand out include the 1918 Spanish Flu in Labrador, which killed more people proportionally in Nunatsiavut than anywhere else on earth, with a mortality rate of 71% at Okak and Hebron. The Spanish Flu was brought to Labrador by way of the annual Mission supply ship and spread rampantly through the coast. Because of the remoteness of the Labrador coast, missionaries served as doctors and administrators, as the governmental presence was minimal. Moravians, along with the provincial government, ran the residential schools in the region and were responsible for intense physical, sexual, and psychological trauma of Inuit children during the mid-late 19th century. The last missionary left Nunatsiavut in 2005, the same year that the region became self-governing. Community members continue to carry on certain Moravian traditions and many self-identify as Moravian, serving as ministers in their own communities. Many Nunatsiavut Inuit have also called for there to be a reckoning with the colonial violence inflicted by Moravian missionaries, particularly surrounding residential schools. Youth have also taken up the cause for a re-evaluation of Moravian presence in Nunatsiavut. There is currently a youth-led movement to change the name of schools on the coast named for Moravian missionaries such as Jens Haven Memorial School in Nain and Amos Comenius in Hopedale.",1752,2020,1091,788,Emma Gilheany,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-05 04:18:23.682 +0200,2020-08-16 18:31:47.681 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.001436389408412549,0.04349245456468567,2.4205253401043623e-15,0.09946488263213588,0.004850084416834748,0.6940968980955915,0.00022582137595037981,0.15643341393136986,5.557501699752987e-08
944,Mohyla's Ukrainian Church,43,Religious Group (v6),"A community of Orthodox believers in Ukraine who abide to the standards and practices of the Orthodox religion renewed in the course of Petro Mohyla's (1597-1647) reforms in the seventeenth century. Petro Mohylaâs reforms were motivated by religious competition in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.
In the 1620s, aristocratic dynasties that traditionally supported the Orthodox Church in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth either converted to Catholicism, or disappeared. However, the Orthodox Church in Ukraine, received a new supporter in the figure of the Cossacks, armed men of diverse social backgrounds. In 1620, the Cossacks helped to elect a new metropolitan for the part of the Orthodox Church that did not recognize the superiority of the Pope. In 1632, the Polish king recognized equal rights between the restored Orthodox Church and the Uniate, Catholic and Protestant Churches of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1633, Peter Mohyla, an energetic scion of an aristocratic Moldavian family, became the head of the Kyivan Orthodox Church.
Mohylaâs tenure as the metropolitan marked the beginning of an important period in the history of the Ukrainian and Belorussian Church, characterized by reforms in religion and education. The learned circle of Petro Mohyla modernized the existing theological literature and introduced new genres such as collections of miracles and moral theology into the Orthodox use. To unify the liturgy and teaching of the Orthodox Church, Mohyla initiated a revision and publication of the âcritical editionsâ of the main books of the Church such as the and the Missal (1629), the Orthodox Confession of Faith (1640), the Euchologion (1646). Trying to raise the status of the Orthodox Church in the Commonwealth, Mohyla and his circle closely followed the Catholic example of ecclesiastical modernization and even made steps to prepare the Orthodox Church in Ukraine for the second Union with the Catholic Church. Mohyla justified using Latin sources by saying that âthere exist few Slavonic books on theology, and none at all on politics. Greek books are difficult to obtain, and they cost too much, while Latin books on these subjects are readily available (Charipova, 261). To address the problem of education, Mohyla founded the Kyivan Collegium modeled on the example of Jesuit academies in the Commonwealth in 1632. Changes in religious life also brought transformations in the religious art and architecture. New genres of theatrical plays on religious became popular and popularized by the Kyivan Collegium. The new influences became noticeable in iconography that emphasized the cult of the Mother of God and Marian piety.  
The followers of Petro Mohyla accepted fundamental works created during Mohylaâs timeline and developed new theological genres. The most prominent works produced by the generation that followed  Mohyla included collections of sermons by Lazar Baranovych (1620-1693), treatises on moral theology by Innocentyi Gizel (1600-1683), collections of miracles by Ioanykyi Galiatovsâkyi (1620-1688). This generation of religious scholars made a considerable influence on the Russian Orthodox Church by bringing new types of books to Russian markets and setting new standards for education, preaching and church discipline.",1620,1700,1101,812,Ievgeniia Sakal,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-05 06:13:18.219 +0200,2020-08-10 00:56:11.375 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.02691067746601527,0.22216655223845458,3.3062183890423034e-14,0.2637244805362154,0.0032256527984707043,0.08550406790359173,0.3799154007204371,0.018553134863443524,3.3473338733937465e-08
948,Christianity in Ephesus,43,Religious Group (v6),"Groups of Jesus-followers (aka ""Christians"") in the city of Ephesus and its environs, in the second and third centuries of the Common Era, prior to the official recognition of Christianity as a state-sanctioned religious group. The earliest Jesus movement missionary connected with Ephesus is Paul, who is said to have resided in Ephesus in the mid-1st century CE and who provides evidence for an early ""church"" there. In the second century, traditions developed identifying a spot on the nearby Ayasoluk Hill as the burial place of apostle John; there developed a tomb cult that would eventually become an important Christian holy site and pilgrimage destination. By the end of the third century, Ephesus had grown into a central hub of the burgeoning Christian movement, famous for its associations with the apostles Paul and John, presaging its later place among the civic centers of imperial Christianity. 
Besides Paulâs letters, other early Christian texts connected with Ephesus include the pseudo-Pauline Pastoral Epistles, the Johannine Epistles, the Acts of the Apostles, the Book of Revelation, Ignatius' Letter to the Ephesians, and the apocryphal Acts of John. The latter two sources are our best witnesses to second century Christianity in the area, though the contested provenance of the Acts of John renders its historical utility dubious. Collectively, our sources for early Christianity in Ephesus attest to a substantial, though still marginal, presence of Christian groups in the city in the first three centuries. Almost all of our earliest sources attest to conflict between groups associated with the city, suggesting that Christianity there was comprised of a diverse collection of groups. 
The partial and highly stylized nature of our earliest sources, however, frustrate attempts to discern reliable sociological information, especially whether and how Ephesian Christians were distinct from other Christian groups, Jews, and Greco-Roman polytheists. Scholars have sometimes suggested that an early Pauline strand of Christianity was ""overtaken"" by a competing Johannine tradition (see DRH entries on ""Pauline"" and ""Johannine"" Christianities for more on these groups), but our sources prevent any kind of clarity on that front. Utilizing material and literary evidence, Katherine Shaner has recently suggested that women and enslaved people played prominent roles in the earliest Christian communities in Ephesus. 
This entry combines reconstructions of general early Christian beliefs and practices (in all their diversity), supplemented by insights drawn from texts connected specifically with Ephesian history and culture.",120,300,1094,807,Travis Proctor,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-05 22:58:22.825 +0200,2020-08-06 15:57:01.539 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.001436389408412549,0.04349245456468567,2.4205253401043623e-15,0.09946488263213588,0.004850084416834748,0.6940968980955915,0.00022582137595037981,0.15643341393136986,5.557501699752987e-08
950,The Religious Society of Friends,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Religious Society of Friends (Quakers)
The Religious Society of Friends, better known by the once derogatory and later reclaimed moniker âQuakers,â are a historically Christian group. One of many small religious sects to emerge in the wake of the English Civil War, the Quakers formed under the inspiration of the teachings of George Fox, a weaver turned preacher who elevated the âpriesthood of the believerâ to a hitherto unseen extreme. Fox argued for the abolition of the priesthood (or the laity, as Friends might say), in favor of a Christian community modeled on Foxâs understanding of the early church, one in which all were called to ministry and equally able to communicate with a divine âLight Within.â Fox and the early Friends seem to have been a premillenarian sect who felt Christâs return was immanent and prepared accordingly, but by the 1670s the Friends had begun to internalize the second coming and institutionalize in earnest. Friends became notorious throughout England for the uniqueness of their theological and social practicesâworshipping in silence, eschewing paid ministers and tithes, refusing to use the âpaganâ names of months and days, adopting plain clothes and the informal âthouâ in place of the honorific âyou,â refusing to doff hats for anyone but the Lord, and, most importantly, their refusal to swear oaths in courts of law (after Matthew 5:34) which led to their frequent imprisonment.
Even after the Friends were granted formal toleration in the Toleration Act of 1689, a number chose to immigrate to the New World, driven by economic and religious motivations. Though Friends began arriving in the Americas as early as 1655, they founded their most influential settlement in Pennsylvania (awarded as a charter to Quaker William Penn in 1681 to repay a lien owed his father), where Friends remained the dominant force in the legislature until 1756, when they resigned en masse rather than dedicate taxes for the French and Indian War, objecting on pacifist grounds. Though never a numerically significant portion of the American population, Friends assumed outsized importance in American religious history by spearheading a variety of social movements: The American abolition movement, womenâs suffrage, Native American rights, and pacifist movements all have Quaker origins and inspirations.
A series of schisms split the American Quakers in the nineteenth century, following the trajectory of many Protestant denominations at the time. The most significant was the 1827 Orthodox-Hicksite split, the Hicksites rallying around the teachings of Elias Hicks, who taught that Jesus became Christ but was not born divine, and that any modern Friend who might follow Jesusâ example in discerning the will of the Inward Light within all. For Hicks, the Bible was valuable as one source among many attesting to Godâs previous revelations but was not the unique word of God and should be subordinated to reason and experience. Orthodox Friends, by contrast, affirmed the traditional Christian beliefs that Christ was the sole Son of God who was sent to earth to redeem humanity by dying on the cross. Orthodox Friends increasingly integrated with other Protestant denominations in both theology and practice, while Hicksite Friends grew closer with other progressive denominations active in social movements. The split foreran the two most important Quaker bodies today, the liberal Friends General Conference (FGC) and evangelical Friends United Meeting (FUM). FGC Friends have maintained the distinctively quiet (âunprogrammedâ) style of Quaker worship but are arguably post-Christian, while FUM meetings are effectively Protestant. The two groups share little with one another except competing claims to a shared spiritual lineage and the Quaker name itself. 
The Quakers were not historically known for missions after their initial proselytization efforts in the seventeenth century, but a series of successful international missions initiated in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries have led to large Quaker communities in Kenya, Burundi, Guatemala, and Bolivia. These international meetings are typically, though not invariably, affiliated with either the Evangelical Friends or the Friends United Meeting, and so more closely resemble other Protestant Christian churches than the more liberal FGC Friends. Over a third of the worldâs Quakers live in Kenya, the likely provenance of the next stage of Quaker history.",1652,2020,1125,803,Andrew Taylor,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-06 18:03:17.959 +0200,2023-02-27 17:07:01.866 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),4.0654020198817436e-19,4.042561919308323e-15,0.007280171620271628,1.1203751184901787e-13,0.002064277845894991,2.7237421395214638e-36,2.3151087722382697e-08,1.7584238983176998e-23,0.9906555273826296
953,Sachchai,43,Religious Group (v6),"Sachchai is a loosely organized group of believers who aim to heal their suffering and illnesses through the means of Bible study, ritual exorcism, and speaking in tongue. Sachchai is rapidly spreading across villages and towns in Nepal. Hundreds of thousands of believers have embraced it. More than ninety percent of the believers are women who mostly are from poor and low-caste backgrounds. Sachchai claims to be an inclusive, egalitarian, and universal group. People from any religious and cultural background are welcome and they do not need to abandon their past religions and cultures. But the believers are required to believe in Jesus and study the Bible. Other synchretist faith-based groups like Sachchai are also found in South Asia. For example, Christ-Bhakta followers in Tamil Nadu, India, who identify themselves as Christ-Bhakta Hindus, and Jesus Imandars in Bangladesh, who identify themselves as Isa-Muslims (JÃ¸rgensen 2008; Kuttiyanikkal 2014) . Both these groups study the Bible but do not disassociate themselves from their past religions.   

Sachchai was established by Christian evangelicals in the late 1970s in India but could not prosper until the first decade of the 21st century when it got fertile ground in Nepal. Extreme political instabilities, huge international labor migration of men, dire lack of public services, and, most importantly, rising domestic violence against women, all have contributed to the rapid expansion of Sachchai.

957,Spartan Religion,43,Religious Group (v6),"Ancient Spartans, known also as Spartiates, lived in the city of Sparta, a settlement located in the region of southwest Greece known as the âPeloponnesosâ. Positioned between the between the Eurotas River and the Taygetos mountains, Sparta during the Archaic and Classical periods controlled a large territory that included the regions of Lakonia and Messenia. Having subjugated the native populations of these regions during a series of conflicts thought to have taken place during the 8th-7th centuries BCE, the Spartans instituted a systemâattributed to the quasi-mythical Spartan lawgiver Lycurgusâby which a small caste of full-citizen Spartiates were supported by the unfree agricultural and commercial labor of oppressed non-Spartan inhabitants of Lakonia and Messenia (known as âperioikoiâ and âhelotsâ). Uniquely unconstrained by agricultural or economic obligations, Spartiate males devoted the majority of their time to rigorous physical and military training from the age of seven onwards. The educational system at Sparta, supposedly another Lycurgan initiative, specialized in the cultivation of civic and martial virtues such as bravery, obedience, and self-control, as well as physical prowess and mental acumen; physical training for Spartiate women also existed to promote the generation of strong and healthy children. As a result of this system, the Spartans maintained one of the most powerful and respected armies in all of Greece during the Archaic and Classical periods, and it is this martial aspect of Spartan society that remains most well-known today. || 

Beyond the reputation of the Spartans as formidable warriors, however, many aspects of Spartan society remain shrouded in mystery. Little written evidence regarding Archaic and Classical Sparta has survived unto the present day, and of the ancient sources that do survive, very few of them record contemporary Spartan perspectives. FranÃ§ois Ollier first coined the term âle mirage Spartiateâ to describe this conundrum of attempting to reconstruct Spartan society from the testimony of outsider perspectives, most of which postdate the period in question and present an idealized account of Spartan society. Much of the ancient evidence concerning Sparta comes either from the period of Roman Greece, when Sparta was greatly admired by the Roman Empire, or from the 5th century BCE, when Sparta and Athens were locked in a struggle for the supremacy of Greece. Fueled by the ideological conflict and the perceived insularity of âconservativeâ Spartan society, 5th-century Athenian writers tended to project their feelings about Athensâwhether positive or negativeâonto the antithetical âblank canvasâ of Spartan society. || 

If reconstructing Spartan society remains a difficult task on its own terms, then reconstructing Spartan religion is even more challenging due to the scarcity of written evidence and the strong localizing tendencies of Greek religion. During the Archaic and Classical periods, each city-state in the Greek world practiced its own expression of a more universal âGreek religionâ. Deeply embedded in a city-stateâs civic institutions, these so-called âpolis religionsâ fused local religious traditions with aspects of Panhellenic belief and practice. In reconstructing Spartan ritual practices and festivals, every attempt has been made to temper the accounts of later writers such as Pausanias and Plutarch by turning to the testimony of archaeological evidence, particularly that excavated from Spartan sanctuaries and shrines under the auspices of the British School at Athens. In the absence of -emic sources concerning Spartan religious beliefs and cosmology, much of this material has been reconstructed from the testimony of early Greek poets such as Homer and Hesiod. ||",-800,-300,1142,809,Sarah M.

958,Society of Jesus,43,Religious Group (v6),"Revered and reviled. Saints or devils incarnate. These and other stark dichotomies have dogged the Jesuits throughout their nearly five-century history. That history was born with a second birth; that is, the conversion of a Basque nobleman after the battle of Pamplona in 1521. A cannonball struck the knees of IÃ±igo Lopez shattering them and his hopes for a career as a courtier. Yet, instead of crippling him, the injuries he sustained transported him into a whole new life, the life of the spirit. His meandering path in the life of religion brought him to unexpected places from Montserrat, to Jerusalem, to Barcelona, to Paris and ultimately to Rome; and to a surprising destiny: the founder and first Superior General of a religious order, the Society of Jesus.
Paul III officially approved of the Society on September 27, 1540 and in so doing ratified their first formula and institute in which the Jesuits laid out the plan for their common life. In that document the Jesuits commit themselves to a wide variety of ministries of the word including giving the Spiritual Exercises, striving for the progress of souls, partaking in works of charity, educating children and the illiterate. In addition to these pursuits, the Jesuits took a special fourth vow, beyond the three traditional evangelical vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, of obedience to the pope to undertake missions anywhere in the world. It was in these latter two capacities that the Jesuits became most famous. 
As the Society rapidly grew from ten to one thousand from 1540 to 1556 so too did its commitment to education. While they were involved in some form of teaching from the outset, their first formal foray into schooling for primarily lay students began in 1548 with the foundation of their school at Messina, Sicily. After that date, schools quickly sprang up in nearly every city where there were Jesuits, and practically every place that did not have a Jesuit school wanted one. Devoted to a rigorous humanist education in the classics, grammar, rhetoric, and other burgeoning arts such as history, while maintaining their instruction in faith and good morals the Jesuits became the teachers par excellence of the early modern period. Indeed, students of the caliber of Moliere, Voltaire, Descartes, and many other attended their schools, which helped earn them their reputation for educational excellence. Even contemporaries, such as Francis Bacon, commended the Jesuit efforts in education in his own writings on education reform.  
Their schools were not limited to the confines of Europe. In fact, schooling was a major part of their missionary endeavors where they taught both Europeans and indigenous populations alike. The Jesuits were adept missionaries, with a unique style of accommodation. Their educational background in languages encouraged them to learn the languages of indigenous populations and prepare grammar books for those languages in an effort to teach others. Jesuits explored and frequently wrote about the new cultures they interacted with as well as the new environments, flora, and fauna they encountered. As a result, they published many ethnographies, but also letters that they sent on an annual basis to Rome, known as the Jesuit Relations. These letters electrified European audiences thirsting for knowledge of faraway lands and inspired many young men to become Jesuits. 
Outside of these two ventures the Jesuits also excelled in preaching, the study of theology, and even as patrons of the arts. They produced some of the greatest theologians of the time including Francisco Suarez and Robert Bellarmine. Similarly, they had relationships with the greatest artists of the day such as Michelangelo, Bernini, and even numbered the great painter and art theorist Andrea Pozzo among their own.
Still, wherever the Jesuits succeeded they also seemed to draw harsh criticism. This was especially true in their missionary endeavors where detractors accused them of using the mission fields for the purpose of acquiring land and riches. Similarly, as theologians, many of their ideas became controversial. Dominicans and later Jansenists (including Pascal) accused them of neo-Pelagianism on account of their insistence on the role of free will in salvation. 
These criticisms, added to various political intrigues, fueled the flames that eventually led to the general suppression of the Society of Jesus in 1773. Over the two hundred and thirty three year history of the âOld Societyâ the Jesuits achieved many major accomplishments and earned the ire of many detractors. To some they were saints to others devils incarnate. They were reviled as much as revered.",1540,1773,498,799,Thomas Santa Maria,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-08 02:16:19.454 +0200,2020-09-14 17:16:30.487 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.0003036857640932551,0.026341806773536147,1.778897188823537e-15,0.033433137816339595,0.00013187420492354575,2.2090623598624163e-12,6.549260936274293e-05,0.9113341694201208,0.02838983340941306
961,Romanian Orthodox Church,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Romanian Orthodox Church (henceforth ROC) is an Eastern Christian denomination. It represents the largest religious group in Romania (86.45% in 2011). Although the first evidence of Christianization of modern-day Romanian territories (Lower Moesia) dates back to the 3rd century, this entryâs time span runs from the achievement of the status of autocephalous Metropolis of Romania in 1885 â following the creation of the Kingdom of Romania in 1881 â up to the present day. The Metropolis of Romania was eventually raised to the rank of Patriarchate (its current jurisdiction) in 1925. The ROC is structured in Romania (thus excluding its dioceses abroad) into twenty-nine dioceses, fourteen of which have been established since 1990 (seven have been just re-opened after the communist leadership had disbanded them and another seven have been newly established). The Patriarch is the head and representative of the Romanian Orthodox Church, but decision making is the prerogative of the Holy Synod, which meets twice per year. The Holy Synod, which is the highest authority of the ROC, is formed by six Metropolitanates, sixteen Archbishoprics and thirteen Bishoprics with jurisdiction in Romania, plus some representatives for Romanian Orthodox communities abroad, including the Republic of Moldova. On a local scale, Bishoprics and Archbishoprics are divided in Protopopiates and, eventually, in parishes, which are the smallest units (Tateo 2020: 62).
The theological framework organizing the orthodoxy and the orthopraxis of the ROC is the same of the other eight Eastern Orthodox churches, which are all autocephalous but in full communion with one another. The Romanian Orthodox faithful worship with particular devotion Saint Nicholas, Saint Parascheva, Saint Filofteia, Saint Andrew, Saint George, Saints Constantin and Elena, and Saint Dimitrie. The Orthodox Easter is the most important feast day of the year, while weekly services revolve around the Sunday mass. Pilgrimage to monasteries is a crucial form of religious practice which gathers thousands of believers every year: the Saint Parascheva is the largest one and takes place at the Metropolitan Cathedral of IaÅi on October 14th. The most popular Orthodox monasteries in Romania are Putna, MoldoviÅ£a, SuceviÅ£a, VoroneÅ£, Prislop, Cernica, and Sihastria.

963,The Knights Templar,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Knights Templars, or the Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon, were a Christian religious military order founded in the early twelfth century whose history is inextricably linked to the crusades. Originally founded to protect pilgrims visiting the Holy Land in the decades after the First Crusade from danger as they crossed through Muslim-controlled areas, the organisation soon expanded its duties. The orderâs knights, those men who were highly skilled in military warfare (at most around 10%), came to play an important role in the defence of the Crusader States, while non-combatant members managed a large economic structure throughout Christendom, making use of innovative banking techniques. 

All took vows of poverty, chastity and obedience, and promised to devote themselves to God's service just as members of other religious orders did. Its constitution guaranteed the organisationâs structure form the mid-twelfth century onwards, at the top of which stood the Grand Master, initially stationed in Jerusalem (while under Christian control) and later in Acre. He was elected for life and assisted by other high-ranking members, including the Grand Commander and Marshal. Directly below were the provincial preceptors of the Templar territories who commanded the sergeants (or 'servientes'), non-elite members who had usually joined from the lower social classes and supported the knights on the battlefield or served as craftsmen or labourers. There were also priest-brothers within the Order who were responsible for the spiritual needs of all members. Both elite and non-elite members came from all over western Europe. 

They initially found support among many secular and religious leaders, who made significant donations to the order in aid of their cause, thereby allowing the order to grow significantly and acquire great wealth. However, the tide began to turn at the end of the thirteenth century. At the end of the thirteenth century, little remained of the Crusader States which had been established nearly two centuries earlier and many resented the orderâs significant power. Finally, in 1307 King Philip IV of France order the arrest of every Templar in France, falsely accusing them of immorality and heresy. This move gained the support of Pope Clement V and led to the violent persecution and death of many members.",1119,1312,1110,811,Emma ZÃ¼rcher,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-09 14:11:33.811 +0200,2020-08-13 15:12:27.359 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),7.829830825526338e-05,0.05625981671840208,1.5269832741509745e-15,0.15261722731893193,1.81663742168168e-05,7.564080753386075e-13,3.9065951003283914e-05,0.715340567523567,0.07564685780486556
964,Baul Fakirs of Bengal,43,Religious Group (v6),"Baul Fakir (Bengali: bÄul phakir) is a phrase used to describe decentralized and non-sectarian communities of sadhus, fakirs, and artists who most often come from either Hindu (most often Vaiá¹£á¹ava but sometimes Åaiva or ÅÄkta) and Muslim families.

BÄul Fakirs are generally decentralized as a society, and authority is organized according to various lines of descent from a guru or murshid (both guru and murshid are used synonymously among BÄul Fakirs). Gurus, their students, and their devotees (bhaktas) meet together during periodic gatherings called sÄdhusaá¹ga, âgathering of adepts,â where formal meals are held and decisions are often made on various issues of interest to the wider community of Fakirs (also called sÄdhaks or sÄdhus) and FakirÄnis (also called sÄdhikÄs); these gatherings are often not only attended by BÄuls but also Hindu Tantric practitioners (tÄntrikÄs) and followers of Sufi pÄ«rs.

BÄul Fakirs of all stripes are distinguished by their great reverence for the songs of LÄlan Fakir (d. 1890, also commonly rendered Lalon Sai or Lalon Shah). LÄlan is especially known for his criticism of sectarian religion or âbirth groupâ (jÄt) in his songs, early versions of which were later committed to writing and recorded in the notebooks of the celebrated poet and Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore (1861-1941). However, respect is also accorded to other important BÄul Fakiri poets, such as PÄÃ±ju KhondakÄr (1851-1914, also PÄÃ±ju ÅÄh), an associate of LÄlanâs who seems to have contributed to the latterâs understanding of Islamic esoteric themes as well as his musical style of bhÄb-saá¹gÄ«t âmusic for reflection.â The songs of Duddu Shah (1841-1911), one of LÄlanâs direct disciples, as well as those of a wide variety of other artists as well as independent compositions are also commonly performed, but LÄlanâs songs are often given preeminence at most festivals in Bangladesh, due in large part to his cultural status and familiarity. In West Bengal, however, the tradition appears to be more decentralized, and the songs of other BÄul poets such as BhabÄ PÄglÄ (d. 1984) and RÄj KrÌ¥á¹£á¹a (1869-1946) as well as independent compositions are at least as prevalent as the songs of LÄlan.

The lyrics of BÄul songs accordingly contain references not only to Hindu PurÄá¹as but also to Sufi themes or symbols that relate to striving for the attainment (siddhi) of embodied self-realization, and to this end refer to practices as varied as reflecting on cosmology as expressed in terms of the Arabic alphabet and privately practicing sexual rites derived from medieval Tantric literature and syncretic oral tradition. The emphasis on the physical body has also led some scholars to view the community as having much in common with LokÄyata and CÄrvÄka beliefs on materialism.",1800,2020,1111,776,Keith Cantu,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-09 21:01:56.144 +0200,2020-08-17 23:18:27.243 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.018328848804072935,2.0496713832748494e-09,1.9781959082025022e-13,0.0870011853784552,3.5481898207695147e-15,1.1357256021231834e-23,0.8146003869491453,0.07301654077631252,0.007053036042141342
965,Pachomian Monasticism,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Pachomian monastic federation was a group of ultimately eleven monasteries, including two women's monasteries, affiliated under centralized leadership in Upper Egypt in the fourth to sixth centuries CE.  

The founder and central figure, Pachomius (c. 292-346), was born to a pagan family.  During his time serving in the Roman imperial army, he was inspired by the kind treatment he received from Christians, and ultimately embarked on an ascetic life.  He apprenticed himself to a local ascetic, after whose death he began his own community of ascetics.  After an unsuccessful first attempt, he established a monastery at Tabennesi (c. 323), the first of the monasteries that either were established or joined his federation over the course of the fourth century.  

After Pachomiusâs death, there was a struggle to establish succession, but ultimately two more strong leaders, Theodore (d. 368) and Horsiesius (d. c. 387), took the reins and kept the federation thriving during their lifetimes.  Most of the primary source material we have dates to these eras.  We have much less data concerning the following century and a half, but the Pachomian federation appears to have continued during this period.  Sometime between 537 and 548, the Roman emperor Justinian I supplanted the Monophysite Pachomian leader Abraham with a Chalcedonian replacement, at which time many monks fled, effectively ending the existence of the Pachomian community.  

This group is sometimes described as the first Christian cenobitic monastic community, but this characterization is not strictly correct.  It was certainly the largest and most organized up to its time, but many others had been practicing a semi-removed ascetic and communal lifestyle for years already. For example, at least three of the eleven monasteries in the federation were not founded by the Pachomians, but joined the federation after independent origins.  The federationâs innovation instead came in its extensive organization in part facilitated by the Pachomian Rule, which provided a practical guide that helped in the regulation and functioning of the community.

The Pachomian legacyâs lasting influence is seen in other Christian cenobitic enterprises including Shenouteâs monastic community in Upper Egypt and Benedict of Nursiaâs monastic Rule.",323,548,1112,818,Tola Rodrick,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-09 22:30:33.638 +0200,2020-08-18 00:31:58.385 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),1.1566194132941026e-05,0.04823464501674903,3.915087721829286e-15,0.024314994566629777,0.0013906369500424481,1.4102099349190877e-12,5.062293243305799e-06,0.834907626491756,0.09113546848603242
966,"NaqshbandÄ« Order, NaqshbandÄ« TarÄ«qa, NaqshbandÄ«yyah, KhwÄjagÄn,",43,Religious Group (v6),"The NaqshbandÄ« Order refers to a range of Sufi brotherhoods beginning in Central Asia in the 14th century c.e. and spreading geographically through offshoots such as the NaqshbandÄ« MujaddidÄ« in South Asia during the 17th century and the KhÃ¢lidÄ« branches beginning in the 19th century within the Ottoman Empire. The namesake of the order BahÄÊ¾ al-DÄ«n Naqshband was born in 1318 c.e. and died in 1389 c.e. in a village near Bukhara known as Qasr Ê¿ÄrifÄn and studied under the KhwÄjagÄn Sufi master AmÄ«r Kulal. One of the common identifying features that distinguish NaqshbandÄ« order from others is itâs Silsila, or the chain of transmission of its teachings. While most Sufi orders trace the chain of transmission from the prophet Muá¸¥ammad through the fourth Caliph and first ShÄ«Ê¿Ä« imam âAlÄ« ibn Ê¾AbÄ« á¹¬Älib, the Naqshbandi trace their teaching through the first Caliph Abu Bakr Al-á¹¢adÄ«q. This is known as the NaqshbandÄ« âGolden Chainâ (Ar. Silsilat al-dhahab). Another unique feature of NaqshbandÄ« orders is the practice of âsilent recitation of Godâs nameâ (dhikr-khafÄ«) also known as âdhikr of the heartâ (dhikr al-qalb) as opposed to âvocal dhikr (dhikr-i jahrÄ«)â or âdhikr of the tongueâ (dhikr al-lisan). The practice of silent dhikr combined with an aversion to musical audition (samÄÊ¿) represent the âsoberâ rather than âintoxicatedâ expression of Sufism that characterizes the NaqshbandÄ« orders. Finally, the NaqshbandÄ« orders are characterized by a tendency toward social and political engagement. This is articulated in BahÄâ al-DÄ«n Naqshbandâs preference for âcompanionshipâ (suhbat) over isolation (khalwat), and the principle of âsolitude in the crowdâ (Per. khalwat dar anjuman) which stressed that followers need not abandon their trades or economic activity for the sake of spiritual pursuits reflecting a Malamati Sufi attitude toward âlivelihoodâ (kasb) prevalent in Central Asia. Along with another of Naqhbandâs eleven principles--âtravelling in oneâs homelandâ (safr dar watn)--Naqshbandi Sufis were encouraged to actively engage in society which may be seen from  âUbaydullah Ahrarâs (1404-1490) land-holdings and influence in Timurid politics, to the prominent role of the Naqshbandiyya-Khalidiyya in resisting the Russian Empireâs expansion into the Caucasus during the 18th and 19th centuries.",1318,2020,1113,757,Adam Tyson,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-10 08:42:31.607 +0200,2020-08-15 02:25:38.942 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.0001292661243768821,0.03552549033979407,2.757845774559183e-13,8.133814418899848e-12,0.9643089486035962,1.1981817444082695e-22,3.628221105736153e-05,1.7459184886698533e-22,1.2712765783123961e-08
968,"Anabaptist Mennonites in North America, 1683-2021",43,Religious Group (v6),"Mennonites are a religious group that arose out of the Radical Reformation of the broader Protestant Reformation in Western Europe in the early sixteenth century. They were called Anabaptists, ârebaptizers,â by religious and political authorities who persecuted them for baptizing adults upon their confession of faith rather than baptizing infants, which was the legislated practice of the time. In north Germany and the Netherlands, Roman Catholic priest Menno Simons renounced his position in 1536 and became an influential Anabaptist leader. Mennonites take their name from him.

Anabaptist Mennonites fled persecution and migrated throughout Western Europe. Mennonites in the Swiss and south German territories fled further west into Germany and France, and in 1683 the first group immigrated to North America in Germantown, Pennsylvania. Many more followed, finding the Quaker William Pennâs offers of land and religious freedom appealing. The north German and Dutch Mennonites fled further east in a later wave of migration during this time. Mennonite migration to Canada occurred in the late 18th century from Pennsylvania in southern Ontario due to the Revolutionary War, as Mennonites generally hold strong convictions about practicing nonviolence. In the late nineteenth century, Russian Mennonites migrated to Kansas, Nebraska and Manitoba. In the early twentieth century, some Canadian Mennonites migrated to Mexico.

Anabaptist Mennonites range from conservative to progressive. Those on the most conservative end have isolated themselves from the surrounding culture to the extent of not driving cars or using electricity, dressing in distinctive homemade attire and maintaining their own language (often, a low German dialect called Pennsylvania Dutch). Those on the most progressive end interact with the surrounding society to the point of not being recognizably different, participating in government leadership and undergoing training at non-Mennonite public and private educational institutions. 

Mennonites in North America today live in nearly every state and province. They typically share common beliefs and values such as service, nonviolence, simplicity and an emphasis on community. In principle, Mennonites are not religious affiliated by birth, but voluntarily enter the community of faith by free choice. Because of this, any person can join the Mennonites regardless of having Anabaptist Mennonite ancestors.",1683,2021,1115,820,Sarah Bixler,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-10 23:21:50.850 +0200,2021-07-21 15:32:49.055 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),1.1566194132941026e-05,0.04823464501674903,3.915087721829286e-15,0.024314994566629777,0.0013906369500424481,1.4102099349190877e-12,5.062293243305799e-06,0.834907626491756,0.09113546848603242
970,Cult of Isis (Mysteries of Isis),43,Religious Group (v6),"Unlike many other mystery cults in the Ancient World, the Cult of Isis capitalize on its exotic, Egyptian appeal. In this henotheistic cult, Isis, an attractive female figure, mother of Horus, and devoted wife to Osiris in the narratives, becomes the supreme deity alongside Osiris and Divine Providence that offers one solution to the theological crisis of the 2nd century AD (Gasparini). Her association to Greek and Roman goddesses ranged from Artemis to Aphrodite, as de Witt points out: in the Classical period Herodotus makes Isis equivalent to Demeter as a fertility goddess, but by the Empire Plutarch states that Isis was Mut and Atyhri as well as Athena. Elsewhere, Artemis and Isis were associated together. An aretalogy, moreover from Kyme, Asia Minor has Isis controlling even Fate whom even the normal Graeco-Roman gods obey. Finally, in Corinth, Isis becomes a goddess of the sea and trade, and the festival Isidis Navigium is celebrated for the beginning of the sailing season, and the celebration even entered the Roman Fasti (calendar) during the Empire. 
Turning to the myth of Isis in the Graeco-Roman world, no other literary texts gives a complete narrative than Plutarchâs de Iside et Osiride. Even Egyptologists, such as Gwyn Griffiths and Hani, refer to Plutarchâs text and consider him a good scholar on religious history. Furthermore, the cult of Isis appears in many Greek and Latin inscriptions and it also features prominently in book eleven of the novel Metamorphoses of Apuleius, where Lucius in the form of the ass enters the cult of Isis, is initiated, experiences a religious encounter with Osiris, and recovers his true human body. In the soteriological myth of the cult, Plutarch outlines how Isis resurrects Osiris who was dismembered under the moon and killed by Typhon (Sett). Isis manages to put the pieces of Osiris back together save his phallus â scholars have offered many attempts to solve this part of the myth, including that Isis knew of Osirisâ adultery with Nephthys. From the myth, comes the idea from Egyptian theology that Osiris is the judge of the dead, who, if the deceasedâs heart is lighter than a feather, would allow the deceased into his blessed and eternal abode. Isis becomes the benefactor of mankind, and the clear implication of the general narrative is that devotees of the cult of Isis had hope in life after death and that Isis may raise them up like Osiris. Thus, it comes to pass that, as Witt notes, the cult of Isis develops a priesthood, festivals days, its own calendar, and a litany of sacred texts, such as the Andros Hymn and aretalogies that are found throughout the Mediterranean world. In the hymn, Isis gives the holy word (hieros logos) whose symbol is the linen garb to those who are initiated into her mysteries. 
The cult itself might have entered the Greek world during the Classical period, when the Athenian Assembly gave permission to some Egyptians to establish a temple to Isis in the Piraeus, as Simms has noted. From there on, in the Hellenistic Period, the Ptolemies â Greek rulers of Egypt â who used both Osiris and Isis to legitimize their pharaonic rule continue to spread cult activity primarily in Alexandria. Ptolemy I Soter was said to have invited a Timotheus to syncretize the Egyptian cult with Greek ideas, based on the Eleusian mysteries and Demeter worship (Witt). The Ptolemies and their wives, such as Arisinoe II, would continue to use the cult in order to establish their political authority by associating themselves with Osiris and Isis. From Alexandria, the cult spread to the rest of the Greek world and arrived to Delos. Scholars have traced that the cultâs arrival to South Italy originated from Delos when merchants were forced to flee due to conflict with the Seleuccids. In Italy, the cult can be found relatively early in the 3rd century BC in the Greek speaking portions â Sicily and Magna Graecia through numismatic and archaeological evidence, such as temples at Puteoli and Pompeii (RÃ¼pke). From there, in the 1st century BC, the cult of Isis enters Rome under Sulla, and the Pontifex Maximus Metellus funded the construction of an Isis shrine (Iseum Metellinum). The cult, however, did not enjoy immediate success. Among the non-aristocratic classes, the cult offered an alternative and a challenge of the authority of the Senate in competing with the gods of Jupiter and Venus (RÃ¼pke). The Roman Senate sought to ban the cult activities in the 50s and 40s BC and political violence involving factions of Pompey and Clodius involved members of the cult of Isis. During the Civil Wars, Antony and Cleopatra fashioned themselves as Osiris and Isis which led to Octavian, after his victory at Actium in 31 BC, to prohibit the cult from entering the pomerium of Rome. The hostility towards the cult reached its pinnacle in Tiberius when in AD 19, a Roman by the name of Mundus seduced a married Roman matron Paulina with the aid of the priests of the temple of Isis. Upon investigation, Tiberius banned the cult, destroyed the temple, crucified the priests, and banished Mundus into exile. From there, under Caligula and Nero, the cult of Isis enjoyed prestige and became one of the most popular mystery cults throughout the Mediterranean until the arrival of Mithraism and Christianity. With Theodosius edict to close all pagan temples in AD 394, the fate of the cult was pretty much sealed, although there is some evidence to suggest that in certain peripheral areas the cult lasted until the 6th century AD.",-323,500,132,733,Juan Dopico,18,Robyn Walsh,2020-08-11 23:06:52.508 +0200,2020-08-15 19:42:12.300 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.9950602069839988,6.782067800738832e-13,6.738185690068192e-15,0.0026967499716285055,4.504887153753877e-06,2.98158540216956e-14,5.946992668470699e-14,0.002238538156419837,2.4920108398230514e-14
971,GÄá¹apatya,43,Religious Group (v6),"The GÄá¹apatya SampradÄya denotes a cluster of religious denominations whose worship and devotional systems are centered upon Gaá¹eÅa (Ganapati), the elephant-headed son of deities Åiva and PÄrvatÄ«. Members of the sampradÄya are also referred to as GÄá¹apatyas. Most modern Hindus regard Gaá¹eÅa as a god who helps petitioners overcome various kinds of obstacles. Reflecting this belief, he is usually invoked at the beginning of most formal pujas as a precautionary measure to ward off anticipated hindrances, hypothetical or otherwise. GÄá¹apatyas expand this common Hindu position to interpret Gaá¹eÅa as the supreme manifestation of the supreme reality (brahman). 

Although archaeological and scriptural evidence point to Ganesha's emergence as a recognizable deity in the first years of the common era, it is currently impossible to indicate a precise founding date for the GÄá¹apatyas. Paul Courtright, the renowned American scholar of Ganesha, identifies the duration from the 6th to the 10th centuries CE as the likely time span of their early development. Some texts report that at least 6 different GÄá¹apatya maá¹­has (institutions) existed contemporaneously with those established by the theologian Åankara in the 9th century CE. Between the 6th to the 16th centuries CE, historians have noted the construction of dozens of temples across North, West and Southern India with Ganesha enshrined as the principal deity. Additionally, scholars of Hinduism have called attention to the composition of different Puranas and Tantras during the same period that describe the elaborate rituals and mythologies of textually-grounded communities that self-identify with the GÄá¹apatya label. 

While they appear to have died out as an independent sampradÄya by the 17th century CE for reasons that will be illuminated in other sections of this entry, vestigial traces of GÄá¹apatya-like practices continue to be observed in most forms of Indian religion. These practices are especially pronounced in Marathi-speaking areas. Courtright correlates the emergence of neo-GÄá¹apatya movements in Maharashtra to political ascent of the Peshwas in the late 17th century. Appointed to serve as Prime Ministers at the court of the region's Maratha ruler, the Peshwas were largely derived from ChitpÄvan Brahmin caste and worshipped   Ganesha as their clan deity (kuladevatÄ). They pioneered an elaborate display of the scripturally-prescribed, autumn Ganesh Chaturthi at their palace in Pune's Old City; these embellishments added amplified levels of grandeur to a festival that was hitherto observed as a domestic ritual at a simpler scale, subject to the discretion of individual families. These celebrations served to rekindle popular interest in temporarily-forgotten GÄá¹apatya temples and the latter have since enjoyed a dramatic rise in patronage from Hindus of all sampradÄyas. 

In the 1890s, the Pune palace's Ganesh Chaturthi ceremony was re-engineered by freedom fighter and religious reformer Bal Gangadhar Tilak into a festival celebrated almost entirely in the public domain. In the ensuing decade, the popularity of Tilak's remodeled ritual inspired the creation of countless ""Ganpati mandals"" (Ganesha committees) across Maharashtra, all dedicated to the organization of a 10-day long puja in honor of Ganesha that attracted participants from across the spectrum of Maharastrian castes. Scholars of Marathi religion like GS Ghurye and Anne Feldhaus have remarked that the universalization of Ganesh Chaturthi has enabled nationalists to itemize neo-Ganapatya beliefs as a distinctive marker of a Hindu-Marathi identity that continues to be mobilized in opposition to region's other religious influences. 

In more recent years, the Mumbai-based Bollywood film industry has frequently highlighted the worship of Ganesha, thereby motivating the reproduction of Ganesh Chaturthi festivals in other Indian states and in international cities that have large populations of Indian immigrants. All of these details notwithstanding, the residue of Ganapatya worship constitutes an essential aspect of modern Hinduism. A deeper investigation of this sampradaya reveals significant insights qua the nature of Indian religion at disparate historical moments.",500,2020,1135,795,Aditya Bhattacharjee,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-12 06:05:18.365 +0200,2020-08-21 08:43:10.091 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.0009112491958738669,6.489590631832419e-10,0.003159453208980851,0.010679999095629365,2.3004183421482282e-26,8.063372186697299e-37,0.9852492978503428,1.701212625073343e-20,2.1404955206817047e-13
972,Nestorian Christianity,43,Religious Group (v6),"Nestorian Christianity as a distinguished Christian group came into existence after the Christological movement that held the theological position initially developed by Nestorius (4/5 CE). Nestorius considered Christ the Son of God and Christ the son of Mary as two separate persons with two natures rather than one person having human and divine nature. That Christological teaching was officially condemned by the Council of Ephesus in 431. The Council of Ephesus anathema led to the separation of the early Church, development of the Nestorian doctrine and ultimately initiated the process of creating the so-called Church of the East. The teaching of the Church of the East as it developed throughout history should be distinguished from the initial Nestorian teaching. Theological differences quickly had political and socio-cultural implications at the global level (relationship with the Western Church as well as other Christian communities in the East).

Historically speaking, Nestorian Christians played an important role in bringing Christianity to China as well as other regions like Mongolia and India. The historical timeline of Nestorian Christianity depends on the region, socio-cultural setting and date of missionary penetration. 
The bilingual (Chinese-Syriac) Nestorian stele (8th ct) from Xian witnesses to the early 7th century presence of Christians in the area. Nestorian Christians also reached India, and interacted with many other groups as Mongols, Turks, and Uigurs.  Members of the Nestorian community played an importan role during the Islamic period when they translated many works by Aristotle into Arabic (e.g. Timothy I). Modern Assyrian Church of the East is the successor of medieval Nestorian Christians, but its doctrine today should not be identified with Nestorius. After the disintegration of the Mongolian Empire during the 14th century, the Church of the East faced rapid decline. In the aftermath of these events, the presence of Nestorian Christianity was mainly reduced to India and Mesopotamia. During the 16h century, some members of the community united with the Roman Catholic Church and were named Chaldeans, whereas those who did not united with the RCC became known as Assyrians. Nestorian Christians faced persecutions in Persia during the 6th century, but flourished in China (7-10th ct), and was also well received during the medieval Mongolian period.",431,1500,1121,770,Srecko Koralija,18,Robyn Walsh,2020-08-12 15:59:03.660 +0200,2020-08-15 20:44:08.278 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.05885927663636867,2.055100898983673e-12,4.012399546497257e-15,0.13863804273338923,0.005135664255816201,0.6897592651918412,0.00021999393640590462,0.10738770872317686,4.8520942920922374e-08
973,The Sarna religion of the Oraons of Jharkhand,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Indian state of Jharkhand is the homeland of 32 Scheduled Tribes (ST) and eight particularly vulnerable tribal groups.  According to the 2011 census, about four million Jharkhand residents are ST and the Oraon, who follow the Sarna religion, are about million. They are counted as ""other religions and persuasions"". The Sarna religion is based on animism and is sometimes called Addi Dharam.  They believe in a benevolent spirit and reply upon it for their overall wellbeing. The term 'Sarna' refers to a Sacred Grove or place of worship (which is usually a  Sal tree of the Shorea robusta species). The sacred grove is a small patch of forest that is protected because it is sacred and the site of deity worship. 'Spirits of the forest' are said to dwell in the roots of Sal trees, and 'spirits of the village' are said to reside in the most ancient of the Sal trees of the Sarna, or sacred grove of the village.  The tribal version of Sarna when we consider this linguistically offers a very pertinent explanation of the term Sarna. In Kurukh (Oraon language) there is a term called ''Saara Baana'' which means 'work to be accomplished'. In such a way, the place where all the wishes and works are accomplished is called Sarna. Controlling these events are different types of spirits: ancestral spirits, spirits of people who died unnaturally, or forest spirits. The sacred place is home to the deity Sarna Mai. Furthermore, peopleâs activities are based around propitiating, through blood sacrifice, spirits that happen to reside in nature. The Mundas and the Santals go to Sarna/Jaher for most of their religious rites, but Oraons go to Sarna only once a year. This yearly visit is for Khaddi, or the Sarhul feast, and the remaining have their own specific places of worship. The highest divinity or Supreme being, the creator of the Universe recognized by the Sarna Oraon is Dharmes. He fosters all living and non-living things. They believe that spirits control all the goods and the ills of life, like earthquakes, cyclones, and floods.  Second in the hierarchy are the spirits of naturally dead ancestors, called Pachbalar. Later sections belong to the village deities and spirits (Bansakti, Banjaribhut, Chatur-Siman-Garhadhora, Tusa-bhura). The fourth section are the spirits of hunting and war, called Chandi, worshipped by men; and spirits which protect pregnant women from the evil eye, called Joda and Achrael, worshipped only by women. The religion is organized around many tribal groups throughout Chattishgarh, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Assam, and West Bengal.",1845,2019,1136,616,Meenakshi Munda,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-12 17:16:33.308 +0200,2020-09-08 11:45:41.989 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.9999999999890112,1.0720754350217046e-11,4.834690107170213e-25,1.1577282326950134e-13,5.441509347499329e-24,1.5231990738249003e-13,1.2141017471222927e-23,1.2188004042395426e-23,1.1088864776408023e-42
974,"Greek Chalcedonian Christians, Nicaea",43,Religious Group (v6),"The empire of Nicaea existed from 1204 to 1261. Following the capture of Constantinople (modern Istanbul), many elites and the patriarch of the capital city moved to nearby Nicaea (modern Iznik), and this arrangement continued until 1261 when Constantinople fell to Michael VIII. Though predominantly (even almost exclusively) a Greek speaking, Chalcedonian Christian polity, it sat at the crossroads of polities comprised largely of Slavic Chalcedonian Christians, Roman Chalcedonian Christians, and Sunni Muslims. The mass movement of ecclesiastical hierarchy ensured, on the one hand, a general continuation of religious practice as it stood prior to the move, but led, on the other, to the development of new saintsâ cults and religious festivals. 
By the 1220s, the political capital had moved largely to Nymphaion, almost 400 km from Nicaea, where the patriarch and the religious authorities remained. There remained, nevertheless, close ties, even with somewhat increased independence. The Greek patriarch, in exile from the traditional see in Constantinople, found a home in various monasteries and churches in Nicaea, while still maintaining a strong claim to the Constantinopolitan throne. A kind of intellectual bifurcation arose: they were on the one hand banished from their home, while on the other, they had found a safe, and quasi-paradisiacal, refuge. 
The disruptive time from 1204 to 1261 does not seem to have produced any major discontinuities from a previous or later period, but perhaps new, and sometimes contradictory, emphases. Anti-Latin polemics, which had been present for centuries, heightened, but efforts towards union with the Roman church continued under the guidance of several emperors and patriarchs. There seemed to be a common vacillation between anti-papal and functionally pro-papal stances. The Roman state had long seen itself as a new Israel, and now the language of Israel in exile continued. Penalties against Jews, however, did not subside and indeed increased. Although occasional alliances with the Seljuks occurred and emperors sought the support of Seljuk leaders, a more favorable stance towards Islam does not seem to have arisen. 
New devotions appeared and certain old devotions increased. St Tryphon became a dynastic, and his feast became a major celebration during the time in Nicaea, which seems to cool after the return to Constantinople. Devotions to St John the Theologian and the Theotokos, long present in Roman society, increase and persist after the move from Nicaea. The devotion to the Theotokos may be seen even on seals and coins.",1204,1261,1124,817,Nikolas Churik,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-12 20:37:15.382 +0200,2021-05-18 06:01:02.590 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),3.418973269598438e-16,8.536436132745632e-15,0.03182392428838997,2.786930839361554e-13,0.011735241580642241,1.02903041138633e-34,4.146641439980639e-06,2.019360222833857e-22,0.9564366874892403
975,Neo-Charismatic Movement - Third Wave Charismatic Movement,43,Religious Group (v6),"Pentecostal and Charismatic practices of speaking in tongues through the Baptism of the Holy Spirit had become accepted within many mainline Protestant denominations and the Roman Catholic Church by the 1960s and 1970s. However, many evangelical traditions and churches continued to resist charismatic renewal practices and theologies during the rise of the Second Wave Charismatic Renewal Movement. Charismatics were viewed with suspicion and their practices were critiqued and mocked within evangelical circles.  

Yet, evangelicalism was not immune to change during the 1960s and 1970s. The hippie-led Jesus People Movement took hold in the United States during this time. Young barefoot preachers would encourage their peers to turn away from drugs, accept Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior, and join a new type of church that emphasized a come-as-you-are vibe with casual dress and provided rock and roll as part of their worship liturgy. In addition, many of the new hippie converts were interested in Charismatic practices of healing and witnessing through signs and wonders. The Jesus People Movement led to the formation of new independent evangelical churches that identified as non-denominational and some of these churches embraced Charismatic theology and practices.

One of the church movements that emerged in the late 1970s was the Vineyard Church in Southern California. The Vineyard was a collection of churches that broke away from Calvary Chapel due to the Vineyardâs desire to emphasize Charismatic practices and theology. On Motherâs Day in 1980, Pastor John Wimber of the Vineyard Christian Fellowship in Orange County, CA and invited a former Calvary Chapel pastor and the face of the Jesus People Movement, Lonnie Frisbee, to preach. Frisbeeâs message on healing and the subsequent ministry of healing that took place that morning launched the start of the Vineyard Movement and subsequent Neo-Charismatic movement. This new Neo-Charismatic movement blended evangelical theology with charismatic practices of healing, supernatural prayer languages, and an emphasis on miraculous signs and wonders as a component of evangelism. 

John Wimber began to teach at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, CA and was influenced by C. Peter Wagnerâs research on church growth as well as George Laddâs Kingdom of God theology. Wimber was able to influence numerous people to start their own independent charismatic churches and ministries as a faculty member and through his conferences that he hosted where he taught on how to minister using supernatural signs and wonder. Wimber developed the concept of âpower evangelismâ where adherents evangelized using signs and wonders rather than Bible tracts that were popular in the 1960s and 1970s.  

By the 1990s, new independent churches and movements that were evangelical and charismatic were rapidly emerging throughout North America. These included the Toronto Blessing Movement began in 1994 at the Toronto Airport Vineyard Church. Bethel Church in Redding, CA installed Pastor Bill Johnson as their senior pastor in 1996. The International House of Prayer Kansas City was founded in 1999. These Neo-Charismatic churches and others have become popular and controversial for their encouragement of the miraculous, their non-formal style of liturgy, and theological stances on healing, anointing, and supernatural power.

C. Peter Wagner coined the term âThird Waveâ charismatic movement to describe these new churches and ministries. Their emphasis on power evangelism, charismatic forms of worship, healing, prayer languages, operating in signs and wonders, and their emphasis on anointing leaders as apostles and prophets made them distinct from traditional Pentecostal churches and Charismatic Renewalists within mainline traditions.",1980,2020,1018,762,Nathan Womack,5,Courtney Fitzsimmons,2020-08-12 23:23:50.552 +0200,2020-08-20 07:03:33.628 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),7.829830825526338e-05,0.05625981671840208,1.5269832741509745e-15,0.15261722731893193,1.81663742168168e-05,7.564080753386075e-13,3.9065951003283914e-05,0.715340567523567,0.07564685780486556
976,Mising Community,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Mising community identifies as tribal and indigenous to Assam with migratory connections to the adjacent state of Arunachal Pradesh, in the northeastern region of India. They find definitive mentions in written sources, such as the Ahom Buranjis of the Ahom kingdom in Assam, from approximately 12th-15th centuries AD. They are listed as a Scheduled Tribe but are attempting to get 6th Schedule status. The 6th Schedule is a Government of India legislation that provides tribal autonomy in judicio-administrative proceedings of areas designated as Scheduled Areas. 

The community speaks Mising, a Tibeto-Burman language which is seen by several scholars to mark its migratory connection with the Sino-Tibetan and Tibeto-Burman region. They also speak Assamese. 

The Mising inhabit the Brahmaputra river valley along its northern bank covering several districts. This particular entry covers the Mising community living in small river islands known as the char region in Lakhimpur District, Assam. Surrounded by the Subansiri tributary of the River Brahmaputra, the chars are erosional spaces, some of which are submerged with the lashing of the floods each monsoon in the months of June and July. This char region is physically removed from areas across the river and require travel by ferries. 

The religion ascribed to by respondents from the river island area is understood as a mixture of Mising religious practices that focus on nature worship and Hinduism, specifically Vaishnavite Hindu practices. There is mention of the Vaishnava tradition being the first indicator of a conversion to Hinduism due to the popularity of the same in the region.  The Neo-Vaishnavite movement in Assam which is linked to spiritual leader Srimanta Sankardeva around15th century CE is often proclaimed as a socially 'integrative' and 'assimilative' force which saw tribal communities such as the Mising converting to Vaishnavism. 

The community continues to practice nature worship through several rituals honoring Donyi and Polo, referring to the sun and moon respectively.  Among other forces worshipped are asu(water), among(earth), asar(wind).
 
In 2019, there was seen to be a push amongst certain river island communities towards an increased emphasis on Donyi-Polo worship. That year, the BJP government won several tribal council elections and built alliances with Mising political parties.",1187,2019,1133,823,Nimisha Thakur,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-13 13:18:23.560 +0200,2020-08-20 10:27:15.312 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),6.642487342575968e-05,0.28932267465075784,8.644453134344127e-14,0.33177909754785945,0.0002961795158861637,1.1000359003334915e-13,0.002242469304021086,0.15808465710961336,0.21820849699824002
977,Chishti Sufis,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Chishtis are a Sufi order of immense influence in South Asia, founded in Chisht, Afghanistan, in the tenth century and brought to South Asia in the late twelfth century AD. It is considered the oldest of the Sufi orders operating in the region, and has enjoyed patronage from rulers and politicians throughout its history. Divided into sub-branches, the Chishti order is still influential today. 

The order quickly spread across South Asia even before Delhiâs political ascendancy, with early lodges (khanqahs) acting as sites of influence in Bengal, Gujarat, Malwa and the Deccan. Scholars have noted that such expansion indicates how the order was able to assimilate to social life in these areas; it is likely that for early adherents, Islam was synonymous with the teachings of the local Chishti shaykhs. This focus on adapting to local conditions has also been cited as a reason for their historically close relationship to local rulers and nobility. 

In the eighteenth century, the majority-Muslim qasbah towns of the Upper Doab emerged as sites of Chishti influence.

In Chishti sacred geography, the city of Delhi is especially significant. The shrine of Shaykh Nizamuddin Auliya (d. 1325) is an important site of pilgrimage: each year, the six-day urs ceremony held on the anniversary of Nizamuddin Auliyaâs death attracts 150,000 people from across the country. Rulers based in Delhi helped to consolidate the shrineâs importance. Another important pilgrimage site is in Ajmer, Rajasthan, the burial place of Moinuddin Chishti (d. 1236). Emperor Akbar relocated the Mughal capital to the village of Fatehpur Sikri to be next to the site of shaykh Salim Chishtiâs (d. 1572) khanqah. 

Though the shrines were always popular, membership in the Chishti order was associated with elites in Mughal times. From the late seventeenth century on, initiation into multiple Sufi orders became more common among prominent Muslim intellectuals, and many Muslim reformers of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries belonged to several orders. While pilgrimage and participation in festivals at shrines is widespread among South Asian Muslims (and some Hindus), formal membership in the order is now largely hereditary, as each Chishti shrine is maintained by a familial lineage of âsajjada nasheenâ or spiritual heads of the shrine, who wield power and influence as beneficiaries of donations made to the shrine and managers of its calendar of festivals.

Within the landscape of South Asian Sufi groups, the Chishtis are predominant. They are known for the importance of music in their religious gatherings: Chishtis are credited with the invention of qawwali music, a South Asian devotional genre which is sung on Thursday nights at many shrines and during the annual âursâ festivals which commemorate the saintâs union with God upon their death. The Chishti order has historically been associated with what has been called a âsyncreticâ culture in South Asia, merging elements from Hindu society in their devotional practices, for example in the rituals surrounding the tomb of the shaykh. 

The order defines itself based on a chain of authority (Silsila, meaning dynasty or literally âchainâ) that links its spiritual leaders (shaykhs) to each other all the way back to the Prophet. Consequently, there are several sub-sects established at breaking points in this list of shaykhs, called a âshajraâ, though these are not theologically distinct. In South Asia, the two main branches are the Chishti-Sabri (after âAlÄ-ud-dÄ«n âAlÄ« SÄbir, d. c. 1291) and the Chishti-Nizami (named for Nizamuddin Auliya, d. 1325).",1200,2020,1127,815,Hallie Swanson,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-13 17:11:40.867 +0200,2022-11-08 23:40:33.341 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),1.4113876618910131e-18,1.412076529851324e-14,0.006840336623790616,2.1650727233842235e-13,0.0009970486362954481,8.092852292391068e-37,1.0682625591155288e-07,4.626380953868657e-24,0.9921625079134275
978,Indonesian Catholicism,43,Religious Group (v6),"As a part of the universal Catholic Church, Indonesian Catholicism features all of the rites, scripture, hierarchy present in Roman Catholicism. As anywhere, however, this world religion is expressed, understood, and practiced in accordance with the unique cultural history of Indonesia. Initially arriving with Portuguese traders in the early sixteenth century, Indonesian Catholicism has grown and flourished, becoming a powerful religious and political contender in the country and beyond. Demonstrating significant diversity across the archipelago, Indonesian Catholicism often integrates itself with local traditions and accommodates itself to the needs of different peoples.

Catholics have played important roles in Indonesian history, contributing greatly to the national character and vision. In the nationâs early days, Catholic politicians and religious figures opposed the movement to require adherence to Islam, advocating instead for religious freedom. The effects of these debates can be seen in Indonesiaâs current policy of monotheism that recognizes six âofficialâ religions. One of Indonesiaâs principle newspapers, Kompas, was begun by Catholics in the1960s to offer an alternative to the media and perspectives of the Communist Party at the time. Today Kompas is a secular newspaper.  As in many parts of the world, Catholic schools and hospitals have often provided excellent education and healthcare, especially in remote regions that the state initially had trouble reaching, in this country of over 17,000 islands. 

Demographically, Catholics make up only a small minority of Indonesiaâs population: 2.91% according to the 2010 census, or about 7 million individuals. Of the 33 provinces existing during this census (room was made for a 34th in 2012), the provinces with the greatest number of Catholics were East Nusa Tenggara (54.14%), West Kalimantan (22.94%), and Papua (17.67%). East Nusa Tenggara is the only region where Catholics comprise a greater percentage of the population than any other religious group. Across Indonesia, 65% of Catholics live in the countryside, while the remaining 35% live in cities. Papua, West Papua, and East Nusa Tenggara are the poorest provinces in Indonesia (According to 2019-2020 data). 

The demographic distribution of religion in Indonesia, together with a lively culture of internal mobility and migration, means that certain ethnic groups have become associated in-country with Catholicism. Prominent among these are the Batak of Sumatra, some Dayak groups from Kalimantan, and some Chinese-Indonesians. Perhaps most well-known for their Catholic history and culture are the Florenese, whose yearly processions draw thousands of pilgrims from around the country. While members of these groups have gained recognition as propagating Catholicism in Indonesia, Catholics can be found across the country, of many different ethnicities and cultural backgrounds. Throughout itâs rich history, Indonesian Catholicism has contributed important ideas, values, and expressions both to the country of Indonesia and the global Catholic Church, strengthening the diversity of each.",1500,2020,1053,825,Meghan Rose Donnelly,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-13 17:55:54.231 +0200,2020-08-25 23:11:57.122 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.005622084359710281,0.3637865096935926,6.797809616184385e-16,0.018277915733465457,2.2825747422436004e-13,0.608618701336255,0.0036945876267749774,2.0124997280499532e-07,4.572600312048772e-19
980,Pure Land Buddhist Schools in Early Medieval Japan,43,Religious Group (v6),"The rise of the exclusive practice of the chanted nenbutsu (Jpn. senju nenbutsu) was integral to the development of Buddhism in medieval Japan. It involves exclusively practicing single-minded invocation of the Buddha AmitÄbha (Amida)âs name with six characters, âNa-mu A-mi-da butsuââliterally meaning âHomage to Amida Buddhaââ, by which to achieve salvation, birth in his Pure Land after oneâs death. The teaching of the exclusive nenbutsu represents a major intellectual trend in medieval Japanese Buddhism, where liberation from saá¹sÄric rebirth was often thought to depend on a single practice or condition. The doctrinal root of the teaching lies in the thought of a Japanese Buddhist thinker HÅnen-bÅ GenkÅ« (1133-1212). In the late twelfth century, HÅnen developed the radical claim that in the time when the Buddhist path is leading to its extinction, the entirety of this path should be encapsulated in a single practice of the chanted nenbutsu, through which he thought all sentient being will achieve birth in Amidaâs Pure Land after death. While the chanted nenbutsu had been traditionally construed as one of least essential practices suitable only to those of lesser religious capacity, HÅnen claimed its centrality in the Buddhist path, because he conceived it as a sole practice that Amida found corresponding to his original vow to save all sentient beings. According to him, Amidaâs selection of the chanted nenbutsu from multiple practices rendered all sentient beings equally benighted and thus urged them to rely completely on the other power of Amidaâs original vow that already guaranteed salvation. This claim led HÅnen to even insist that all other practices that require self-reliant efforts are to be totally abandoned. HÅnenâs teaching was further developed by one of his disciples Shinran (1173-1262), who gave a clearer expression to the absolute other power of Amida Buddha. These two thinkers, HÅnen and Shinran, were later regarded as the founders of two prominent Pure Land Buddhist schools, Pure Land school (JÅdo shÅ«) and True Pure Land school (JÅdo ShinshÅ«) respectively. They promoted the exclusive nenbutsu to address primarily the soteriological equality. However, as their followers proselytized the teaching from the late twelfth century, it did entail social implications for considering whether even those persons who violate religious and social norms could attain salvation. The teaching was thus of great appeal to those deemed as the hard-to-save in medieval society. Among them were included warriors, whose profession was taking lives, and women, who was regarded as with heavy karmic hindrances. The exclusive nenbutsu, however, also entailed an openness to the antinomian impulse, serving to legitimize zealous followersâ excessive acts, such as licensed evil and intentional violation the precepts. This invited severe criticism of HÅnen, Shinran, and their followers from the religious authority of the time and urged the authority to engage in suppressions of the followersâ groups.",1175,1333,1141,826,Kentaro Ide,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-16 21:21:12.313 +0200,2020-08-25 07:47:18.463 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),2.1776050379274818e-15,5.2331293135671066e-14,0.012757244314917041,0.9797265442073991,0.007495874594912943,5.420096685793518e-13,1.871245776743448e-05,1.6754786173000546e-23,1.624424406840108e-06
981,Nation of Islam,43,Religious Group (v6),"Established in the aftermath of the stock market crash of 1929, the Nation of Islam is a religious movement that facilitates its predominantly African-American followers to learn how to maintain a healthy lifestyle in urban settings.  The movement evolved out of a chance encounter between Clara Evans and Fard Muhammad on Hastings Street, the famous south-north street east of Downtown Detroit where a large number of African-American migrants from the rural south lived due to limited housing opportunities elsewhere in the city. Fard introduced Clara to a set of ritual practices related to hygiene, clothing, and diet rooted in the teachings of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, a prophetic figure from Qadian, Punjab. Clara drew upon his teachings to overcome dependency on public assistance amidst working as a domestic servant with an unemployed husband and a growing family. Faced by a declining Detroit Public School System, Clara established a homeschool for the neighborhood's children as well as adults, offering an Islamic education geared at overcoming periodic unemployment and the accompanying shame of failing to look after one's family. Over the next two decades, Clara and her fellow sisters helped expand the homeschool on a national scale, with similar schools appearing in other cities in the midwest with a large African-American population such as Chicago, Milwaukee, and Indianapolis as well as on the eastern seaboard such as Washington D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia, Harlem (New York) and Boston. Since the passing of Clara's husband Elijah Muhammad in 1975, the Nation of Islam has split into two factions: one that abides by the doctrinal innovations introduced by Elijah such as his status as a Prophet and Fard as God incarnate and another that follows Elijah's son Warith (Wallace) Deen Muhammad exhortation to embrace Sunni Islam and its understanding of prophecy and divinity rooted in the Quran and the hadith. These doctrinal contestations however are overshadowed by a consensus among members of both factions that black motherhood is both scientifically advanced and morally upright.",1930,2020,1153,748,SherAfgan Tareen,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-17 16:37:11.736 +0200,2021-11-30 18:19:31.489 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.005196517729657229,0.9632545008113809,2.1841025610967475e-15,0.026859433611581694,2.7133035276915636e-14,8.468295043273649e-12,0.00468442221348244,5.125624379120021e-06,1.0211964517610795e-12
982,The Samaritans (Persian to early Roman periods),43,Religious Group (v6),"The Samaritans are a religious group in the Abrahamic Tradition that originated in northern Israel. The group, which exists to the present day, traces its origins to ancient Israel and holds that their southern neighbors split off from them during the time of Eli. Ancient Samaritans worshiped the God of Israel and claimed that they, not the Jews, preserved the correct practices for worship. The separation between the two groups was gradual but would likely have been established by the time of (or as a result of) Hyrcanusâ destruction of the temple at Mt. Gerizim in the 2nd century BCE. 
The primary religious text of the Samaritans is called the Samaritan Pentateuch, or the Samaritan Torah, which contains the first five books of the Hebrew Bible. Traditionally, Samaritans regard the Pentateuch as the only authoritative biblical books. Although most of the differences between the Samaritan Pentateuch and the Jewish Torah are largely technical, the Samaritan Pentateuch includes several substantive differences, most of which are related to their claim that Mt. Gerizim, not Jerusalem, is the appropriate place for worshiping the God of Israel. 
The major sources on early Samaritans include Josephus, the New Testament, and Rabbinic Literature, although references to the Samaritans have also been suggested in works such as Ezra, Nehemiah, and Ben Sira. In addition to literary sources, much recent work in archaeology has provided further information about the ancient Samaritans.",-499,100,1138,824,Sara Boston,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-17 17:22:17.818 +0200,2020-08-28 12:52:45.250 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.0003036857640932551,0.026341806773536147,1.778897188823537e-15,0.033433137816339595,0.00013187420492354575,2.2090623598624163e-12,6.549260936274293e-05,0.9113341694201208,0.02838983340941306
984,Calvinism (Early/Reformation),43,Religious Group (v6),"Calvinism, in its early stages, drew its character and theological emphases from the ministry and teaching of John Calvin. Born in France, Calvin moved to Geneva in 1534 and, after a brief exile (1538-41), he returned and was installed as the religious leader of the new republic. Calvin was influenced by other early ReformersâMartin Luther, Huylrich Zwingli, Philip Melancthon, and Heinrich Bullingerâand adopted the theological touchstones of the movement: scripture alone, faith alone, grace alone, Christ alone, and glory to God alone. While early Calvinism continued to affirm much of the Christian tradition, Calvin was instrumental in forming his own distinct form of Protestantism. Theologically, early Calvinism distinguished itself from Roman Catholicism in its understanding of the authority of scripture, the person and work of Jesus Christ (Christology), the emphasis on Godâs election (predestination), the sacraments, and on the purpose and shape of the Christian life. In terms of the latter, Calvin uniquely combined the ecclesiastical structures of the church in Geneva with the local governing structures, effectively combining his theological commitments about the transformation of the human being by the grace of God in faith with their social and ethical expressions. His understanding of the way the Church could and should regulate the moral lives of citizens, as well as church members, was rooted in an expectation that this was how societies, nations, and eventually the world, would be transformed. While later Calvinism is associated with a number of different ecclesiastical forms and cannot be said to agree on any one set of theological doctrines, early Calvinism was very much tied to the person of John Calvin and the local way he applied his theology, ecclesiastically and politically, in Geneva. Where applicable, it will include the work of his contemporaries in the Reformation moments (i.e., Zwingli in Switzerland, Luther in Germany)",1520,1565,1139,828,Chelsea Williams,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-21 19:38:04.041 +0200,2020-09-08 17:28:45.287 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),1.1566194132941026e-05,0.04823464501674903,3.915087721829286e-15,0.024314994566629777,0.0013906369500424481,1.4102099349190877e-12,5.062293243305799e-06,0.834907626491756,0.09113546848603242
985,The Victorines,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Victorines refer to the individuals, thought and practices associated with the Catholic abbey of St Victor. Established by William of Champeaux (1070 â 1121) in 1108, just outside Paris on the left bank of the Seine, the abbey of St. Victor was founded as a refuge for contemplation and teaching, surviving until its dissolution during the French Revolution. This focus on teaching made St Victor part-abbey, part-school, accepting adult male novices aged 15 or over. St Victor rose to prominence in the first and second quarters of the twelfth century under a series of talented abbots and teachers, becoming a renowned centre for theological and philosophical innovation. The exhortation to âlearn everythingâ (omnia disce) issued by the orderâs most famous master, Hugh of St Victor (c. 1096 â 1141), served aptly as the statement of the institutionâs methodology and purpose. Poetry, metaphysics, history, biblical exegesis, humanism, trinitarian theology, contemplation and mysticism were all practiced within the abbeyâs walls. What united members of the school of St Victor was the belief that the categorisation, systematisation and harmonisation of theology and philosophy possessed the salvific purpose of restoring man to the âimage and likenessâ of God. 

Denominationally, the abbey of St Victor belonged to the religious â as opposed to secular â branch of canons (regular canons) who lived communally, were attached to a church, and followed a particularly strict interpretation of the Rule of St Augustine for instruction. Like other twelfth-century Augustinian groups of regular canons, for example, the Premonstratensians, the identity of the Victorines and their ethos of reform was shaped by the Gregorian Reform movement from the mid-eleventh century that had reorganised the clergy and re-emphasised their commitment to poverty and teaching. What differentiated the Victorines from other groups of canons regular were its royal connections, the stress of a life of philosophical virtue and its specific blend of love and friendship â a trait shared with monastic orders of the day. However, in contrast to Benedictine, Cistercian and Augustinian monks, the Victorines occupied a liminal position as a âquasi monasticâ organisation. While monastic traits such as hierarchical system of titles, a central legislative body and a rule of silence were observed, the Victorines avoided a system of unequal mother-daughter house filiations like the Cistercians, equally emphasised theological and philosophical knowledge, and their geographical position close to the city ensured that they retained a distinctive balance between the active and contemplative modes of life.",1108,1299,1143,830,Jack Ford,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-24 22:51:30.721 +0200,2020-09-25 10:12:40.802 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.0003036857640932551,0.026341806773536147,1.778897188823537e-15,0.033433137816339595,0.00013187420492354575,2.2090623598624163e-12,6.549260936274293e-05,0.9113341694201208,0.02838983340941306
986,Theurgy,43,Religious Group (v6),"Theurgy in late antiquity combined Platonic philosophy with the indigenous ritual practices of the Roman Empire (sacrifice, divination, etc.). Although theurgy first appeared in the so-called Chaldean Oracles of the second century CE, the most important surviving statement of theurgic theory and practice is the treatise ""On the Mysteries"" (De mysteriis) of the Neoplatonic philosopher Iamblichus (c. 240 â c. 325 CE). Scholars generally understand Neoplatonism beginning with Iamblichus to represent a break with the earlier thought of Plotinus (205 â 270 CE) due to its reliance on ritual as a means of salvation for the soul. After Iamblichus, the most important expositor of theurgic Neoplatonism was Proclus (412 â 485 CE), whose ideas directly influenced the Christian liturgy of pseudo-Dionysius. The word theurgy combines two Greek roots, theos (god) and ourgos (work). As ""divine work,"" theurgy is understood to be a cooperative endeavor between the gods and human beings, in which the latter use divinely inspired ritual to increase their fitness for divine influence. Informed by centuries of Platonic thinking about individual and cosmic bodies, theurgy maps the parts of the self (microcosm) onto the parts of the universe (macrocosm), allowing one to enact rituals in order to purify or empower the parts of the self through an understanding of cosmic sympathy. Theurgic ritual, according to Iamblichus and Proclus, interacts with the various parts of the highly stratified divine cosmos, which is itself envisioned (following Platoâs Timaeus 30d-31a) as a single living being encompassing all other beings. The metaphor of a living cosmos provides the basis for the doctrine of cosmic sympathy (sumpatheia) and its transcendent cause, divine love (theia philia), which provides cohesion for the universe (macrocosm) as well as for the individual soul (microcosm). The sympathy between the soul, the universe, and the gods allows the theurgist to employ ""signatures"" (sumbola, sunthÄmata) consisting of natural materials (e.g. stones, plants, incense), divine names, and mental constructs in order to achieve his or her goals. The goals of theurgy are consistent with those of Platonic philosophy â becoming like god (á½Î¼Î¿Î¯ÏÏÎ¹Ï Î¸Îµá¿·: Platoâs Theaetetus 176b) â as a lifelong practice producing a ""cumulative contact, assimilation, and, ultimately, union with the divine and thereby the divinization of the theurgist"" (Addey 2014: 25). A cosmic hierarchy of beings, thought forms, and ritual objects informed this lifelong practice and may have made theurgy difficult to distinguish from magic for the casual observer. In fact, the principles of theurgic ritual were very close to Plotinusâs account of how magic (mageia, goÄteia) functioned through cosmic sympathy (Ennead 4.4.40). However, theurgy was distinct from ancient magic in at least two ways: (1) The aims of theurgy were different. Whereas magicians might think to coerce the gods for their own worldly ends, theurgists (and all Platonists) understood the gods to be immutable, so they instead focused on enhancing their own fitness for assimilating divine power, which was a gift from the gods. (2) Although cosmic sympathy in its popular form may have functioned ""horizontally"" in the material world only, for theurgists sympathy as an expression of divine love (theia philia) always had a vertical component: objects in the material world derived their potency from divine powers by corresponding to a certain ""chain"" (seira) of influence, such as a planet or another astrological category.",150,529,1144,778,Brian Alt,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-24 23:09:19.924 +0200,2020-09-11 05:00:17.397 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),6.708433441458223e-39,3.561802792802758e-38,0.9999999999999979,2.205880281111888e-15,3.728610726083061e-26,4.231145986858171e-60,1.2549334090926768e-29,7.190922985263511e-50,2.5965198827684726e-27
987,"Parsis, Zoroastrians of India",43,Religious Group (v6),"The Parsis (or Parsees) are an ethno-religious community traditionally based in western India, and professing the Zoroastrian religion. They are the descendants of the group of Zoroastrians who migrated to India after the Islamic conquest of Iran in the 7th century CE. The Parsis of India constitute the largest community of followers of Zoroastrianism in the world. Over the centuries, the Parsis have integrated into Indian society, while simultaneously maintaining their distinct religious customs and ethnic identity. The term PÄrsi (meaning âPersianâ in the Persian language) is used as a descriptor of the community signifying their Iranian origin.
The early history of the Parsis in India is not known well, and mainly traced to a single source, the Qisse-ye SanjÄn âThe Story of SanjÄnâ dated to 1600 CE. After initially settling in and around the town of SanjÄn in South Gujarat on the west coast of India, they are supposed to have dispersed northwards to other towns in Gujarat, mainly Navsari, Ankleshwar, Bharuch and Khambat (Cambay).
However the period from the 17th century onward is relatively well recorded, and after the arrival of the British in India, the Parsis transformed from a predominantly rural agricultural community to one engaged in many services and industrial pursuits, especially in the cities of Surat and Bombay. The 18th and 19th centuries saw the community rapidly rising to prominence, and under British patronage, were pioneers in many fields including education and the arts. Many prominent families amassed large fortunes and the community became well-known for its munificent charities. In the 20th century, the Parsis dispersed across the Indian sub-continent as well as to other British colonies such as Aden and East African countries.
The Parsis today are a highly urbanised community with more than 95% of its members living in cities, chiefly Mumbai (formerly Bombay) which has been home to 70% of the Indian Parsis since the 1950s. The last fifty years have seen many Parsis, especially the youth, emigrating to other countries, mainly UK, USA and Canada, the Middle-east and more recently to Australia and New Zealand.  

Class: Among the Parsis, the priestly class (Athornans) is differentiated from the laity (Behdins), and the priesthood is hereditary. Only boys belonging to the priestly class are eligible to undergo the initiation ceremonies of priesthood. 
Language: Since the Parsis were based in the Indian state of Gujarat for much of their long history, their native language is Gujarati; however their dialect, Parsi Gujarati, is distinct from the standard Gujarati of the state. While almost all Parsis can converse in Gujarati, the youth especially in urban areas increasingly use English as their primary language for communication. The religious texts of the Parsis are mainly in Avestan, an Old Iranian language, and also in Pahlavi (Middle Persian). Though both these languages are not comprehended by a majority of the Parsis, all prayers are still recited in these languages as per tradition by both the priesthood and the laity.
Sects: The Parsis are differentiated from their fellow Zoroastrians who arrived from Iran to India in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and are known as the Iranis. The term Parsi-Irani is used as a designator for the entire Zoroastrian community of India, however the standalone term Parsis is also used interchangeably as an all-encompassing term. 
The community is also divided on the basis of a calendrical difference into two factions, the majority Shahenshahis (âRoyalistsâ) who continued to follow the existing calendar of the Indian Zoroastrians, and the minority Kadimis (âAncientsâ) who adopted the old calendar of the Iranian Zoroastrians, which runs one month ahead of the Shahenshahi calendar.",1600,2020,1145,831,Kerman Daruwalla,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-25 21:19:36.333 +0200,2020-09-13 00:58:20.758 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),4.792499236304359e-16,3.25624030966137e-15,0.9999999999983904,4.586344033385515e-14,1.5600576331479194e-12,4.101252600191184e-36,9.71853959693707e-27,6.8956742457220875e-28,2.7708170876853945e-21
988,Churches of Christ- United States,43,Religious Group (v6),"Churches of Christ in North America are a collection of autonomous Christian congregations that have their origins in the ""Restoration Movement"" within American Christianity that occurred in the 1800's. Located primarily in the American south, Churches of Christ emerged in the first major division of the Stone-Campbell Movement at the end of the nineteenth century. This separation was made complete in 1906, when the United States Bureau of the Census distinguished Churches of Christ as a separate and distinct religious group. There are currently more than 13,000 individual congregations within the United States with an average membership of 100 people. Of those 13,000 congregations, 1,240 of them have a predominately African American membership (approximately 172,000 members). Churches of Christ also has an additional 240 congregations that are independent Spanish-speaking churches, most of which are located in Texas, California, and Puerto Rico.

The majority of members of Churches of Christ in the United States live in the central and southern regions of the country. While there are Church of Christ congregations in every state, they are most heavily concentrated in the American south, from Texas to North Carolina. More than 28 percent of members of Churches of Christ live in either Texas or Tennessee. Churches of Christ began from a motivation not to start a new form of Christianity, but to serve as a unifying movement that sought to bring together previously divided Christians through an appeal to the pattern of Christianity as interpreted in the New Testament. 

Following from this appeal to a return to the form of Christianity present within the New Testament, Churches of Christ have rejected any formal organizational structures, choosing instead to have the local congregation serve as its own governing authority. This has also meant that Churches of Christ have no official journals or other processes by which to declare sanctioned positions. Because of the independent nature of Churches of Christ, commonalities across the tradition depend more on a specific set of practices and interpretive strategies than declared theological convictions or beliefs.

While changing within some parts of the tradition, Churches of Christ is most well-known for its practice of acapella singing. Yet there are other distinctive features that have marked this denomination as a distinctive group among other Christian traditions. First among these distinctive features is the hermeneutical approach that has been at the core of Church of Christ identity and practice since its inception. This interpretive approach rests on a three-fold pattern that reads Scripture and shapes its communal and individual practice by finding in Scripture a direct command, an example to imitate, or by making a necessary inference when commands or examples are not present. This interpretive approach has been highly influential within Churches of Christ, and is the source of many contemporary debates and the appropriate response. Second, Churches of Christ are defined by a strong commitment to notions of the priesthood of all believers, and therefore eschew any distinction between a âreligiousâ and ânon-religiousâ class. There is no ordination process within Churches of Christ. And while religious training (either through a theological school or some other form) is viewed as a positive thing, none is required to serve in a ministerial role within the tradition. Rather, worship and communal life within Churches of Christ is dependent upon a high level of involvement by the members of each congregation. Finally, Churches of Christ have, historically, possessed a high level of exclusivism in its understanding of its religious identity. While this characteristic has come under fire and is changing within many parts of the tradition, it has been a defining feature for much of the traditionâs history.

As it moves into the 21st century, Churches of Christ are currently facing a number of questions and challenges, ranging from questions of gender and sexuality inclusion, to the trends of religious decline that are effecting all religious traditions within the United States.",1832,2020,1146,821,Mason Lee,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-08-28 16:18:01.121 +0200,2020-09-21 13:44:34.410 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),1.1566194132941026e-05,0.04823464501674903,3.915087721829286e-15,0.024314994566629777,0.0013906369500424481,1.4102099349190877e-12,5.062293243305799e-06,0.834907626491756,0.09113546848603242
989,Opus Dei,43,Religious Group (v6),"Opus Dei (âWork of Godâ in Latin), also known as the Prelature of the Holy Cross, is a modern international institution within the Roman Catholic Church. Opus Dei was founded by Josemaria Escriva (1902-1975), a Spanish priest who was canonized as a saint by the Catholic Church in 2002.  According to Escriva, after years of waiting to learn how God wanted Escriva to uniquely serve him, Escriva received a divine inspiration on October 2, 1928 to found a new path within the Catholic Church by which all men and women could hear and follow the universal call to holiness. The universal call to holiness refers to the belief that God desires all human beings to be saints. Escriva founded Opus Dei specifically to help Catholic lay people (i.e. non priests, monks, and nuns) become saints through their professional work. He writes that âthe sole objective of Opus Dei has always been to see to it that there be men and women of all races and social conditions who endeavor to love and to serve God and the rest of mankind in and through their ordinary work, in the midst of the realities and interests of the worldâ (Josemaria Escriva, Conversations, no. 10).  There are currently about 90,000 members of Opus Dei of every racial, social, and secular condition in more than 90 countries. Opus Dei is not a religious order of the Catholic church. Members of Opus Dei do not take religious vows or distinguish themselves from their fellow citizens, and they live and work in the world just as they did before they joined Opus Dei.  Members are united by the ideal of following Christ and totally giving themselves to God as ordinary citizens and family members, and thus being Christian contemplatives in the middle of the world. Escriva chose St. Joseph, husband of the Virgin Mary, as the patron or special protector of Opus Dei, since St. Joseph lived an integrated life of prayer, ordinary work, and familial and social relationships. According to Escriva, the foundation of Opus Deiâs spirituality is an awareness of every human beingâs divine filiation, or status as a child of God.  Members of Opus Dei are supposed to practice and share confidence in divine providence, simplicity in dialogue with God, fraternity among all people, respect for human dignity, a love for the world and all realities created by God, and a spirit of peace and cheerful hope. Other key features of Opus Deiâs spirituality are the importance of prayer and sacrifice, the value of personal freedom, charity towards others, and unity of life (i.e. the integration of oneâs interior and religious life with oneâs professional, social, and family life). Opus Dei has existed as an institution since 1928, but it was erected as a personal prelature of the Church in 1982 by a pontifical act. According to the formal document composed by the Sacred Congregation for Bishops and approved by Pope John Paul II, the Prelature of the Holy Cross âis directly aimed at promoting the apostolic activity of the Church, inasmuch as it puts into operation a new pastoral instrument, which up to now was only foreseen and desired in the law of the Church, and it does so through an institution which offers proven guarantees of apostolic vigor, discipline and faithfulness to the teaching of the Churchâ (âVatican Declaration concerning Opus Dei,â 1982). Opus Dei is governed by the prelate of Opus Dei and his councils, who reside in Rome. The clergy of Opus Dei are drawn from the lay members of Opus Dei.

993,Pontifex Maximus and Pontifices (Pontifical College),43,Religious Group (v6),"Perhaps, no other religious title and college has as long a tenure as the Pontifex Maximus and the Pontifical College, whose origins lay in the mythical foundations of Rome and continue today, albeit organizationally, religiously, and semantically different, in the Vatican within the Roman Catholic Church. The Pontifex Maximus and the Pontifical College has a debated origin. On the one hand, some scholars such Denova continue the traditional line that âPontifexâ means âthe bridge builderâ between man and the gods, and that the Pontifices were associated with the early river worship of the Tiberinus, and later Jupiter Optimus Maximus. Others such as Ribezzo and Kavanagh have argued that Pontifex comes from Sabine (Italic Oscan) and the word means âcollege of fiveâ (ponti < puntes âfiveâ and fex < trefex âcollegeâ). 
Nevertheless, what is generally agreed upon is that the Pontifices served as advisors to the king of monarchical Rome. In Roman legends and ancient Roman historiography, King Numa (according to Livy) was one of the first Pontifex Maximus who established the organizational bureaucracy of the Roman state religion, the Vestal Virgins, and the appointment of other Pontifices. Whatever the reality of the situation was during the regal period of Rome, by the Middle of the Roman Republic, the Pontifices and their college began to have power over other priesthoods of Rome: the rex sacrorum, Vestal Virgins, the other flamines of other gods, the augurs, and, finally, the haruspices. Furthermore, the Pontifical College was in charge of the following activities: record keeping (annals, commentaries, etc.), the correct form of ritual and prayers, the Roman Calendar (âfastiâ), family law â patrician marriage, adoption, and the transference of dead bodies to other burial sites. Because the Pontifices were at the top of the Roman civic cult, additionally, they approved whether or not a new god could enter the Roman Pantheon (cases abound, such as Magna Mater and Quintus Metellus building a shrine to Isis -see the entry on Cult of Isis). 
To highlight their importance, the offices of the Pontifical College were located in Regia and the living quarters of the Pontifex Maximus was in the domus publica, both of which are situated in the Roman forum â the civic center of Rome. Additionally, the Pontifical College was originally only reserved to the patrician class during the Early and Middle Republic, but by 300 BC, under the lex Ogulnia, the Pontifical College was open to the plebeians and the number of pontiffs increased to nine (RÃ¼pke). Furthermore, the Pontifex Maximus was subject to direct election of a selected number of Roman tribes (seventeen out of the thirty-five selected by lot - RÃ¼pke), and remained an appointment for life. The first plebeian Pontifex Maximus was, perhaps, Tiberius Coruncanius elected in 254 BC by the comitia and first published public consultations (Cornu-ThÃ©nard).
One last bureaucratic feature of the Pontifical Colleges was that Pontiffs could also become secular, legal magistrates and hold political office. Cases abound, and famous examples are the jurist Scaevola and Julius Caesar. Nevertheless, the Pontiffs were prohibited from holding other priesthoods, except for rare occasions (see Szelmer). Because a person could be both a pontiff and magistrate, it is quite clear that under the Roman Republic that the Pontifical College and the Senate worked closely in tandem. The Senate consulted the Pontifical College on omens, prodigies, and on what days could public and state business be held. At times, the position of pontiff could be used as political leverage, such as Julius Caesar who was elected as Pontifex before holding a single political office (Ross Taylor).
Over time, however, the power of the Pontifical College and the Pontifex Maximus was diminished and became increasing subject to the violent political forces of the Late Republic. The dictator Sulla removed the Lex Domitia â the direct election of pontiffs by the comitia of the Roman people â and placed the election at the hands of the Pontifical College. This was undone later by the Lex Labiena, though Lily Ross finds that there was no change under Sulla and that Caesar solely supported the Lex Labiena to gain popular favor. Another restriction to the Pontificate was the Lex Papia that prohibited the Pontifical College from directly selecting a Vestal Virgin: instead, the Pontifex Maximus recommended names to be selected by lot at a public Roman contio (Mekacher and Van Haeperen).
At last, with the dictatorship of Julius Caesar, the ensuing civil wars, and Augustusâ election in 12 BC as Pontifex Maximus (Cameron), did the unification of the Pontifex Maximus and secular power occur. As Emperor, Augustus expanded the power of the Pontifex Maximus over all religious colleges that were not subject to the purview of the Pontifical College (such as mystery cults) (Cameron), and enshrined the power of both Emperor and Pontifex Maximus in the Imperial cult. The Emperor as Pontifex Maximus continued long into 4th and 5th century, despite the advent of Christianity and the Christian appropriation of pontifices to name their bishops. Cameron points out that the bishop of Rome in the AD 360s was pontifex summus, and not maximus. Furthermore, Christian emperors did not shy away from the title of Pontifex Maximus, until, perhaps, the Emperor Gratian in AD 382, where inscriptions begin to state imperial nomenclature not as Pontifex Maximus, but as Pontifex Inclitus (Cameron). Whatever the case may be, the situation of Late Antiquity demonstrates the process in which Church hierarchy begins to shed off the influence of imperial power that will culminate in the investiture conflicts of the Middle Ages (Concordat of Worms) and the Renaissance.",-712,380,872,733,Juan Dopico,18,Robyn Walsh,2020-09-06 03:09:34.526 +0200,2020-09-16 00:46:38.720 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.9759985613501495,0.022569266131063134,1.5760690112164785e-15,7.18381644640133e-11,9.37452066491635e-16,0.0014321724401662492,6.780332736104794e-12,3.76477816924833e-21,5.762898731896561e-42
994,"Monastic Communities of Lower Egypt: Nitria, Kellia, Scetis",43,Religious Group (v6),"Ascetic practices had been rich and varied from the beginning of Christian history.  In the first few centuries CE, precedents were established for some of the ascetic practices and goals monasticism became known for, such as the existence of communities of ascetic practioners living according to common spiritual goals, and the movement from populated centers to the outskirts, for reasons that included (but were not limited to) seeking peaceful environments for spiritual contemplation.  Christianity became officially recognized as a legal religion under Constantine in the early fourth century, and this policy change allowed the freedom for new modes of Christian practice and social organization.

In late third- and early fourth-century Egypt, new forms of Christian ascetic practice arose in the forms of eremitic, semi-eremetic, and cenobitic monasticism.  Eremitic monasticism, engagement in a solitary lifestyle devoted to spiritual pursuits apart from society, gained notoriety with the wide circulation of the Life of Antony by Athanasius, the archbishop of Alexandria.  Over time, influenced by reports of Antony, who lived alone for years in increasingly remote and challenging locations, battling demons and attaining a rare level of spiritual transformation, thousands of people, following his example, moved into the desert.  The three areas described in this entry were major centers for this new semi-eremitic monastic way of life.  (Compare these forms of monasticism with cenobitic monasticism, a more fully communal lifestyle, as represented by Pachomian monasticism, which is described in detail in a separate DRH entry.)

Amoun is credited for founding Nitria, about forty miles southeast of Alexandria (near modern al-Barnuji).  This site grew quickly to include not only monks seeking a spiritual life removed from society, but additionally, supportive visitors and other travelers who would stay in the area, with the result that over time, a tourist industry of sorts sprang up in the area.  This influx of visitors encroached on the monastic goal of a lifestyle of peaceful meditation, and some monks decided to move farther into the desert, into the area of Kellia (which means âthe cellsâ).  A story is told about Amoun and Antony determining the location of the new site within a dayâs walk of Nitria (about twelve miles away), far enough to achieve the remoteness desired, but close enough to facilitate visiting between the two communities (APalph Antony 34).  South of Nitria and Kellia is the area of Scetis, founded around 330 by Macarius of Egypt (so-called to distinguish him from Macarius of Alexandria) around a series of saline lakes (modern Wadi el Natrun).  All three locations are associated with niter/natron, a salt compound used in embalming, cleaning, and Egyptian faience.  These communities thrived and achieved wide renown as tales of their practices and inhabitants spread and inspired others across the Roman Empire during the fourth and fifth centuries.  Beginning in the early fifth century, a series of raids by desert nomads caused destruction to these communities, and initiated a slow decline.  Nitria was abandoned by the seventh century, and Kellia by the ninth.  Monastic activity waxed and waned over time in Scetis, with monastic activity still there in the present day.  The date range I cite for this entry (330-470 CE) is based on the estimated chronological limits for the primary evidence I am drawing from in answering the questions below.

The Apophthegmata Patrum (Sayings of the Fathers) preserves collections of sayings across multiple versions (notably the Alphabetical Collection [APalph], arranged by the name of the speaker named, the Systematic Collection [APsys], arranged roughly by topic, and the Anonymous Collection [APanon]), and in several languages.  (Note that because of this complicated source set, my AP citations below correspond to the numbering of commonly available English translations instead of critical editions, with the intention that a wider and more general readership can more easily track these down if interested.)  The sayings tend to follow the pattern of wisdom literature: short and pithy sayings intended to teach a moral lesson. Many come as responses to requests such as, âAbba, give me a word,â and âAbba, how can I be saved?â  Some are short dialogical narratives, often between a younger monk and a more experienced monk.  The majority (but not all) of these sayings are associated with residents of Nitria, Kellia, and Scetis, the last with the highest proportional representation.  These sayings were passed down and circulated through oral tradition and finally recorded probably in the late fifth century in Palestine.

In this entry, I am going to use the shorthand description âNitrian Desert communitiesâ to refer to Nitria, Kellia (with Pherme), and Scetis instead of listing them individually when I mean to refer to all of them.  This is not to say that there were not significant differences among people, practices, and social norms in these distinct areas; in fact, there were.  But rather, these can be grouped together meaningfully under one heading for two main reasons: 1) There is a recognizable monastic culture that is shared among these areas, partially because of the close social ties and visiting practices among them that fostered a coherent cultural and even social unity despite their geographical spread, and 2) the Apophthegmata Patrum, the largest single source (or more accurately, set of sources) of information about these communities, draws from their combined cultural group as a meaningful unit.",330,470,1150,818,Tola Rodrick,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-09-08 16:58:32.904 +0200,2020-09-24 00:07:04.925 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.0003036857640932551,0.026341806773536147,1.778897188823537e-15,0.033433137816339595,0.00013187420492354575,2.2090623598624163e-12,6.549260936274293e-05,0.9113341694201208,0.02838983340941306
995,Tamil Neo-Saivism,43,Religious Group (v6),"Generally understood to emerge with the teachings of the Tamil Sri Lankan religious scholar Arumuga Navalar (1822-1879), Tamil neo-Saivism is a discrete, reformist strain of Saiva Siddhanta Hinduism that has had wide-reaching influence on Tamil Hindu religious life and modern Tamil cultural thought in the Tamil cultural regions of South India and northern Sri Lanka (i.e., Tamil Elam). Some key features of Tamil neo-Saiva thought and practice include a frequent theological and scholastic focus on autonomous, ""Dravidian"" Tamil cultural identity and history relative to Brahmanical, Sanskritic, ""Aryan"" Hinduism; an explicitly monotheistic theology centered on the Hindu god Siva (Tamil civaá¹, Sanskrit Åiva; spelled Siva in this entry in deference to English-language neo-Saiva spelling conventions); and a particular connection with the Vellala caste community, a non-Brahmin Tamil caste community especially culturally influential and prestigious in pre-colonial Tamil society. Key to the intellectual development of neo-Saivism was the efflorescence of Tamil literary and historical scholarship associated with the Tamil Renaissance of the closing decades of the 19th century. Vellala Neo-Saiva scholars were at the forefront of historical scholarship that sought to investigate the culture, history, and social norms of an indigenous, pre-Sanskritic Tamil civilization, and the ""rediscovery"" of a wide range of ancient Tamil literature in the latter half of the 19th century offered a rich body of evidence for both theological and scholastic arguments about Tamil cultural identity. In opposition to the Sanskritic Brahmanical Hindu tradition, which attained an unprecedented degree of political and social influence in the Tamil country under British colonial rule, Tamil neo-Saivism eschews Sanskrit-language religious literature and Vedantic theology, instead recognizing a canon of Tamil-language texts and hymns including classical Tamil poetic literature from the Sangam period, the Saivite Tamil bhakti poetry of the NÄyaá¹Är poet-saints (6th-8th CE), and a variety of Tamil-language tantric and agamic texts with ties to non-Brahmin Tamil temple worship practices. Reversing the claims of Brahmanical Hinduism, Tamil neo-Saivism asserts that the worship of Siva is native to pre-Sanskritic Tamil civilization, and the Brahmanical tradition is a subsequent corruption of originally Tamil religious teachings. A resulting priority in neo-Saiva theology and scholarship is the re-establishment of putatively original Tamil religious, social, and cultural mores, a project through which religious ideas became linked to a distinct cultural politics. Notable Tamil neo-Saiva luminaries include Somasundara Nayakar (1846-1901), P. Sundaram Pillai (1855-1897), Maraimalai Adigal (1876-1950), and Neelambikai Ammaiyar (1903-1945).",1841,2020,1151,822,Collin Sibley,40,Stephen Christopher,2020-09-10 01:16:50.444 +0200,2020-09-23 08:51:49.275 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),4.509536208177937e-15,3.7477345727702324e-14,0.02758310339630283,0.18218570129479822,0.0037363963359084455,1.2722580152868628e-23,2.297631842345392e-05,3.1403661681492665e-22,0.7864718226545251

1011,Kingdom of Edom,43,Religious Group (v6),"Edom appears to have had two major phases of activity during the Iron Age (1200â550 BCE). Early in the Iron Age activity and social complexity was focused in the lowland regions of the Arabah and centered in large part on the industrial exploitation of copper resources in the region. This period was marked by primarily mobile non-sedentary communities, and as such, lacks substantial textual or settlement data. This entry focusses on the second major phase of Edom, dated to the late Iron Age (ca. 750â550 BCE), where there is substantially more robust data. At this time Edom was centered in the highlands of southern Transjordan around a series of small settlements and agricultural villages, dominated by its foremost city of Busayra. The region yet retained a large mobile pastoral component. Substantial textual sources for this region are lacking, so much of the relevant data derives from short inscriptions and archaeological data. Similarities in lifeways, social structures, etc., between Edom and its neighbors to the north and west (Moab, Ammon, Judah), allows for relevant comparisons and extrapolations to be made, particularly concerning religious practices. Similar to the other Iron Age polities of the southern Levant, many gods are attested in Edom, though the deity Qos (Qaus/Qws) appears to have served as the foremost deity of the land, its populace, and of the ruling elite of Edom. Qos appears to have functioned as a local variant of the âstorm godâ and/or âdivine warriorâ type. Knowledge of Qos is primarily restricted to short inscriptions and names. Evidence for religious practices (to Qos and other deities) can be found in individual homes, at poorly understood regional ritual sites, at several shrines (Horvat Qitmit and En Hazeva) and in a large temple complex at Busayra that likely centered on the worship of Qos and presumably a consort.",-800,-550,1208,842,Andrew Danielson,50,Andrew Danielson,2020-12-02 01:01:50.907 +0100,2022-01-21 22:03:04.663 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.00611213151801836,7.175198573055262e-10,1.1370325014011418e-15,0.001389423791564236,7.462620896655708e-26,3.86429750920324e-14,0.9924984437562336,2.166242474663453e-10,2.3166393021864857e-21

1024,Universal Salvation Ritual,43,Religious Group (v6),"Throughout pre-modern Chinese history, dynastic transitions accompanied by constant turmoil destabilized not only the social system but also social mentality. Wars, famine, and pestilence swept over the entire empire and left fields littered with corpses. The unpredictability of oneâs fate was further aggravated by increasing concern about the unstable boundaries between this world and the other worlds, thus opening up the society to the possibility of ritual manipulation. Aiming at bringing about the deliverance en masse of the souls of the dead and conferring blessings upon the living regardless of age, gender, or social status, universal salvation rituals provided effective remedies for helping the souls of the dead to gain relief from the fate of postmortem punishment and restore tranquility to the living. The idea of âuniversal salvationâ has long been a MahÄyÄnist Buddhist goal since early on in Chinese history. But it was during the late tenth century through the thirteenth century that it became prominent in both Buddhist and Daoist postmortem ritual services, such as in the Buddhist Water-Land Retreat (Shuilu zhai æ°´é¸é½) and the Daoist Yellow Register Retreat (Huanglu zhai é»ç±é½) in particular. Still practiced nationwide in contemporary China as well as in some diasporic Chinese communities, both rituals had their origins in the tenth century, but their textual elaboration and social spread was a product of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Most contemporary performances of the Water-Land Retreat in mainland China and diaspora Chinese communities use a four-fascicle manual entitled Shuilu yigui huibenæ°´é¸åè»ææ¬ (Synthetic Manual of Water-Land Rite) which is based on a six-fascicle manual entitled Fajie shengfan shuilu shenghui xiuzhai yiguiæ³çå£å¡æ°´é¸åæä¿®é½åè» (Ritual Manual for Performing the Retreat of the Grand Assembly of All Saintly and Mundane Beings of Water and Land) compiled by the Ming Buddhist master Zhuhongâsç¥©å® (1535-1615). But there is another Water-Land ritual tradition based on a ritual manual called Tiandi mingyang shuilu yiwenå¤©å°å¥é½æ°´é¸åæ (TDMY). The extant recension of the TDMY manual seems to have been compiled in Shanxi provinceå±±è¥¿ during the early decades of the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) by a Buddhist monk named Yijin ç¾©é (act. ca. 1368-1424), who most likely based his manual on an earlier text that postdated the Northern Song dynasty and found great popularity under the Jurchen Jin (1115-1234).
The Daoist Yellow Register Retreat was primarily based on the Numinous Treasure (Lingbaoéå¯¶) scriptural and liturgical traditions but had also absorbed elements of other contemporary Daoist movements such as the Divine Empyrean (Shenxiaoç¥é) and Celestial Heart (Tianxinå¤©å¿) movements. The name of âYellow Register Retreatâ first appeared in one of the âOld Lingbao scripturesâ (gu lingbaojingå¤éå¯¶ç¶) called Taishang dongxuan lingbao huanglu jianwen sanyuan weiyi ziran zhenjingå¤ªä¸æ´çéå¯¶é»ç±ç°¡æä¸åå¨åèªç¶çç¶and later in Lu Xiujingâs é¸ä¿®é (406-477) Five Sentiments [of Gratitude] (Taishang lingbao wugan wen å¤ªä¸éå¯¶äºææ), where it is listed as one of the various Methods of Retreats (zhong zhaifaè¡é½æ³) and second only to the Golden Register Retreat (Jinlu zhaiéç±é½). Mainly composed of confessions made to the twenty directions, the principal function of the Yellow Register Retreat at that time was to uproot the sins and transgressions of ancestors of up to nine generations (ba jiuzu zuigen æä¹ç¥ç½ªæ ¹). However, its full maturation as an independent liturgy was not to take shape until Du Guangting æååº­ (850-933) compiled the Liturgical Manual for the Yellow Register Retreat (Taishang Huanglu zhaiyiå¤ªä¸é»ç±é½å), which can be considered the culmination of medieval Daoist rituals for the dead.

1028,German Pietists (Hasidei Ashkenaz),43,Religious Group (v6),"The German Pietists (Hasidei Ashkenaz in Hebrew) were a group of Jews who lived along the Rhineland in the towns of Speyer, Regensburg, Worms, and Mainz in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The German Pietists advocated strict observance of Jewish law and, subsequently, tended to avoided Jews whom they believed did not follow these precepts strictly enough. Members from this community produced religious works, including a compendium entitled Sefer Hasidim (The Book of the Pietists) that contains legal and social advice, often in the form of exempla, for its adherents. Despite stemming from a somewhat isolated group, Sefer Hasidim reveals much about the daily life of Ashkenazi Jewry, with its advice revealing economic, mystical, social, pious, and cultural concerns. The groupâs foremost rabbi was Rabbi Judah ben Samuel of Regensburg, or Judah he-Hasid (Judah the Pious), who died in 1217, and to whom Sefer Hasidim is attributed. His followers included Rabbi Eleazer ha-Rokeah (âthe Perfumerâ) of Worms, who wrote an elegy for his murdered wife Dulce. This elegy has tremendous historical value for understanding the status of women in Jewish communities of Germany. The last active members of this group died by the middle of the thirteenth century.

1029,Zigao å­ç¾,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Zigao å­ç¾ is a short text written on fourteen bamboo strips that was part of a collection of such texts purchased by the Shanghai Museum in three batches in Hong Kong in 1994. The texts were looted from a tomb by grave robbers and their exact provenance is thus unknown. Similarities with the collection of texts excavated near the village of Guodian é­åº in Hubei province in 1993, suggest that the Shanghai texts may have come from Guojiagang é­å®¶å´ Tomb One near the village of Guodian, though there is no way to confirm this. The Shanghai texts likely date from around the same period as the Guodian texts (between 300 and 278 BCE) and the text of the Zigao itself was likely written in the 4th century BCE. The text itself features clear calligraphy but is partially damaged, with one fragment of the text currently housed in the collection of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

The Zigao is written as a dialogue between Confucius (Kongzi å­å­) and his disciple, Zigao å­ç¾, and in its own time would likely have been considered a ru å text. The term ru refers to a group of teachers and students who defined themselves by their adherence to the figure of Confucius, whom they took as their master. However, this group did not have a consistent philosophy and instead occupied a spectrum of intellectual positions based on shared ideas such as ren ä» (âhumannessâ) and yi ç¾© (ârighteousnessâ) as well as shared traditions such as the shi  è©© (âsongsâ), shu æ¸ (âdocumentsâ), and li ç¦® (âritesâ). 

In particular, the Zigao seems to have been part of an early debate over whether rulers should pass on the throne to their descendants or abdicate in favour of a worthy individual. The Zigao does not make an explicit statement regarding this issue, but focuses on comparing the sage-king Shun è (who, according to legend, received the throne when the sage-king Yao å ¯ abdicated) to the three figures of Yu ç¦¹, Xie å¥, and Hou Ji åç¨·. These three figures were the progenitors of the Xia å¤, Shang å, and Zhou å¨ dynasties, respectively. According to the Zigao, they were also all âsons of Heavenâ (tianzi å¤©å­) because they were engendered through divine conception and born through miraculous births. While the text suggests that it was this divine origin that established the three dynasties as legitimate, it also states that, in ancient times, good rulers abdicated in favour of other worthy individuals and that none of the three dynastic progenitors were comparable to the fully human Shun (who had no divine provenance). The text, thus, advocates abdication and lays the foundation for future claims that Confucius was the âuncrowned kingâ (suwang ç´ ç) by implying that he was the fully human sage most deserving of the position of king.",-325,-278,1174,708,Sarah Allan,6,Matthew Hamm,2021-01-18 21:12:19.629 +0100,2024-05-29 20:39:10.418 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.026672210645699787,0.013697217695309776,0.06253542152816081,1.2914374672307847e-08,0.006403746048146219,0.06408940366567752,0.826601987502274,3.5717921873477895e-13,4.164857736624817e-18
1030,The Way of Tang and Yu (Tang yu zhi dao åèä¹é),52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Tangyuzhidao åèä¹é (The Way of Tang and Yu) is a bamboo text of twenty-nine strips that was part of a collection of such texts excavated from a tomb (Guodian Tomb One) near the village of Guodian é­åº at Jingmen èé in Hubei æ¹å province in 1993. The tomb itself was closed around 300 BCE and would have been located on the outskirts of Ying é¢, the capital city of the state of Chu æ¥. 

The Tangyuzhidao cannot be definitively associated with any specific philosophical school in the Warring States period and is striking for constituting the only known argument to hereditary rule in Chinese history. According to the text, the only proper way to rule is for sage rulers to abdicate the throne to other sages when they become too old to rule effectively. In other words, rulership should not be transmitted through hereditary lineages but from one worthy ruler to another at a certain point in the ruler's life (age 70). The text illustrates this idea with the legend of the sage-king Yao å ¯ (referred to by his lineage name Tang å) abdicating the throne to the sage-king Shun è (referred to by his lineage name Yu è). The ""Way of Tang and Yu"" is thus the way of abdication and this phrase, which is first line phrase of the text, is used by the editors of the Guodian texts to refer to the text as a whole. 

The basis for the text's argument is the idea that the ruler (the ""Son of Heaven"" tianzi å¤©å­) is necessary for the ""natural order"" (ming å½) to be harmonized. A good ruler is thus equivalent to the sun and the moon, essential to the flourishing of the world as a whole, and able to encourage the service of worthy individuals so that society is governed by sages at every level.  The text further argues that abdicating the throne is thus a sign that sages do not seek to monopolize the benefits of rule for themselves but are genuinely concerned with the welfare of all. As a result, it defines abdication as the fullest expression of both ""benevolence"" (ren ä») and ""rightness"" (yi ç¾©). The text further links these two virtues to the practices of ""loving one's kin"" (ai qin æè¦ª, a practice that is part of the virtue of ""filial"" piety"" xiao å­) and ""honoring worthies"" (zun xian å°è³¢) respectively and thus denies that there is any possible breach of kinship obligations in the practice of abdication. 

Although the text exhibits some parallels with other texts, including both Confucian and Mohist works, its argument is unique and its discovery sheds light on the types of arguments that the Mengzi å­å­ and Xunzi èå­ were responding to when they offered their defenses of hereditary rule.",-325,-278,1175,708,Sarah Allan,6,Matthew Hamm,2021-01-19 05:00:05.621 +0100,2024-05-29 20:38:42.707 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.0018780519772335746,0.029038774396625572,0.7785433181048693,2.26220466902859e-08,0.04891503490779084,0.0058451293044773835,0.13577966868690225,5.435054867590632e-14,9.016310170501566e-18
1031,Eastern Roman Manichaeism,43,Religious Group (v6),"Mani, the founder of Manichaeism, was born in third-century Mesopotamia (April 14, 216 AD), which, since 226 AD, was a part of the Sassanian Empire. Living in the pluralistic environment of Mesopotamia, the religion he instituted contains elements of many religious traditions with which he was familiar, such as Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, and Christianity. Actually, Mani regarded himself as the last prophet in a long chain of prophets, which included Zoroaster, Buddha, and Christ.
The most notable feature of Manichaeism is its dualism. At the foundation of the Manichaean religion lies the doctrine of the two principles (also called roots or natures), which correspond to light and darkness, good and evil, spirit and matter. The Manichaean community itself consisted of two classes: the hearers or catechumens (the lay believers), and the highest echelons of the Manichaean Church, the Elect.
 Mani envisioned that his religion would surpass preceding ones by creating an ecumenical religion that would spread and unite the world.  Indeed, Manichaeism spread very rapidly through land and sea transportation networks, first in the Greco-Roman world (within a century) and later to the east, as far as China. In China, Manichaean communities continued to exist until the seventeenth century. In contrast, to the Roman West, it is argued that (at least as a distinct religious community) Manichaeism did not survive after the 6th century.

1034,Rongchengshi å®¹ææ°,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Rongchengshi å®¹ææ° is a bamboo text of fifty-three strips, making it one of the longest Chu-script manuscripts yet discovered. Unfortunately, some of the strips are damaged and at least one strip is missing from both the beginning and end of the manuscript. While it has some parallels with the received tradition, the text has no exact counterpart and was thus previously unknown to scholars before its discovery. It was part of a collection of such texts purchased by the Shanghai Museum in three batches in Hong Kong in 1993. The texts were looted from a tomb by grave robbers and their exact provenance is thus unknown. Similarities with the collection of texts excavated near the village of Guodian é­åºin Hubei province in 1993, suggest that the Shanghai texts may have come from Guojiagang é­å®¶å´ Tomb One near the village of Guodian, though there is no way to confirm this. The Shanghai texts likely date from around the same period as the Guodian texts (between 300 BCE to 278) and the text of the Rongchengshi itself was likely written at the end of the 4th century BCE, a point indicated by its resemblance to ideas of the late 4th and early 3rd centuries. 
 
The text is a work of political philosophy that articulates its argument through an historical narrative that stretches from high antiquity to the beginning of the Zhou å¨ dynasty. It is the only pre-Han æ¼¢ dynasty work to offer such a narrative. Moreover, it is also unique among pre-Han works in attributing the practice of abdication to rulers of high antiquity. Other unusual features of the text include the fact that it advocates a  utopian vision in which all people are employed according to their abilities and that it presents a devolutionary reading of history in which society gradually declines from high antiquity through subsequent ages. 
 
The goal of the text is to advocate for a political system that will follow the features described above and in which a meritorious ruler will use lenient and frugal rule to achieve harmony with heaven and earth. The latter point is particularly important as it indicates a shift away from a prioritization of the mandate of Heaven (the idea that Heaven sanctions the ruling lineage) to a prioritization of harmony with heaven and earth. Because of its devolutionary scheme, however, the text does not advocate abdication but suggests that, within the benighted conditions of the contemporary age of the Warring States, rulers should achieve power by garnering the allegiance of the common people. 

A final important feature of the text is the unusual list of sages that it presents in its opening strips (the textâs title is based on the fact that the first of its listed sage-rulers is named Rongchengshi). While the textâs list has some parallels with other works, it is not an exact match. The names of many of the sages in the textâs sequence, along with other features of the work, suggest that it may be more representative of the regional culture of the state Chu æ¥ than the common elite culture that Chu shared with the other states of the North China plains.",-325,-278,1179,708,Sarah Allan,6,Matthew Hamm,2021-01-22 21:05:46.065 +0100,2024-05-29 20:36:24.633 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.008130032467148579,0.07943467171177254,0.04636608219931536,0.14092708913137644,0.048071204672130496,0.3635466867347634,0.24602911244906195,0.0674948258372305,2.94797200606932e-07
1037,Third Intermediate Period in Ancient Egypt,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Third Intermediate Period is that represented by the 21st to 25th Dynasties of Egyptian history. It was a period of political disunity, when Egyptian territory was controlled by two or more contemporaneous lines of rulers, whose spheres of influence shifted over time. Some of these rulers held the status of kings, while others based their authority on their control of non-indigenous groups (Libyans and Kushites), armed forces and high religious office. For much of the period Egypt's political influence abroad was relatively weak, and the internal economy of the divided land was not conducive to the construction of elaborate monuments on the scale of those of the preceding New Kingdom. The evidence for religious attitudes indicates that there was continuity from preceding periods, and geographical consistency, with the same beliefs and practices being held by indigenous inhabitants and also by members of Libyan and Kushite groups dwelling within Egypt's borders. The Kushites also adopted Egyptian religious practices in their homeland (modern Sudan). Detailed textual sources for this period are scarce, monuments such as temples (or elements of temples) few and insignificant, and grave goods restricted in type and quantity.

1038,Sino-Muslims in Qing China,43,Religious Group (v6),"Sino-Muslims in Qing China refers to Chinese-speaking Muslims who were natives in China proper and regular subjects of the Qing state. Their history can be traced back to the Tang dynasty (618-907) when Arabic and Persian merchants began to sojourn in Chinaâs southeastern coastal area for trade. Many stayed and became Chinese subjects. After the Mongol invasion, large numbers of Middle Eastern and Central Asian Muslims further entered China proper during the Yuan period (1271-1368) through military campaigns and commercial activities. By the Qing (1644-1911), after several hundred years of reproduction, intermarriage, adoption, conversion (very limited), and internal migration, Muslims in China proper were already widely dispersed in villages and towns, in counties, prefectures, and provinces throughout the territory. In 1910, they had an estimated population of four to seven million.
Dwelling together with their non-Muslim (mostly Han Chinese) neighbors for long, these Muslims spoke Chinese, pursued Confucian social values, and embraced local customs practiced by Han Chinese. The Qing state found it too difficult to grant them with territory-based legal autonomy like what they did to Turkic Muslims and other ethnic minorities in borderlands. They were also not recognized by the state as a distinct category of imperial subjects, and were classified sometimes into the Han Chinese majority, and sometimes into Turkic Muslims. In occasions needing differentiation, the state might vaguely call them neidi huiminåå°åæ° (Muslim subjects in China proper) or hanhuiæ±å (Han Chinese Muslims). For convenience of analysis, contemporary scholars refer to them as âSino-Muslims.â
Despite their acculturation and their murky visibility in the state, Sino-Muslims in Qing China did not forsake or conceal their Islamic distinction in daily practices. They built mosques and Islamic schools throughout China proper. They travelled around in China proper and formed various types of transregional networks with co-religionists. They also widely published and disseminated Islamic scriptures and books written in the Chinese language. By the early 19th century, dispersed Sino-Muslims had been sharing common memory, knowledge, and discourse, etc. which contributed to a sense of collectivity rising among them, transcending regional differences within China proper. It distinguished them not just from non-Muslims in China proper, but more substantially from Muslims outside China proper. In terms of religious affiliation, most Sino-Muslims in Qing China belonged to Gedimu (the traditional Hanafi school of Sunni Islam in China). A small number of them (primarily in the northwest) began to be converted to Sufi sects since the early Qing period when Sufism was coming into China.",1644,1911,1183,876,Shaodan Zhang,45,Matthew Hamm,2021-02-02 19:39:16.803 +0100,2021-09-28 02:31:27.427 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),4.0654020198817436e-19,4.042561919308323e-15,0.007280171620271628,1.1203751184901787e-13,0.002064277845894991,2.7237421395214638e-36,2.3151087722382697e-08,1.7584238983176998e-23,0.9906555273826296
1041,Korean Catholicism,43,Religious Group (v6),"Catholicism first entered Joseon Korea in the early seventeenth century through books written by Western missionaries and their Chinese colleagues brought back by Koreans who had traveled to Beijing as part of government tribute missions. While some Korean scholars were interested in the science and technology contained in those books, they rejected the religion. However, in the latter part of the eighteenth century some reform-oriented scholars who questioned traditional Neo-Confucianism began to take Catholicism more seriously, leading to the baptism of one of their number, Peter Yi Seunghun, in 1784. He would return to Korea and begin to baptize others, so that when the first priest (a native of China) entered the country in 1794, there were already several thousand Catholics, including members of all ranks of society. Though these first Korean Catholics were heavily influenced by Confucianism, for instance, hoping that Godâs grace would help them become more filial children, the Catholic rejection of ancestor rites and challenging of traditional class and gender hierarchy with notions of spiritual equality, as well as their connection with foreigners, would lead to massive state-sponsored persecutions that would kill thousands between the late eighteen and nineteenth centuries. Though the opening of Korea in the last quarter of the nineteenth century led to the petering out of anti-Catholic violence, the Korean Catholic community would remain on the margins of society (and would face nearly complete destruction in the north following national division) until beginning around the 1960s when growth in the number of laity, nuns, monks, and priests; reforms from the Second Vatican Council that allowed the use of the vernacular language and other similar changes; increased educational and medical work; and highly visible participation in the democratization movements, led to a high level of familiarity and respect among non-Catholic Koreans. For instance, Cardinal Stephen Kim Suhwan would publicly challenge the dictator Park Chunghee for his violation of human rights and Thomas More Kim Dae Jung in 1996 was a key leader in the democratization movement and his election to the presidency marked the triumph of democracy in the Republic of Korea as it involved the peaceful transfer of authority between a party in power and one that had been out of power. While Catholicism has sufficient numbers and respect to make it highly visible in Korea, like other religions it is being impacted by demographic decline. Moreover, while considered progressive on issues of democratization, as issues of sexual morality are increasingly becoming objects of debate in Korea, the traditionalist stance of the Catholic Church might lead it to have more conflict with society. As in other parts of the world, Catholic devotional life focuses on such practices as attendance at Mass, reception of the sacraments, and recitation of the rosary. Notable characteristics include the comparatively larger choirs in parish churches (Korean Catholics tend to be excellent and exuberant singers), the importance of domestic pilgrimage (made possible by the large number of holy sites created by persecution), interest in saints (again, a product of persecution), and the dignified solemnity of liturgical practices (which are in part an inheritance from Confucianism).",1600,2021,1188,886,Franklin Rausch,45,Matthew Hamm,2021-02-12 19:50:31.710 +0100,2021-02-22 14:46:53.898 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.001436389408412549,0.04349245456468567,2.4205253401043623e-15,0.09946488263213588,0.004850084416834748,0.6940968980955915,0.00022582137595037981,0.15643341393136986,5.557501699752987e-08
1042,Zichiji è³æè¨,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"This entry aims to document Zichiji, a commentary of Dharmaguptaka Vinaya (Buddhist monastic rules) written by Yuanzhao (1048-1116). Zichiji is a secondary commentary based on a root commentary of Daoxuanâs (596-667) SifenlÃ¼ shanfan buque xingshichao (Xingshichao). Divided into 16 volumes, it is a complete commentary of Daoxuanâs original work, which is based on the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya. Like Xingshichao, Zichiji refers to various Vinaya-related texts and Buddhist materials and is intended to be used as a comprehensive guide to the Buddhist monastic way of living. Zichiji covers a wide range of monastic practices and management, such as ordination ritual, repentance ritual, funerary practices, daily management of the monastery, and the relationships with laypersons. Unlike Xingshichao, it includes valuable information on the Song Buddhist monasticism and Yuanzhaoâs debate with other Vinaya masters in his time. In terms of the transmission history of the text, multiple historical sources record that Zichiji was canonized during the Southern Song period. However, we do not have a material copy of any Buddhist canon which contains this text. The current canonization of the Zichiji can only be traced to the modern compilation of ZokuzÅkyÅ in 1902. The popularity of Zichiji is a symbolic mark for the beginning of an institutionalized Vinaya school in China. A litter earlier than Zichiji, Yunkanâs Huizhengji (not extant) was a parallel work circulated in the Northern Song. Yuanzhao and Yunkan demonstrated different interpretations of Daoxuan and the Vinaya. After the Yuan Dynasty, Zichiji, together with other commentaries written by Yuanzhao, did not survive in the continent. It has been preserved in multiple monastic libraries and archives in Japan, such as Otani University library, Seikado Bunko Library, and Kanazawa Library, and brought back to China in the modern period. The preservation of Zichiji bespeaks active Buddhist communication and exchange on the Vinaya between China, Korea, and Japan in the medieval period during the 12th-14th centuries. Exchange among different countries became possible together with the reopening of the maritime trade route interrupted by the end of the Tang and the period of Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms. Zichiji was studied in Japan as one of the foundational commentaries for the Vinaya and thus facilitated the Vinaya revival movement in Kamakura Japan. Yuanzhao, as the author of Zichiji, was commemorated as one of the patriarchs of the Vinaya school.

With the confirmed presence of Muslims in the region by the 13th century, Aceh gave rise to one of the oldest Islamic kingdoms in Southeast Asia and emerged by the 1600s as a center of Muslim scholarship during the reign of Sultan Iskandar Muda and several female âsultanahâ successors.  After the Dutch colonial invasion of the sultanate, Acehnese Muslims leapt to the forefront of religiously inspired resistance against colonialism during the long Dutch-Aceh War (1873-1914), established vibrant Islamic schools during the 20th century, and claimed âspecial autonomyâ status in matters of religious administration in the aftermath of their incorporation into the newly independent Indonesian nation-state in 1945.  Since the end of Suhartoâs âNew Orderâ regime in 1998, Aceh continues to forge ahead with the implementation of a distinctive Islamic legal and bureaucratic system (Syariat Islam) as part of its special autonomy status. Within this general framework of Sunni Islamic piety, Acehnese Muslims have embraced varied religious practices, textual traditions, political affiliations and approaches to the interpretation of Islamic law.

1044,Han Imperial Cult under Emperor Wu,43,Religious Group (v6),"During the reign of Han Emperor Wu (141 â 87 BCE), the imperial government sponsored the worship of a large number of cults, many of which were connected to the emperorâs pursuit of immortality. Many of these cults were inherited from earlier, Qin, practice, others were adopted from regional cults of the former Warring States, and others were entirely new. Rather than being a formalized group of religious specialists/practitioners, Emperor Wuâs imperial cult, meaning cults sponsored by the emperor, is better understood as a collection of religious practices, which were brought together under the auspices of the Han court, in order to access powerful spirits for both the emperor and his empire. The cults worshipped by the emperor, or on his behalf, were spread out across the empire, and the emperor frequently travelled to perform sacrifices or visit sacred locations.
The number of cults grew over the course of Emperor Wuâs reign, and there were frequent changes to sacrificial locations and sacrificial rites. This period of imperial cult is thus characterized by experimentation rather than as a coherent cult with a standardized pantheon.
Emperor Wuâs pursuit of cult was closely connected to his pursuit of immortality as well as to his imperial ambitions â the two cannot be separated. We cannot say for certain what type of immortality the emperor pursued, whether it was the avoidance of death altogether or transcendence, or some combination of the two. It is evident that the emperor believed that one of the clearest paths to immortality could be found by emulating the sage rulers of antiquity, particularly the legendary Yellow Thearch é»å¸, Yao å ¯, Shun è, and Yu ç¦¹, as well as following precedent set by the First Emperor of Qin.  Significantly, the emperor believed that it was important for him to rule over a unified territory in order to perform the legendary Feng å° and Shan ç¦ª sacrifices, which he was told, were performed by the Yellow Thearch before he became an immortal. As such, the emperor took over control of territory containing important cult locations, removing regional lords è«¸ä¾¯ and kings ç from governing over territories containing the Five Sacred Peaks äºå¶½. The emperor also attempted to access the powers of local spirits, mostly in the eastern parts of the empire, to not only access their mantic powers, but to demonstrate his authority over the spirits and land of the empire. Emperor Wu sought the advice on spiritual affairs from both within his own court and by recruiting outsiders who claimed access to mantic knowledge. These outsiders, whom Sima Qian classifies as Fangshi æ¹å£« (Masters of Methods), claimed to have specialized knowledge about immortality. Sima Qian, and others, were highly critical of the emperorâs reliance on these Fangshi, and many of the cults that they established were disbanded after the emperorâs death.
We have no information about the practice of these cults when the emperor was not involved, nor if they continued in some form after the period of imperial patronage.",-141,-87,89,870,Rebecca Robinson,45,Matthew Hamm,2021-02-16 03:34:51.195 +0100,2022-01-26 22:15:23.022 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),2.973277231792041e-29,1.0241848908840487e-35,0.9999999999989095,1.2367438031677398e-14,1.3985554957928606e-24,8.824628665018136e-49,1.3444682419999052e-16,4.765698381683893e-40,1.0779062518533768e-12

Over several centuries the demographics of this town changed considerably from an initial Egyptian planned settlement to a town inhabited mostly by the people of local and foreign Levantine origin. Eventually, the Egyptian government of the late Middle Kingdom lost control of its border provinces and a new state was formed in the Eastern Delta with Tell el-Dab'a (ancient Avaris) as its capital. The new rulers of the region belonged to an elite class known as the Hyksos. These men of foreign origin, judging by the names of most but certainly not all of them, ruled by taking over much of ancient Egyptian kingship ideology, titles and iconography.

1058,SyÅnggyÅng chikhae kwang-ik,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"SyÅnggyÅng chikhae kwang-ik (direct exposition of the Bible for widespread benefit) is a devotional text that was used by Korean Catholics from the birth of Korean Catholicism in the late eighteenth century to the modern period, during almost a century of persecution under the ChosÅn (1392-1910) regime. Specific authorship is unknown, but the text is presumed to have been translated communally by early Catholic leaders. 
The text is a vernacular Korean adaptation of three earlier Chinese Catholic texts (Shengjing zhijie, Shengjing guangyi, and Sheng nian guangyi), which were adapted from European devotional literature. It resembles a Sunday missal, with New Testament passages for each week of the liturgical year accompanied by commentary and prayers, and includes about thirty percent of the four Gospels, with Old Testament passages integrated without citation into many of the commentaries. 
Teaching about Jesus features prominently in the commentaries, and a secondary emphasis is soul salvation and the need for vigilance to attain heaven. Stories about saints and events from early Christian tradition, quotes from notables such as St. Augustine, and even maxims from pagan philosophers such as Seneca also appear. A linguistic feature highlighting the textâs transcultural origin is the occasional presence of a Koreanized European word, such as sibirido sando from the Portuguese espirito Santo (Holy Spirit), or belpâÅ­ng from the Latin verbum (word). 
Court records of books confiscated during arrests of Catholics suggest the text was widely read as early as the beginning of the nineteenth century. With little access to clergy during the period of persecution, Catholics in hiding relied on hand-transcribed religious texts such as this, read during weekly instruction at secret meeting places. State-sponsored persecution ended after a treaty with France was signed in 1886, and, in 1892, Gustave Mutel, the first bishop appointed to Korea, commissioned a new version of the text. Printed in movable type and renamed SyÅnggyÅng chikhae, Mutelâs version offered the original text tidied of marginal notations and supplemented by an occasional transliterated Greek term. This version was reprinted until 1938, and, along with SyÅnggyÅng chikhae kwang-ik, appears to have been read by Catholics until the Second Vatican council of 1965. 
As a product of persecution-era Catholicism, SyÅnggyÅng chikhae kwang-ik remained distinct from later Bible translations, such as the first Korean translation of the New Testament, produced in China in 1887 by John Ross, a Presbyterian missionary. Thousands of copies of the Ross New Testament circulated in Korea soon afterward as Protestant missions moved to center stage in Koreaâs modernization, while Catholics remained concentrated in rural areas where they had been hiding from decades of persecution. The first complete Four Gospels commissioned by the Catholic Church and produced in 1910 was translated from the Latin Vulgate, and later Catholic and Protestant translations containing both Old and New Testaments were based on the original Hebrew and Greek scriptures. These texts differed from SyÅnggyÅng chikhae kwang-ik in style and wording as well, due to changes in the Korean language. In effect, used by Korean Catholics alongside newer Bible translations during Koreaâs rapid modernization in the first half of the twentieth century, SyÅnggyÅng chikhae kwang-ik offered a unique link to the pre-modern, persecution era experience. 
Six hand-transcribed copies of SyÅnggyÅng chikhae kwang-ik dating from the late nineteenth century remain, archived in Seoul: four at the Church History Research Center, and two at the ChÅltusan Martyrâs Shrine. Each copy consists of eleven tomes bound in four paginated volumes, each volume averaging almost 700 pages, with 65 to 200 characters per page.",1780,1920,1198,887,Deberniere Torrey,45,Matthew Hamm,2021-03-10 19:57:47.694 +0100,2021-04-08 02:48:33.134 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.0003036857640932551,0.026341806773536147,1.778897188823537e-15,0.033433137816339595,0.00013187420492354575,2.2090623598624163e-12,6.549260936274293e-05,0.9113341694201208,0.02838983340941306

1074,Chuci zhangju,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The /Chuci zhangju/ æ¥è¾­ç« å¥ (The Section and Sentence Commentary to the /Verses of the Chu/) is a collection of verses written in the Chuciâor âVerses of the Chuââgenre, compiled and annotated by Wang Yi çé¸ (fl. 130â140 CE), a scholar-official of the Eastern Han (25â220). The word âChuâ designates the watery southern region of present-day China along the Yangzi River, at one point an independent kingdom before its conquest in 223 BCE by the expanding Qin empire (221â206 BCE). The founders of the subsequent Han empires (202 BCEâ220 CE) hailed from the Chu region. As one of the two oldest extant collections of Chinese verses, the /Chuci/ is traditionally conceived of as the younger, southern, and âromanticâ counterpart to the /The Classic of Poetry/ (Shijing è©©ç¶), the older, northern, and canonical anthology associated with the culture of the Zhou polity (ca.1046â256 BCE). The term âChuciâ can be used to designate both this anthology and the Chuci genre or style (also known as the /sao/ é¨·). Poems written in the Chuci or /sao/ style employ a distinctive meter and a specialized repertoire of vocabularies and formulae, in addition to references to the landscape and mythology of the south. They also tend to be fantastical and elegiac in content and tone. || 

Wang Yi ascribes the first seven titles (in the received 12th-century /Chuci buzhu/ æ¥è¾­è£æ³¨ edition), roughly the earliest layer of this compilation, to the archetypical poet of the Chuci genre, Qu Yuan å±å (trad. 343â290 BCE). An upright minister of Chu, Qu Yuan is said to have been exiled on account of slander and wrote a body of verses during his banishment, before drowning himself in the Miluo æ±¨ç¾ river. The most well-known among these verses is the first piece of the compilation, âLi saoâ é¢é¨· (Encountering Sorrow). Except for the final piece associated with Wang Yi, the remaining titles are attributed either to Qu Yuanâs purported disciples or to literary figures of the Western Han (202 BCEâ7 CE). The earliest historical event known to be associated with this text took place in 139 BCE, when Liu An åå® (179?â112 BCE), the King of Huainan, paid a visit to his nephew, Emperor Wu of Han (r.141-87 BCE), and is said to have presented Chuci materials to the young emperor (/Hanshu/ 44.2145). Wang Yi claims as the basis of his commentary in /Chuci zhangju/ earlier exegetical writings, which include a work attributed to Liu An. || 

Prior to its introduction to the Han imperial court, verses composed in the Chuci genre might have been employed in ritual and performative settings, although the extant poems in /Chuci zhangju/ are best understood as literary rewritings that indirectly preserve traces of the earlier ritual contexts. Each piece within the poetic suite âNine Songsâ (Jiu ge ä¹æ­), for instance, addresses a god or a type of spirit in a pantheon of deities, most of whom are associated with nature. Two of the three âSummonsâ (/zhao/ æ) pieces, such as  âSummoning the Soulâ (Zhao hun æé­), call upon deceased spirits, and might have evolved from funerary chants. âHeavenly Questionsâ (Tianwen å¤©å) contains over 150 questions concerning cosmogony, cosmology, legendary and historical heroes, including the kings of the Chu state. âFar Roaming (Yuan you é é) suggests a process of self-cultivation or even self-divinization. Some of the motifs and formulae appear to have religious significance, such as the failed quests for goddesses and heavenly processions encircling a mandala-like cosmos. || 

The formation process of the anthology /Chuci zhangju/ attests to the incorporation of this body of materials into Han elite literary culture. The composition of the written pieces in this anthology involves the reworking and re-interpretation of existing verses as the literary compositions of the scholar-official class, whose ethos is embodied by the archpoet Qu Yuan. Its later, imitative pieces, along with its exegetical writings, are centered around the political and moral concerns of the scholar-officials. Formulaic phrases that might have once been associated with ritual purification, for example, became metaphors for moral purity in the context of court politics. Since the Han, composing Chuci verses and imitating the /Chuci zhangju/ often functioned as a space of negotiation between political loyalty and dissent. || 

The /Chuci zhangju/ also has its legacy in popular culture. Folk worship of Qu Yuan during the Duanwu ç«¯å (Fifth Day of the Fifth Lunar Month) became one of the major yearly festivities in traditional and contemporary China. The commemoration of the drowned poet serves as the etiological explanation for customs such as the dragon boat race. || 

In existing scholarship, the Chuci corpus has often been understood through the lens of shamanismâtranslators from Arthur Waley to Gopal Sukhu have rendered the religious specialist âwuâ å·« as âshamanââwhich is nevertheless a much-debated interpretative framework. Due to the near absence of direct evidence external to the text, reconstructions of the time, place, belief systems, and practices of its earlier religious contexts are at best educated guesses. This entry focuses on the formation process of the /Chuci zhangju/ as a literary anthology in the Han imperial and elite circle, between Liu Anâs visit in 139 BCE and Wang Yiâs period of activities. It will nevertheless acknowledge the religious elements explicitly mentioned within the poems, such as its pantheon and cosmology.",-139,140,1272,878,Heng Du,45,Matthew Hamm,2021-03-26 16:21:33.872 +0100,2021-09-28 01:35:33.278 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),1.92350784609516e-13,4.244942629646078e-34,0.9918432309016603,1.62340534449414e-20,2.7520897555091684e-13,8.965764580815551e-37,0.008156769097872081,3.885393995083059e-37,5.381102009302825e-19

1078,Hymns to the Aten,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Aten was the pharaonic Egyptian name for and concept of the sun disk, visible and tangible, but also a supernatural power. The ""hymns to the Aten"" are hieroglyphic texts written on the walls of the monumental private rock-cut tombs of Akhetaton (today called ""Amarna""), a place located in Middle Egypt, which has been the capital (at least cultic capital and home of the court, while Memphis might still have been the economic capital) during the reign of Akhenaten (ca. 1352-1336 B.C.E.). The so-called ""Amarna period"" is generally conceptualized as a time of monotheism, but could rather be seen as a time of henotheism or monolatry. Akhenaten built Akhetaten as a place to worship the Aten exclusively.
The language of the texts is Middle Egyptian with elements of Late Egyptian.
The most extensive version of the ""hymns to the Aten"" is called the ""Great hymn to the Aten"" and is inscribed into the western/right thickness of the entrance of Tomb No. 25 (=TA 25), belonging to Ay and Tiy. The ""Short hymn to the Aten"" is inscribed into the thicknesses of the entrance doorways of five other tombs (Meryra I, TA 04; Tutu, TA 08; Mahu, TA 09; Apy, TA 10; Any, TA 23, ) and in one of these tombs (Mahu, TA 09) written on two stelae as well. The texts are always combined with depictions in relief of the tomb owners  in a position of adoration, sometimes depictions of the royal family are located above the text. The tomb owners held diverse titles, but only Ay (TT 25) and Meryra I (TT 04) held priestly titles (Ay was ""Godâs Father"" and Meryra I was ""High Priest of the Aten in Akhetaten""). Panehesy, owner of TT 06, was ""Chief Servant of the Aten (in the House of the Aten in Akhetaten)"", but his tomb, as many others, contained texts which are generally not classified as ""hymns to the Aten"" by the field, but do express the adoration of the Aten (if only in the particular aspect of the setting or rising sun) as well. These other texts which were also inscribed into the thicknesses of the entrances are shorter (sometimes just very fragmentary, so that not much is left of them) and different in composition, so that they were not classified by the field as ""hymns to the Aten"". They do, however, express the same ideas and many words and phrases are indeed the same as those in the ""hymns"". 
This entry will answer the questions on the basis of all these texts from these tombs entrance thicknesses, which give praise to the Aten/sun, describe the qualities of the god and the relationships between the god and the people (see pdf ""hymns to the Aten""). The texts use the words ""dwA"" and ""jA.w"" to express the adoration and praise, they address and describe the rising (""wbn"") and setting (""Htp"") of the sun, the power of the sunbeams and their positive effects on all living beings, but also the times of night as times of sleeping like dead. 

The hymns to the Aten are private funerary texts, but inside and outside the field they are falsely understood as scripture of this period. The ""Great hymn to the Aten"" is often said to have been composed by the king himself, but there is no evidence for this assumption. It is also sometimes suggested, that this very hymn was meant to be spoken by the king, but there is more reason for the tomb owners to be meant as the speakers. 
Interestingly the king's tomb did not show any sign of a hymnic text; instead, there is a depiction of the sun disk atop mountains, ostriches or bustards, gazelles, and desert hares loping uphill. This motif can be seen as a non-textual rendering of a hymn to the Aten. It also makes sense, that the king's tomb did not give praise to the Aten the same way as the private tombs did. The royal tomb was meant to be closed for ever after the burial, while the private tombs were designed to be visited for cultic practice after the burial. Moreover, the private tomb owners' figures actually came into contact with the beams of the rising and setting sun in their location, being written on the thicknesses of the entrance doorways.",-1352,-1336,34,922,Janne Arp-Neumann,44,Caroline Arbuckle,2021-03-30 22:54:34.052 +0200,2022-06-02 06:59:51.141 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.0019746304577195725,0.014697087905554483,0.3255474521782721,6.168766460598311e-08,0.5606683267412959,4.706570203667995e-13,0.09711244102902243,4.8732350195996696e-24,1.1642595044180243e-16
1087,The Bogomils,43,Religious Group (v6),"A dualistic, Neo-Manichean sect founded in Bulgaria in the 10th c. Heavily influenced by the Paulicans, Bogomilism denied many of the basic tenets of Orthodox Christianity, including the Incarnation, the earthly miracles of Jesus, and the Old Testament in its entirety. Holding that the material world and all things of matter were the creation of Satan, the Bogomils were often at odds with ecclesiastical authorities in the Bulgarian and Byzantine Empires and preached a creed of active civil disobedience. Most of our information about them comes from polemics written against them, including those by Kosmas the Priest, Anna Komnene, Germanos II, and Euthymios Zigabenos. Only one piece of Bogomil apocrypha survives, the Interrogatio Johannis, or the Liber Secretus. Originally founded by an unknown priest in the mid-10th c. who took the name âBogomil,â which, according to Kosmas means âbeloved of Godâ in old Slavonic, by the 12th c. the sect could claim followers throughout the Balkans, Asia Minor, and in Constantinople itself, including amongst the elite. A core of ascetic practitioners adhered to an abstinence from meat, sexual intercourse, and wine. Actively persecuted throughout their existence, they nonetheless found many converts, particularly in the Balkans.

1095,Punjabi (West),43,Religious Group (v6),"This entry focuses on the people living in what is now the Punjab Province of Pakistan. Specifically, this entry focuses on the rural Punjabi village of Mohla, located in Gujrat District, between the time of 1947-1958. This time frame begins with the establishment of Pakistan in 1947 and ends prior to the substantial government changes of 1948. The principal ethnographic source for this society, Zekiye Suleyman Eglar (1960), selected Mohla because it was not greatly affected by the partition of India and the establishment of Pakistan, allowing for the study of traditional Punjabi culture. Most Punjabis are Muslim and follow Islam. However, religious beliefs and practices are not discussed in depth by the principal authority. Consequently, the present entry provides a general overview and is limited to the information that is available. Religious activities follow the Muslim calendar, which is tied to the cycle of the moon. Religious leaders include the village imam, whose role involves formalized rituals, and the pirs or spiritual leaders. Eglar (1960:71) states that âpeople know the fundamentals of their religion, which are so interwoven with their lives that they are a way of life to them.â The present entry considers the Punjabi religious group to be coterminous with the society itself.",1947,1958,1237,577,Emily Pitek,1,M.

1098,Shuzi gua excavated material,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The so-called shuzi gua æ¸å­å¦ corpus is a large set of unearthed texts whose earliest examples, according to some scholars, should date back to the Longshan Culture (é¾å±±æå, ca. 3000-1900 BCE), while the more recent belong to the late Warring States period (æ°åææ, 475-221 BCE) or even to the early Han (æ¼¢, 206 BCE-220). The term shuzi gua (ânumerical divinatory symbolâ, or ânumerical guaâ) refers to a sequence of specific numbers, including â1â, â4â, â5â, â6â, â7â, â8â, and â9â; their distribution varies synchronically and diachronically, with â1â, â6â, â7â, and â8â being consistently the more frequent to appear. Different combinations of such numbers are aligned one on top of the otherâcreating a sort of tower-like symbolâin groups of three, four, six, or pair of six; examples of shuzi gua comprising more than six numbers are extremely rare. Roughly one hundred instances of these symbols have been found on various types of unearthed artifacts, including oracle bones (ox scapula and turtle shells), bronze vessels, ordinary objects like whetstone or pottery handles, as well as bamboo manuscripts. Depending on the material carrier in which they are embedded, the shuzi gua are written in many different directions or even upside down, resulting in a diverse structural and visual mise-en-page.
Due to the presence of numbers and the sparsely appended divinatory inscriptions, these symbols are usually regarded by scholars, albeit to different degrees, as ancestors to the cleromantic practice related to the Zhouyi å¨æ (Zhou Changes, also known as the Yijing æç¶, Book of Changes) and to milfoil divination. The Zhouyi, or simply the Yi æ (Changes), is a divination manual which has been canonised in 136 BCE, becoming the first among the so-called Confucian classics. Its basic constituent are the 64 Hexagrams, i.e. six-line diagrams which are supposed to owe their symbolic origin to the ancient Chinese cosmic concept of the Two Primary Forces: yin é° (the yielding, the dark, the feminine, represented by even numbers and the âbroken lineâ  ), and yang é½ (the rigid, the light, the masculine, represented by odd numbers and the âunbroken lineâ  ). The first scholar who systematically linked the shuzi gua to the Zhouyi was Zhang Zhenglang å¼µæ¿çº (1912â2005). In his article, published in 1980, he applied the odd/yang-even/yin dyadic interpretive scheme to convert each shuzi gua to the hexagrams of the Yi tradition. Prior to Zhang Zhenglang ground-breaking contribution, many scholars have long debated over the nature of what was then called âqizi å¥å­â (strange graphs), without reaching a consensus. 
In the last decades, thanks to the acquisition of an increasing number of excavated texts, the literature on shuzi gua has thrived, and the hypothesis of a direct connection between these symbols and the Yi tradition has been questioned on several occasions (Xing Wen é¢æ 2003; Li Zongkun æå®ç 2006; Wu Yong å´å 2006; Wang Huaping çåå¹³ & Zhou Yan å¨ç2015). The situation changed with the publication in 2013 of the bamboo manuscript titled by the editors Shifa ç­®æ³ (Method of Milfoil Divination; ca. fourth century BCE). The importance of this manuscript mainly lies in the fact that it provides the earliest evidence of the application of the odd/even dyadic scheme to the numerical gua; therefore, it establishes a structural relationship between the late fourth century BCE divinatory practices and the Yi tradition (Cook & BreÃ rd 2019). Whether or not this scheme could be applied to the earlier materials is not clear as, unfortunately, we lack most of the contextual information concerning their production, nature, and ritual significance (Jia Lianxiang è³é£ç¿ 2014; Wang & Zhou 2015; Bian Xiaobing éæå°. 2016).",-1200,300,1240,906,Flaminia Pischedda,45,Matthew Hamm,2021-05-17 19:34:22.758 +0200,2021-09-28 02:04:15.700 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.0010002910392249537,0.20421580523677696,0.15192772083910835,0.10322069687113346,0.4223894324923977,0.03710919833781231,0.06912679916505961,0.011009569653808506,4.863646782016801e-07
1101,Natchez,43,Religious Group (v6),"Historically, the Natchez occupied the area around what is now the Old St. Catherineâs Creek and the city of Natchez, Mississippi. The Natchez have had contact with Christian Europeans beginning with Spanish conquistadors as early as the sixteenth century, followed by the arrival of the French in the late seventeenth century (Lorenz, 2020). This entry focuses on the Natchez around the time of 1718, before significant cultural change and the end of autonomous authority. Natchez religious beliefs center around a supreme high god or spirit known as Coyocop-chill who is described as a creator deity and is associated with the Sun. Other spirits and supernatural beings are present and ultimately ruled by Coyocop-chil. Natchez beliefs state that a man and woman, as earthly manifestations of the supreme high god, came to the Natchez and brought with them fire from the sun as well as customs and rules of governance and descent (Lorenz, 2020). The descendants of these godly individuals comprise the royal class, and the hereditary position of paramount chief is passed through this lineage. The paramount chief, or Great Sun, is both the political and religious leader. The supreme spirit is said to reside in the Great Sun. A temple contains the sacred fire brought from the sun; the Great Sun and temple guardians are tasked with ensuring the fire burns eternally.

1108,Early Christianity and Monasticism in Egypt,43,Religious Group (v6),"Christian Church tradition in Egypt goes back to the 1st century CE with St. Mark as the first bishop of Alexandria. Historically, with Clement of Alexandria (c. 150-c. 215) Christianity is clearly an established, although minority, religion. The 3rd and 4th centuries show a Church and communities with eminent theologians, clergy, and monastics such as Origen (c. 184-c. 253) and Athanasius (295/9-373). The New Testament shows the ""ascetic tendency"" of Christianity in the 1st c. Athanasius' Life of Antony probably shows that before Antony, ""the father of monasticism"" (c. 251-356), there were village ascetics in Egypt. By the time of Pachomius (c. 292-346) and Shenoute (c. 346-465), there were dozens, perhaps hundreds of monastic communities, with probably thousands of male and female monastics.

1109,Chan Buddhism in the Song,43,Religious Group (v6),"Originating from the early Mahayanian meditation (Skr. Dyana) practices, Chanç¦ª Buddhism gradually developed into a highly indigenous form in China since the sixth century. A famous, yet simplistic, four-part motto adapted from the Platform Sutra has been widely used by Chan communities to characterize the Chan idealogy: âspecial transmission outside the scriptures; not established upon words; directly pointing to human heart-mind; realizing the Buddhahood by seeing oneâs Buddha-nature.â Chinese Chan Buddhism reached new heights during the Song. Unlike the decline of many Buddhist schools following the unrest of the late-Tang period (mid 8th-9th cent.), the Chan school continued to gain popularity during the turmoil times of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms (907-979). To enhance their political regimes, regional rulers in southern China began to sponsor, instead of individual monks, multiple generations of Chan masters belonging to the same lineage. This pattern of state endorsement of Chan lineage families, institutions, and literature continued into the new dynasty of Song, which became a hallmark of Song Chan Buddhism. 

  The picture of a âGolden Age of Chanâ embodied by noble Tang masters as painted in Chan literature has led to a long-standing stereotype that deterioration characterized much of the Song Chan Buddhism. However, behind such narratives reconstructed by the Song authors, modern scholars have begun to acknowledge that it was during the Song that the Chan school took its fully mature form. Intellectual and artistic achievements associated with Song Chan Buddhism have significantly enhanced Chinese culture in general. New developments within Song Chan Buddhism have had a profound impact on the Chan traditions (Jpn. Zen; Krn. Seon) throughout East Asia. 

  Compared to its earlier stages, Song Chan Buddhism presented many new features that would continue to dominate the Chinese religious landscape for several more centuries. First and foremost, Song Chan Buddhism distinguished itself by the advent and expansion of new styles of Chan literature: Gongâanå¬æ¡ (Jpn. Koan), or âpublic cases,â are short stories of a Chan masterâs commentaries on a previous dialogue or vignette of a past Chan patriarch. Gongâan became a standardized Chan literature genre from the eleventh century and was used largely as a pedagogical tool to elicit doubt and sudden enlightenment from the disciples. Yuluèªé, or ârecorded sayings,â documents the sayings of great Chan masters and were popular among both monastic communities and elite sponsors. Qingguiæ¸è¦, or ârules of purity,â provides detailed guidance for Chan monastic life. Dengluçé, or âlamp histories,â are narratives of a fairly coherent Chan family lineage starting from the Sakyamuni Buddha to Bodhidharma, down to the Chan masters of the Song. It was from such abundant literature that a distinct ""Chan"" identity emerged, emphasizing the lineage transmissions and the master-disciple relations.  Second, Chan Buddhism during the Song maintained unusual relations with the imperial circles. The compilation of Chan literature, especially that of the dengluçé, was under the collaboration of Chan communities and high court officials, often entitled with the name of a particular imperial era. It was also during the Song that public monasteries (as opposed to private hereditary monasteries where the succeeding abbacies could be decided by private sponsors and the current abbots) of Chan began to receive state sponsorship, official recognition, and political regulation with their abbacies appointed by the government.  Third, while many sects -among which the Yunmené²é, Linjiè¨æ¿, and Caodongæ¹æ´ were the most dominant- coexisted during the Song, in comparison with the competent histories of Tang Chan (especially the confrontation between the ""Southern"" and ""Northern"" schools), Song Chan Buddhism displayed a non-sectarian nature in general. The major doctrinal dispute, however, was perhaps the different approaches to enlightenment between Mozhaoé»ç§, âsilent-illuminationâ (enlightenment through silent meditation) and Kanhuaçè©±, âreflection on gongâanâ (enlightenment through concentration on gong'an stories), which were advocated by sects of Caodong (Jpn. Soto) and Linji (Jpn. Rinzai) respectively. Despite doctrinal differences, the rise and fall of Song Chan lineages, as suggested by recent scholarship, were more closely associated with the change of regional sponsor networks. Fourth, apart from its distinct lineage identities, the Chan school shared common monastic practices and rituals with other contemporaneous Buddhist groups. The syncretistic tendencies of Song Chan Buddhismâespecially with the Pure Land practicesâwould continue through the Yuan (1271-1368) and became more prominent in Ming (1368-1644) Chan Buddhism.",960,1279,1255,945,Xuejing Sun,45,Matthew Hamm,2021-05-27 19:35:50.990 +0200,2021-09-28 02:23:56.286 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),5.927061354830603e-26,2.6811919362353694e-35,0.9983229863750311,4.481230397582743e-21,6.954624791598159e-16,8.386421669912556e-49,0.0016770136248925845,4.2022870911057314e-47,7.5478915539429e-14
1117,Ancient Egyptian Book of the Earth â Tomb of Ramesses VI,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The sarcophagus chamber of Ramesses VI (Dynasty 20, c. 1145â139 BCE) in the Valley of the Kings, west of modern Luxor, was decorated from floor to ceiling, on all finished wall surfaces and three column faces, with scenes and texts from an ancient Egyptian cosmological work known today as the âBook of the Earthâ (ancient title unknown). This âbookâ was in fact one ad hoc collection drawn from a stock pool of imagery relating to the subterranean regions of the Duat, where gods and the dead were believed to reside. In total, eight royal monuments from the later New Kingdom (Dynasties 19â20) included elements from the Book of the Earth, of which the version of Ramesses VI is by far the largest and most elaborate. After the New Kingdom, elements from the Book of the Earth began to appear on non-royal papyri and other mortuary equipment. Scenes belonging to the Book of the Earth depict a wide variety of chthonic entities, whom the sun god â and by extension, the deceased king â was believed to encounter during the nocturnal portion of his cyclical journey through the cosmos. The Book of the Earth divided its scenes of the divine realm into two large halves, designated by convention as âAâ on the left (when facing the rear of the tomb) and âBâ on the right. The Book of the Earth was paired typically with images of the sky on the ceiling directly overhead, which might depict either anthropomorphized constellations or the cosmos-spanning sky goddess. Such celestial images were inherently directional: In the tomb of Ramesses VI, the sky goddess appears with her day- and night-time forms back to back, with her head in the west and her feet in the east. Extending the directionality of the ceiling to the Book of the Earth scenes on the walls below it permits us to identify the âAâ group, on the left, as the western half of the underworld, where the sun initially sets at dusk, while the âBâ group, on the right, corresponds to the eastern half of the underworld, from which the sun ultimately rises at dawn. Other important themes include the union of the sun god with his counterpart Osiris, the punishment of the Damned, and the transit of the solar barque through the underworld, personified as a double lion or sphinx.",-1145,-1139,1260,948,Joshua Roberson,44,Caroline Arbuckle,2021-05-28 20:26:05.876 +0200,2021-06-04 14:36:41.595 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.9999395561022443,9.370468917369238e-14,1.7729189556554355e-28,4.488692549814938e-16,1.799894655530991e-16,6.0443897599733734e-05,6.170109892054943e-14,8.124440280113873e-24,2.7918996807596517e-42
1120,Liji ç¦®è¨,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Liji ç¦®è¨, translated as ""Record of Rites"" or ""Book of Rites"", is a collection of essays on rituals and ritual principles written between the Warring States period (475-221 B.C.E.) to the Han Dynasty (202 B.C.E.-220). Scholars conventionally believed that this anthology belonged to the Confucian tradition and was recorded and compiled by Confuciusâs disciples. The received Liji has been said to be transmitted by Dai Sheng æ´è (fl. 1th century B.C.E.) in the Han and called Xiao Dai Liji å°æ´ç¦®è¨ alternatively to differ from the Da Dai Liji å¤§æ´ç¦®è¨ transmitted by Dai Shengâs uncle Dai De æ´å¾· (fl. 1th century B.C.E.). The Liji, the Yili åç¦®, and the Zhouli å¨ç¦® were known together as Sanli ä¸ç¦®. Nevertheless, the three Classics have different focuses. The received Liji has 49 chapters in total, and although they also touch upon various idealized rituals which were thought to be institutionalized in high antiquity, including sacrifice, wedding, capping, and funerary rituals, the Liji chapters concentrate on discussing the principles behind the ritual and social norms. For instance, the ""Daxue"" å¤§å­¸ chapter detailed the steps through which one could successfully govern the world, while the ""Liyun"" ç¦®é chapter illustrated how an ordered society could be achieved when propriety could be applied in reality.
Zheng Xuanâs é­ç (127-200) commentary on the Liji, which we can now read from the Wujing Zhengyi äºç¶æ­£ç¾© recension in which Kong Yingdaâs å­ç©é (574-648) sub-commentary were also included, is probably the earliest surviving and most authoritative commentary among others, even though revisions and criticisms of Zheng Xuanâs commentary can still be found in our available materials.
Recent archeological excavations have discovered numerous manuscripts which are counterparts and variants of the chapters being incorporated into the anthology under discussion. The textual parallels of certain Liji chapters suggest that the chapters (or even sections) of the Liji had been circulated separately and independently before they reached their current form. For instance, both the Guodian and Shanghai Museum collections of the Chu bamboo-slips contain counterparts of a chapter entitled âZi Yiâ ç·è¡£ in the Liji. The excavated versions of the âZi Yiâ are different from the transmitted one. Putting aside the difference in their wordings and lengths, scholars have recognized that a major difference is their sequences.
That Liji chapters were first transmitted and circulated separately and that there was the difference in the textual sequence of certain received Liji chapters were also acknowledged by certain Daoxue éå­¸ (better known as Neo-Confucian) fellows, such as Zhu Xi æ±ç¹ (1130-1200) in the Song Dynasty. Arguing that the âDaoxueâ å¤§å­¸ and âZhongyongâ ä¸­åº¸ chapters of the Liji should be extracted from the anthology, Zhu Xi believed that both texts were as of equal importance to the Analects and the Mencius and that the four texts should be put together to form the Sishu åæ¸ (Four Books). Zhu Xi even rearranged the sequence of the âDaxueâ and added a new sentence. Zhu Xiâs recension of the âDaxueâ and âZhongyongâ had become the standard version for imperial examinations since 13th century when Zhu Xiâs teachings were accepted as state orthodoxy.",-551,1911,1263,944,HinMingFrankie Chik,45,Matthew Hamm,2021-05-28 23:35:09.552 +0200,2022-01-25 22:22:04.280 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),1.2600687066565432e-13,1.5738507864388397e-14,0.8501278686012962,2.40724812204383e-19,0.04847641397375134,8.901529632506406e-25,0.10139571742481072,2.758041127372317e-35,2.0197649077451113e-17

1127,Anglican Church of Korea,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Anglican Church of Korea is a Christian denomination belonging to the Anglican Communion, the global family of churches with roots in the Church of England. Among the many Christian bodies in South Korea, the Anglican Church ranks among the smaller denominations, though it has experienced steady growth in recent years. The current membership numbers around 65,000 communicants. The Anglican Church is distinctive in incorporating both Roman Catholic and Protestant elements in its theology, organization, and worship. The church is divided into three dioceses, Seoul, Busan, and Daejeon, each headed by a bishop, and the three bishops rotate the national leadership as archbishop. Worship in the Anglican Church is similar to Roman Catholic practice, with ornate clerical vestments and said or chanted prayers. It also has monastic orders of monks and nuns. And yet, like other Anglican bodies, it is officially Protestant. The church does not recognize the authority of the pope and departs from Roman Catholic tradition in other ways, as in the ordination of women. Moreover, the Anglicans are different from both the Roman Catholics and Protestants in Korea in embracing more open and progressive views on such social issues as LGBTQ rights. In the past, church members have been active in the democratic movement, and one of the priorities of the church today is the reunification of the Korean peninsula. The first Anglican missionaries arrived in Incheon in 1890, under the leadership of Bishop Charles John Corfe. In laying down the churchâs foundation in Korea, they established churches, as well as schools and hospitals throughout the country. The Anglican missionaries and clergy emphasized sensitivity to Korean culture. They built many churches in the traditional Korean style, and two of their bishops, Mark Napier Trollope and Richard Rutt, were pioneering scholars in Korean studies. During the Japanese colonial period (1910-1945), the Anglican Church was unique among Protestant bodies in having both the Koreans and the Japanese, as well as the English, work together with equal rights. In 1923, the church established St. Michaelâs Theological Institute to train its clergy; it later expanded to become Sungkonghoe University, a major institution of higher learning in South Korea. In 1924, the cathedral Church of St. Mary the Virgin and St. Nicholas, the only example of Romanesque architecture in East Asia, was erected in Seoul.

1134,Tiantai,43,Religious Group (v6),"Tiantai was the first Buddhist school founded in China. Though it traced its origin to the Indian philosopher-saint Nagarjuna and ultimately to the Shakyamuni Buddha himself, its intellectual character was shaped by Zhiyi (538â97), a Chinese monk. Zhiyi made two sojourns to Mount Tiantai, a mountain in southeastern China, and asked in his will that the Sui Prince Yang Guang build a monastery there. The school was subsequently named after the mountain, which literally means âplatform of the sky.â 

The Tiantai School was not formed by the time  Zhiyi died, but Guanding (561-632), one of his disciples, constructed a Tiantai lineage by connecting Zhiyi to the historical Buddha, an Indian figure who had lived centuries earlier. This is considered by modern scholars âa watershed in the history of religious ideasâ in that it constitutes a defining element in the development of group identity and sectarian consciousness within Chinese Buddhism. 

The intellectual foundations of Tiantai took shape in a period when a long-divided China was transformed into a unified state. Zhiyi, originally from an elite family in the south, integrated Buddhism as philosophy popular among southern elites at the time, with meditation techniques that he inherited from his teacher Huisi (514-577), a northerner. As a result, Tiantai is characterized by a strong philosophical content and at the same time an emphasis on meditative practice; these are considered the two wings of a bird. 

Tiantai was deeply influenced by the Madhyamaka philosophy of Indian Buddhism and developed the Madhyamaka idea of Two Truths (i.e. the absolute truth and the conventional truth) into Three Truths (or the Threefold Truth): 1) all things are empty in the sense that they are produced through causes and conditions and therefor have no self-nature; 2) they do have tentative or provisional existence; 3) being both empty and provisional is the nature of everything, which is the Truth of the Mean. 

Tiantai believes that all beings can be divided into ten realms â the hell dwellers, hungry ghosts, animals, human beings, demigods, heavenly gods, voice hearers, pratyeka-buddhas, bodhisattvas, and buddhas. In Tiantai thought, these are so interwoven and interpenetrated that they are âimmanent in a single instant of thought.â In other words, in every thought-moment, all possible worlds are involved. For the same reason, after a doctrinal debate within Tiantai in the 10th â 11th  century, the idea of âinherent evil in natureâ or âinherent inclusionâ became orthodox. It is believed that human nature, as well as the nature of all beings, contains the nature of beings of other nine realms, which is to say, humans, buddhas, hell dwellers and so forth all have both good and evil in their nature. This idea distinguishes Tiantai not only from other schools of Chinese Buddhism, which consider the Buddha Nature purely enlightened and good, but also from mainstream Confucianism, which believes that all humans are born with a purely good nature. This feature attracted supporters to Tiantai in the late imperial era (16th - 19th centuries), who tended to challenge Confucian ideology. 

Like other schools in Chinese Buddhism, Tiantai as a religious group is not congregational and thus its organization has remained loose and its identity fluid. Except for about a dozen of eminent monks historically recognized as patriarchs in the Tiantai lineage, most monastics and lay Buddhists do not strongly identify themselves with any particular school and usually study under masters specializing in various schools. For this reason, Tiantai had been studied by modern scholars mainly as school of philosophy and doctrines. But this approach, equating Tiantai Buddhism simply with its philosophy, tends to eclipse the significance of Tiantaiâs social network, its contributions to Buddhist rituals and communal life, and other important aspects that more and more scholars have been taking on in their research on Tiantai.",538,2022,1278,962,Lang Chen,45,Matthew Hamm,2021-06-16 20:21:58.249 +0200,2022-05-24 20:47:43.372 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.002792013951553062,0.16339981417093596,2.2336962083530923e-12,0.8245300069372338,7.643107909292159e-14,4.428353803752539e-23,1.9993774205106166e-12,0.009118934784860299,0.00015923015110747333
1140,Early Medieval Confucianism,43,Religious Group (v6),"Early Medieval Confucians (Ru å) were individuals who were well-versed in the Five Classics (Wujing äºç») and their commentaries, as well as the Analects (Lunyu è®ºè¯­) and the Classic of Filial Piety (Xiaojing å­ç»). They viewed the founders of their tradition as the Duke of Zhou (Zhougong å¨å¬) and Confucius (Kongzi å­å­), which is why contemporaries sometimes called Confucianism ""The Teachings of the Duke of Zhou and Confucius"" (Zhou Kong zhi dao å¨å­ä¹é). Members of this group referred to their tradition using several other names as well, such as the Teachings of the Confucians (Rujiao åæ), the Teachings of Confucius (Kongjiao å­æ), the Teachings of the Sage (Shengjiao å£æ), and Teachings of the Way (Daojiao éæ). Many early medieval Confucians believed in the existence of spirits and all agreed on the importance of sacrifices. However, offerings had to be made to gods (nature deities and ancestors) sanctioned in the Five Classics and worship could not be excessive. The most important religious rite was the emperorâs sacrifice to Tian å¤© (Heaven) in the capitalâs southern suburb. Of course, there were some Confucians, such as Fan Zhen èé (ca.450-510), who denied the existence of spirits. Others, such as Huangfu Mi çç«è°§ (215-282), thought that the deities of Heaven and Earth were vigorously surveilling human activities and manifesting auspicious and inauspicious omens to reward good and punish bad moral conduct. Early Medieval Confucians put a particular stress on perfecting themselves by behaving according to the Three Ritual Codes (Sanli ä¸ç¤¼): Book of Rites (Li ji ç¤¼è®°), the Rites of Zhou (Zhouli å¨ç¤¼), and the Book of Etiquette and Ceremonies (Yili ä»ªç¤¼). Self-cultivation was inter-connected with social behavior: a Confucian cultivated herself/himself by fulfilling social roles and performing good deeds. Early medieval courts especially valued Confucians for their ritual knowledge and command of the Five Classics. As a result, they often served emperors as advisors on ritual matters, Erudies (boshi åå£«) at the Imperial College, and as tutors to the imperial princes. For early medieval Confucians, the main purpose of government was to secure the welfare of commoners and enhance their moral fiber through the process of moral transformation (jiaohua æå). This meant setting an example for others through one's personal conduct and establishing schools that taught the Five Classics and proper deportment. One did not have to hold public office to have a positive effect on others through moral transformation. Early Medieval Confucians frequently served in office, yet some, to maintain their moral integrity, chose to become recluses, such as Huangfu Mi. Oftentimes, they would then establish a private school at their residence. The loose social organization that underpinned medieval Confucianism was precisely the master-student networks created through schools. Early Medieval Confucians were by no means exclusivist. Several of them also embraced either Daoism or Buddhism. Although the inner chapters of Ge Hongâs èæ´ª (283-343) The Master who Embraces Simplicity (Baopuzi æ±æ´å­) are devoted to ways of seeking immortality, his outer chapters express a Confucian critique on social and political matters. Yan Zhitui é¢ä¹æ¨ (531-591) viewed Confucianism as the outer teachings, while Buddhism were the more important inner teachings. Nevertheless, other Confucians, such He Chengtian ä½æ¿å¤© (370-447) and Fan Zhen were vehement critics of Buddhism, while Sun Sheng å­ç (ca. 301-373) was well known for his criticism of Daoism.",220,589,1373,671,Keith Knapp,45,Matthew Hamm,2021-06-24 20:47:56.552 +0200,2022-01-25 22:08:58.149 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.6841511901397509,0.3016591180162892,2.363954507760889e-15,0.0016097191154286115,1.1206610388897971e-14,0.01257997162737892,5.240804379559747e-12,1.0958980525464736e-09,6.996377380590829e-31
1144,The Yijing æç¶ (The Classic of Changes),52,Religious Text (v1.0),"One of the most influential texts in Chinese and East Asian history, the Yijing æç¶ ( Classic of Changes) has long been known as âthe first of the (Confucian) classics,â the most exalted of the five texts canonized in the Han dynasty (206 BCE - 220 CE) in 136 BCE that formed the basis of the Chinese educational system until the collapse of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912 CE). The Changes originated as a divinatory text (usually referred to as the Zhouyi å¨æ, âZhou Changesâ) in approximately the 9th or 8th centuries BCE, one of many contending divinatory systems in the late Zhou period that scholars have only just begun to reconstruct using recently excavated texts. The basis of the Changesâ system is the âeight trigramsâ (bagua å«å¦), eight sets of three lines, each of which can be either broken __   __ or unbroken _____. Although several explanations have been offered for the genesis of these lines, for most of the textâs history they have been interpreted as representing the primary forces of the cosmosââyin é° and yang é½ââwhich combine in different patterns to structure every situation. These eight trigrams can be further combined into 64 hexagrams, each of which is composed of two of the primary trigrams. The divinatory system of the Changes involves randomly generating a hexagram, usually using yarrow stalks or coins, and then interpreting it in relation to a specific question or situation. The Zhouyi contains depictions of all 64 hexagrams along with their names, âline statementsâ (yaoci ç»è¾­), and âjudgementsâ (tuan å½) to aide readers in interpreting them. In the Han dynasty, the Zhouyi was combined with a set of texts referred to as the âTen Wingsâ (shiyi åç¿¼). The Ten Wings are ten commentaries, written hundreds of years after the Zhouyi by multiple authors, which elucidate the basic text of the Zhouyi and articulate a moral and cosmological vision. These commentaries were typically ascribed to Confucius and shaped interpretations of the Changes throughout the imperial era (221 BCE â 1912 CE). According to the Ten Wings, the Changes provides its users with insight into the natural, impersonal patterns of the cosmos in order to allow practitioners to harmonize with those patterns and act appropriately in any given situation (Smith 2012, 3). Over time, thousands of additional commentaries were written by different authors under different historical, intellectual, philosophical, and religious circumstances. In all of these contexts, the Changes reflected the mentalities of its adherents, resulting in as many interpretations as interpreters and creating an intellectual tradition far more nuanced and complex than the intellectual categories familiar to most Sinologists. Indeed, this diversity is such that the editors of the Siku quanshu ååº«å¨æ¸ (Complete Collection of the Four Treasuries) in the Qing dynasty claimed that âinterpreting the Classic of Changes is like playing chess: no two games are alike, and there are infinite possibilitiesâ (Smith 2008, 1). In addition, the Changes has exerted a formative influence on all aspects of Chinese culture, ranging from aesthetics to politics to law. It has further influenced the cultures of Vietnam, Tibet, Japan, and Korea, all of which have produced their own interpretations and transformations of the text. More recently, the Changes has spread throughout the globe and has been interpreted in relation to topics as diverse as modern psychology, mathematics, and biology. As a result, the transnational text of the Changes deserves to be thought of as âone of the great classics of world literature, on a par with religious classics such as the Bible, the Talmud, the Qurâan, the Bhagavad Gita, and the Lotus Sutraâ (Smith 2012, 13).",-1554,2021,1290,708,Richard Smith,6,Matthew Hamm,2021-06-28 22:12:46.141 +0200,2021-08-19 18:26:51.817 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.0005856714738124346,0.17305035206918576,0.38415165194993756,0.18979524274557474,0.18014233220701165,0.015380228022783547,0.05217944735441398,0.004714710978776722,3.631985035086497e-07
1149,Christianity in Tang China,43,Religious Group (v6),"Christians in Tang China gave a Chinese name for Christianity: Jingjiao æ¯æ, a term translated as ""the Luminous Religion/Teaching"" or ""the Illustrious Religion"" or ""the Brilliant Teaching"". Not a few scholars regard it as a ""Nestorian"" Church, a derogatory term used to call the Church of the East or East Syriac Christianity in the Western ecclesiastical traditions (Latin West and Greek East). The degree to which the Church of the East has to do with the Archbishop of Constantinople, Nestorius, who was condemned as a heresiarch during the Council of Ephesus (431), is a point that has been re-examined by a few patristic scholars. With the help of newly-discovered materials in Syriac, scholars such as James F. Bethune-Baker, Robert V. Sellers, Aloys Grillmeier, and Sebastian P. Brock began to question this ingrained preconception from the Western perspective. Scholars like Brock emphasize that the Syriac tradition, of which the Church of the East is a part, has a much earlier history than the so-called Nestorianism.

The story of Christianity in Tang China begins in 635 with the coming of Aluoben é¿ç¾æ¬, a Persianæ³¢æ¯/Daqinå¤§ç§¦ monk who introduced his religion in front of the second emperor of the dynasty and paved the way for the spread of Christianity in the confines of the Tang empire. This story is recorded on the famous Christian stele discovered at Xi'an in 1623/5. The text of the inscription was composed by Jingjing æ¯æ·¨, who was a priest and chorespiscopus of China. The stone was set in place in 781 probably in or near the Jingjiao temple in the imperial capital Chang'an (today's Xi'an). It proffers a brief history of Jingjiao in 146 years, which arguably echoes the rise and decline of the Tang empire. The presence of Jingjiao in the Tang period was also evidenced by Chinese official records, such as Tang Huiyao åæè¦ (Institutional History of Tang), and other Chinese documents by Buddhists or Daoists. The history of Jingjiao came to an end with the issue of the edict of 845, which initiated the persecution of Buddhism as well as other foreign religions including Daqin Jingjiao. However, historical documents of the 9th and 10th centuries mentioned that a few Jingjiao Christians still survived in China after 845.

In the 20th and 21st centuries, more documents and archaeological discoveries (like tomb epitaphs) have been found, especially at Dunhuang's Hidden Library. These documents not only confirm the authenticity of the stele but also enrich our knowledge of Jingjiao. The understanding of Jingjiao and the community of Jingjiao Christians, as shown in this entry, is built on the Xi'an inscription and these manuscripts, despite being fragmentary. These Jingjiao documents include Xuting Mishisuo jing åºè½è¿·è©©æç¶ (âBook of Jesus-Messiahâ or âBook of listening to the Messiahâ), Yishen lun ä¸ç¥è« (âDiscourse on the One Godâ), Da Qin Jingjiao Sanwei mengdu zan å¤§ç§¦æ¯æä¸å¨èåº¦è® (âHymn in adoration of the Three Persons and of salvationâ), Zunjing å°ç¶ (âBook of Venerationâ), Zhixuan anle jing å¿çå®æ¨ç¶ (âBook on attaining mysterious serenity and joyâ), Da Qin Jingjiao Xuanyuan zhiben jing å¤§ç§¦æ¯æå®£åè³æ¬ç¶ (âBook of the proclamation of the highest origin of originsâ), as well as Da Qin Jingjiao Dasheng tongzhen guifa zan å¤§ç§¦æ¯æå¤§èéçæ­¸æ³è® (âHymn of praise for Great Holiness, attaining the truth, and returning to the dharma"").

In front of the stele and other Jingjiao documents, there was a community of Jingjiao Christians, who were mostly migrants of Iranian origin and spoke Persian or Sogdian. The bilingual (Chinese-Syriac) stele itself tells of their hybrid identity. On the one hand, Jingjiao was linked with the Church of the East in the Middle East. Syriac played a significant role in the theology and liturgy of Jingjiao. The hierarchy of the Church of the East is indicated on the Xi'an stele: both Chinese and Syriac names of the Catholicos Henanisho were engraved on the stele. On the other hand, the text engaged with the historical and religious contexts of Tang China by employing a few terminologies of the pre-existing Three Religions/Teachings (sanjiao, ä¸æ), such as Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism. This was the first attempt at transmitting the Christian ideas, such as Christology and the Trinity, in the Chinese language, more specifically in Middle Chinese. In the Jingjiao corpus, introducing the idea of the Only God, who Jesus Christ is, what the Messiah teaches were some major tasks of Jingjiao Christians.",618,906,1297,977,Dingjian Xie,45,Matthew Hamm,2021-07-05 18:27:49.833 +0200,2021-10-18 12:48:36.037 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.011367904964261372,0.054964818140992966,2.560425350034603e-15,0.09168017656922328,0.004484796563811232,0.6944993560836168,0.00019958521609381345,0.14280331334374363,4.911825432904669e-08
1158,Early Daoist textâCommands and Admonitions for the Families of the Great Dao (Dadaojia lingjieå¤§éå®¶ä»¤æ),52,Religious Text (v1.0),"This entry introduces one of earliest Daoist texts, the Commands and Admonitions for the Families of the Great Dao (Dadaojia lingjie å¤§éå®¶ä»¤æ). What the text upholds and criticizes, with the historical and social background of its composition, reflect percieved problems regarding certain aspects of contemporaneous practice in the face of community diaspora, from Hanzhong æ¼¢ä¸­,a region of modern southeastern Shaanxi éè¥¿and northeastern Sichuan åå·provinces to the Wei é­kingdom (220â266).

The Admonitions, which is deemed to be written in 255 CE, is the main part of a larger compendium known as the Commandments of the Celestial Master from the One and Orthodox Canon (Zhengyi fawen tianshi jiaojie kejing æ­£ä¸æ³æå¤©å¸«ææç§ç¶). This corpus contains the doctrines of the Celestial Master Movement (Tianshi dao å¤©å¸«é), often regarded as the earliest Daoist community. Followers believe that the Celestial Masters was founded upon the relevations of Laozi èå­, a Covenant with the Powers that was both correct and unique in the world (Zhengyi mengwei æ­£ä¸çå¨) to Zhang Ling å¼µéµ(fl. 142 CE) , the First Celestial Master, in the Swan-Call Mountain. So, Daode jing éå¾·ç¶ that was said to be a work by Laozi was adopted as the primary text for believersâ physical and moral cultivation. The Celestial Mastersâ base at the time was established in Hanzhong, as a theocratic state which was supported by twenty-four parishes (zhi æ²»), each of which was led by a libationer (jijiu ç¥­é). However, after its leader, the Third Celestial Master Zhang Luâs å¼µé­¯ (d. 216?) surrendered to the ruler of Wei, Cao Cao æ¹æ (155â220), the community was forcibly dispersed. One group of followers was moved to Changâan é·å®, modern Xiâan è¥¿å®and its surrounding areas, and the other group was moved to Luoyang æ´é½and Ye é´ where is near modern Handan é¯é². Luoyang and Ye are not far, about 364 kilometers apart.

As part of the surrender, Zhang Lu, was granted the title âGeneral Who Subdues the Southâ (Zhennan jiangjun é®åå°è») and relocated to Cao Caoâs Wei kingdom. Therefore, without a central authority, the power of the previous theocratic state in Hanzhong was somewhat thawed, leading to the system of twenty-four parishes being undermined. As a result, the theocratic state destabilized and the concern over the heterodox practices increasingly grew. The Admonitions was composed in order to rectify what was viewed as a decline in rules and corruption of doctrines. Given that it was written in the first person, some scholars have considered that the author would be Zhang Lu himself. However, such attribution seems dubious as Zhang Lu likely died before the Admonitions was written. Nonetheless, it is possible that the message was pronounced by a medium, perhaps one of Zhang Luâs sons, in the voice of Zhang Lu that explains why the first person pronoun was adopted by the text. This speculation was first made by the Chinese scholar, Hu Shi è¡é©(1891â1962) and then affirmed by Daoist scholars like Stephen R. Bokenkamp and Terry F. Kleeman. 

The text of the Admonitions describes what changes brought to the Celestial Masters after it relocated throughout the Wei kingdom and how to rectify the âincorrect practicesâ prevalent among the faithful. For instance, the Admonitions determined that since the fifth year of Grand Harmony å¤ªåreign period (231 CE), those self-appointed libationers, whose promotions were not emanated from the âtrue pneumaâ, violated the old regulations regarding the selection and appointment. The Admonitions cautioned that from the day of the release of the Admonitions, self-promotion was absolutely prohibited. Although the Admonitions was a criticism directed at the problems of the Celestial Masters, intriguingly, it ostensively eulogized the governance of the Wei and propagated the Confucian virtus that make it different from previous Daoist texts. It claimed that âthe Wei, receiving [the mandate of] Heaven, drives away and exterminates [the evils].â So, the changes of the rhetoric can be seen in Admonitions when the leaders of the Celestial Master were assimilated into the authority.

1160,Wuzhen pian æçç¯,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Wuzhen pian (DZ 263.26, j. 26-30 and DZ 1017, j. 18, âEssay on the [Immediate] Awakening to Truth.â Also translated as âChapters on Awakening to Perfection.â Its preface is dated to 1075, and its postface is dated to 1078) is a seminal Daoist inner alchemical work that underpins inner alchemy as the essential method for immortal cultivation. Inner alchemy (neidan, which literally means internal cinnabar, å§ä¸¹) refers to a range of esoteric teachings and practices derived from diverse theories including but not limited to correlative cosmology, laboratory alchemy (also known as outer alchemy, waidan, å¤ä¸¹) and the teachings of Yijing æç¶ (Book of Changes). Unlike the laboratory alchemy practitioners, who aim to achieve immortality by consuming magical potions made of minerals and herbs, those who practice inner alchemy focus on meditation. In meditative practices, they visualize the human body as a cauldron that refines the internal vital forces including essence (jing ç²¾), pneuma (qi æ°£), and spirit (shen ç¥) to produce an internal elixir, which will help them transcend. 

Wuzhen pianâs attributed author, Zhang Boduan å¼µä¼¯ç«¯ (987?â1082), was worshipped as the founder of the Southern Lineage (Nanzong åå®) of inner alchemy. The work was read as a commentary on the Zhouyi cantong qi å¨æååå¥ (Token for the Kinship of the Three According to the Zhouyi, DZ 999 and DZ 1004)âthe earliest Chinese treatise on laboratory alchemy and granted equal importance in the teaching of inner alchemy. Most sections in Cantong qi were written as tetrasyllabic or pentasyllabic rhymed verses. A few other sections adopt the Sao style or prose style. 

Influenced by Cantong qi, Wuzhen pian also adopts the form of poetry. However, most sections in Wuzhen pian were septasyllabic quatrains or regulated verses, which are poetic forms that became dominant in the Tang dynasty (618â907). It also includes a section of song lyrics (ci è©), a genre that became mainstream in the Song dynasty (906â1279). The Wuzhen pianâs adoption of the new poetic forms not only reveals the authorâs mastery of poetry but also exemplifies the Daoist treatisesâ achievement in introducing new contents to the literary tradition. 

The Wuzhen pian originally comprised eighty-one verses, which are divided into three sections: the first section consists of sixteen septasyllabic regulated verses that focus on the idea of âtwo times eightâ mechanism, which embodies the dichotomy of yin and yang that functions with hexagrams; the second section includes sixty-four septasyllabic quatrains that incorporate the concept of the hexagram in the Book of Changes and the last pentasyllabic poem eulogizes the ideal of the Great Unity (taiyi å¤ªä¸). Later, two additional sections were added: one section comprises twelve pieces of song lyrics following the tunes of Western River Moon (xijiangyue è¥¿æ±æ); the other contains thirty-two poems that elaborate on cultivation through Buddhist subjects. 

According to Zhang Boduanâs summary in the postface, the contents range from the teachings about âthe ranking of vessels, the weight of medical ingredients, and the control of fire-phasingâ to the method for distinguishing âthe superiority and inferiority, existence and nonexistence, and auspicious and ominous.â The textâs highly esoteric and symbolic language indicates that oral instruction by a master was required during the learning process. Inevitably, its obscurity also led to various interpretations, stirring much debate among later commentators. While Wuzhen pian includes certain guidance for sexual techniques, commentators tended to disapprove of such contents. Instead, they emphasized the teaching of inner alchemy and the textâs relation to the Book of Changes. 

Two sets of Wuzhen pianâs inner alchemical concept were considered essential in later receptions. First, it inherited the theory of dual cultivation of nature and life (xingming shuangxiu æ§å½éä¿®) from the Zhong-LÃ¼ tradition, a Daoist meditative tradition that was active during the late Tang and regarded refining oneâs nature (xing æ§) and prolonging life (ming å½) as equally important. Second, it absorbs the theory refining essence, pneuma, and spirit, which was promoted by the Daoist master Chen Tuanâs é³æ¶ (871â989), making these elements the key components for producing the internal cinnabar. 

Although the alleged author Zhang Boduan was active during the eleventh century, Wuzhen pian did not gain much attention until the mid-twelfth century. During the 1160s, many commentaries begin to appear, and the text itself becomes available in many editions. The edition that collects the earliest commentaries is a five juan version titled Wuzhen pian jizhu æçç¯éè¨», which is mentioned in Zhizhai shulu jieti ç´é½æ¸éè§£é¡, one of the most influential private book collection catalog composed by the Southern Song literatus Chen Zhensun é³æ¯å­« (1179ï¼1262). Some major commentators and compilers include Weng Baoguangâs ç¿èå (c. 12th century), Xia Yuanding å¤åé¼ (c. early 13th century), and Chen Zhixu é³è´è (b. 1290). The Taoist Canon: A Historical Companion to the Daozang edited by Kristofer Schipper and Franciscus Verellen provides a comprehensive list of Wuzhen pian editions and inspired works. 
About the later transmission of the treatise, the Wuzhen pian probably influenced the Northen Lineage of inner alchemy, which was represented by the Quanzhenjiao å¨çæ (Teaching of Complete Perfection). Louis Komjathy argues that the Quanzhen tradition merged with the Southern Lineage on the eve of the fall of the Song dynasty. It is very likely that the Quanzhen tradition also engaged the inner alchemical theories established by Wuzhen pian.",1075,1078,1378,936,Wanmeng Li,51,Michael Naparstek,2021-07-21 20:52:22.315 +0200,2021-11-12 20:00:37.598 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),5.340616888798435e-26,6.603264592417505e-38,0.9948122040654477,1.3205501577733843e-20,0.005178666705362806,2.4430006858088226e-27,9.129229189448695e-06,4.932533408732594e-48,7.365430921173887e-19
1162,Lingbao dafa,43,Religious Group (v6),"Lingbao dafa éå¯¶å¤§æ³, the Great Rites of Numinous Treasure, also known as Duren dafaåº¦äººå¤§æ³, the Great Rites of Salvation, is an aggregate of Daoist ritual practices. In the Daoist Canon, certain scriptures, such as the Great Rites of Shangqing Lingbao (Shangqing Lingbao dafaä¸æ¸éå¯¶å¤§æ³), classified into the Lingbao Daoist tradition have comprehensive descriptions and instructions for the practice. By using series of techniques like methods (fa æ³), incantations (zhou åª/å), talisman (fu ç¬¦), and statements (shu ç), it first applied to self-promotion to accommodate the body and mind with the Dao; and then, it was put to use in public ritual performance for universal salvation and expel demonic forces. 
The Lingbao dafa is a production of a combination of many new exorcisms and therapeutic methods in the Song-Yuan time (12th-14th century). Continuing the mediation practices in Shangqing ä¸æ¸ [Supreme Purity] revelation, the Lingbao dafa used meditation techniques like visualization, concentration, and inner observation for the inner body promotion. The Shenxiao ç¥é [Divine Empyrean] tradition was borrowed by the Lingbao dafa in terms of its exorcism through the Thunder Rites (leifa é·æ³). Attached to the view of deliverance in the Scripture on Salvation (Duren jing åº¦äººç¶), it built on the traditional Daoist Retreat ritual (zhaiyi é½å) to formulate many salvation approaches, mainly practiced in the Yellow Register Retreat (Huanglu zhai é»ç±é½).In the Lingbao dafa, the most distinctive ritual performed in the Yellow Register Retreat is the Liturgy of Salvation of the Deceased through the Alchemical Refinement (liandu éåº¦å). Because the Lingbao dafa featured in absorbing and transforming rituals from different branches of Daoism, Buddhism, and popular religions, it is hard for scholars to identify the exact relationship between the Lingbao dafa and other Song-Yuan new methods.
Although the movement of Lingbao Daoism appeared as early as the 4th century CE, the organized practice of Lingbao dafa was not formed until the 12th century. It was popularized in Southern Song China in the lower Yangzi River Basin, however, its spreading was not limited to Zhejiang æµæ±, Jiangxi æ±è¥¿, and Jiangsu æ±è, but also as south as Guangdong å»£æ±. The Lingbao dafa, unlike many conservative religious ritual performances, was a very popular practice among both religious specialists and non-religious. All people without caring for their social, political, and economic background could be a practitioner of the Lingbao dafa, even when they still kept their other beliefs with them in Buddhism, Confucianism, local beliefs, etc. Ritual masters well known for their practice or compilation in the Lingbao dafa trace back to the Ning Quanzhen å¯§å¨ç (1101-81, also known as Ning Benliå¯§æ¬ç«), çå¥ç (fl. ca. 1250), éåä¸­ (fl. 1224-1225), æéç (1239-1303, also known as Lin Weifu æåå¤«) and so forth. Moreover, the Daoist master Lu Xiujingé¸ä¿®é (406-477), due to his contribution in the composition of liturgical texts and normalization of early Daoist Retreat, his work on the early Lingbao tradition is a fundamental source when examining the Lingbao dafa. All in all, the Lingbao dafa was a medley of many new Song-Yuan Daoist methods; it witnessed the rapid growth of Daoism in the aspect of self-cultivation practice and public ritual service, thus, a valuable material concerning the Daoist ritual history.",400,1400,1307,969,Chaojan Chang,51,Michael Naparstek,2021-07-27 05:47:53.940 +0200,2021-10-14 05:25:03.042 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.007049521931263128,1.1762021878541328e-09,0.07501432664414966,0.022171384073336894,1.1912154067387329e-14,2.624162077034545e-24,0.8687409616163765,0.014027706645511725,0.012996097913147988
1172,Twofold Mystery (Chongxuan éç),43,Religious Group (v6),"Chongxuan éç (âTwofold Mysteryâ) is a Daoist teaching developed by early medieval Daoist monastics; the most prominent was Cheng Xuanying æçè± (fl. 631â655). The name Chongxuan derives from the fact that the Daoist thinkers, like Cheng Xuanying or Li Rong ææ¦® (fl. after 650), used their commentaries to the Daode jing éå¾·ç¶, and specifically to the expression xuanzhi you xuançä¹åç in the last sentence of the first chapter, to develop their own version of the four steps of continued negation (also called si ju åå¥, or tetra lemma), which had become known in China predominantly with Buddhist MÄdhyamika teachings, as an approach to realize Dao conceptually.// The earliest traces of Chongxuan thought can be found in writings and anecdotes from Daoists active at the courts of the Northern and Southern Dynasties (420-589 CE), it became popular in the early 7th century during the Sui é (581-618 CE) and Tang å(618-907 CE) dynasties in the capital Changâan. Furthermore, presumably because of individual monks travelling and spreading the new teaching, it spread also in Sichuan. Early 7th century Changâan saw fierce competition and heated court debates between Buddhists and Daoists. Multi-level interactions between Buddhists and Daoists, from the reading of each otherâs texts, to the participation in public debates, to the struggle for imperial support and patronage, was most probably the immediate background of the development the intellectual innovations of chongxuan teachings.// Interaction and competition between Buddhists and Daoists gained an important political dimension in the Tang dynasty due to the imperial clanâs claim that they, the Li æ family, were descended from Laozi èå­, whose surname was also said to be Li æ. This claim was an opportunity for the advancement of Daoism, but it required that Laozi (associated in his divinized form with the Celestial Masters tradition dominant in the north) be the principal deity. This was potentially problematic because Daoism, as it was proposed by the clergy of the capital Changâan, seems to have relied much on the southern tradition of the Three Caverns (a synthesis of the Shangqing ä¸æ¸, Lingbao éå¯¶,and Sanhuang ä¸ç traditions), which considered the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Commencement (Yuanshi Tianzun åå§å¤©å°) to be the highest deity.// To resolve the clash between these two pantheons, Chongxuan theorists turned to the most distinctive feature of their teaching, the use of the logic of the tetra lemma (otherwise known as the four-fold negation from), which they had adapted from the Madhyamaka Buddhist tradition. Combining this mode of logic with the Two-Body theory (a Daoist adaptation of the Buddhist theory of the Three Bodies of the Buddha), Chongxuan theorists were able to argue for the logical interpenetration of the Dao, apparently separate deities, and the sage. In doing so, they redefined Laozi and the Heavenly Worthy as âresponse bodiesâ (yingshen æèº«) of the Dao and thus unified the pantheon, making sure Laozi could be treated as the highest deity.// This interpenetration also enabled Chongxuan figures to transfer seemingly anthropomorphic characteristics, such as wisdom and compassion, to the ultimate entity of the Dao, which is inherently devoid of any specific characteristics. They thus defined the Dao as a compassionate entity that actively worked for the salvation of all beings and thereby responded to Buddhist critiques that Daoism did not offer the same type of soteriological benefits as Buddhism.// In fact, Chongxuan theorists developed a sophisticated soteriological model in which individuals could cultivate themselves and return to the Dao, thereby becoming immortal sages. Sages, moreover, were thought to deliberately return from the Dao to the mortal plane (much like a Buddhist Boddhisattva) in order to actively work for the salvation of all entities. They did so, it was thought, because they were motivated by the same type of compassion as the Dao.",500,700,1317,708,Friederike Assandri,6,Matthew Hamm,2021-08-19 19:13:01.151 +0200,2022-03-14 22:57:18.398 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.0602682481197517,0.00431452055572299,0.2723474087188154,9.349275266290821e-08,0.12084412635419317,1.333048297671728e-12,0.542225602757431,1.0577762206619108e-23,5.2901849921673385e-17
1175,Religion in Northern Hejaz,43,Religious Group (v6),"This entry focuses on the religions in the northern Hejaz and neighboring regions during the Late Bronze and Iron Ages and later (ca. 1500-300 BCE), the first time when there is firm archaeological and epigraphic evidence of local cultic practices. During this period the northern Hejaz shared strong economic and cultural links with the southern Negev and southern Transjordan, and the whole area can be considered a large ""cultural province."" The region is predominantely characterized by aridity and desert landscapes. As such, human habitation was traditionally based on nomadic pastoralism, while permanent settlements were restricted to the local oases, such as Qurayyah, Tayma and Dedan. The limited evidence of the local religions is restricted to archaeological and epigraphic data found in those oasis settlements and at the ""Midianite"" shrine at Timna Valley; rock inscriptions found in the desert; and the information provided by written sources external to the region, including Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian inscriptions and (problematic) biblical references. The local religions can be identified as polytheistic, although data is conspicuously absent regarding the existence of a pantheon of gods and about religious beliefs or sacred scriptures. The evidence of local deities is patchy and biased towards the epigraphic inscriptions of hegemonic oasis towns and external imperial powers. The earliest cultic practices are attested at the small Late Bronze shrine of Hathor at Timna Valley (14th-12th cent. BCE), where the cultic assemblage was interpreted as ""Midianite"" because of its cultural connections with the region of Midian in north-western Arabia. Biblical scholarship has seen in the biblical tradition of Moses' stay at Midian evidence of the Midianite worship of Yahweh, but the dating and interpretation of these texts are contested. At Tayma, a rectangular temple functioned during the early Iron Age (ca. 12th-10th cent. BCE), but it is not until king Nabonidus' stay at Tayma (553-543 BCE), when there is evidence of the worship of deities, particularly Babylonian Marduk and Zarpanitu. Local epigraphic inscriptions attest the introduction of the worship of Aramaean deities Salm, Asima and Sangila during the 5th cent. BCE, before and during the Lihyanite rule at Tayma. Several late Iron Age temples were excavated at Dedan, places where the local Dedanites worshipped gods such as Gadd and 'Ara'il; during the later Lihyanite period, deities included Dhu-Gabat, Ba'al-Å¡amin, Han-'Uzzai and 'Aglibun.",-1500,-300,1320,997,Juan Manuel Tebes,50,Andrew Danielson,2021-08-20 21:59:40.463 +0200,2021-08-27 00:29:40.558 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.1729722830159615,0.11411669040133103,0.219551476357973,0.12226638378562002,0.07441942972727648,0.013499460096953233,0.21880994222861327,0.014898963538393132,0.049465370847878484
1176,Shijing è©©ç¶ (Classic/Book of Odes/Songs),52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Shijing è©©ç¶ (Classic/Book of Odes/Songs) is the earliest Chinese poetry anthology, contains 305 odes from the early Western Zhou (eleventh century BC) to the middle of the Spring and Autumn period (sixth century BC). There are also six other sheng ç¬ (reed pipe) odes listed in the table of contents with only titles. It has long been called Shi è©© (Odes) or Shisanbai è©©ä¸ç¾ (Three Hundred Odes) until receiving the title of Shijing after its canonisation in the Western Han dynasty. After the canonisation, Shijing had long been a part of the study of Confucian classics instead of literature, for nearly two millennia until the end of the imperial era.

The Shijing is divided into four main sections: (1) guo/bangfeng å/é¦é¢¨ (airs of the states), xiaoya å°é (minor court hymns), daya å¤§é (major court hymns), and song é  (eulogies). Feng includes 160 odes from the 15 groups of the odes of the states. Ya é includes 31 major and 74 minor odes of the states. Song includes 40 odes. Shijingâs prosodic pattern is dominantly (ca. 92%) a four-syllable line.

There is a close relationship between the Shijing and performance in early China. These odes served originally as word texts for chanting, performing with instruments, singing, and singing to the accompaniment of dancing. The differences in musical features are regarded as a base of the division of the sections. Feng has generally been defined as local airs, bearing musical features of various geographical regions. Ya was also defined as proper, the music of the central states. Song was music used exclusively for sacrificial offerings in ancestral temples.

A few of the odes include the names of the composers. Some pieces are attributed to historical figures, but most of the odes are anonymous. The content of the pieces included the voices from a variety of backgrounds, ranging across men and women, commoners and nobles, farmers and soldiers. The topics range from daily life (courtship, marriage, agriculture) to royal activities (battles, feasts, sacrifices).

There were two theories on how the odes were collected but neither of them is confirmed: (1) The Han dynasty historical record Hanshu æ¼¢æ¸ (History of Han) claims that the Zhou court had an office known as the caishi zhi guan éè©©ä¹å® (ode collecting office), which was charged with collecting odes from various parts of the Zhou empire by recording odes sung by people. (2) The Guoyu åèª (Discourses of the States) and the Liji ç¦®è¨ (Records of Rites) state that the officials and musicians presented odes (composed by themselves or collected from various places) to the court. Despite the theories, it is certain that the odes had gone through a process of polishing, arrangement, and editing therefore the current form is somewhat uniform in form and language.

During the early Han dynasty, there were three interpretative lines of filiations of Shijing study enjoyed positions at the Imperial Academy and imperial patron, namely Lu é­¯, Qi é½, and Han é. Another line of filiations, the Mao tradition received such status only briefly under Emperor Ping (r. 1 BC-6). There is no decisive evidence showing the differences between the lines, instead, the lines shared some common grounds: (1) attempted to assign individual odes, or group of odes, to specific historical circumstances; (2) attributed to the odes a secondary layer of meaning in the more spiritual realm of ethical and political philosophy. Despite the long period of being out of power, the Mao Shi æ¯è©© and its attached daxu å¤§åº (major preface) and xiaoxu å°åº (minor preface) became the orthodox interpretation and recension of the text after Zheng Xuan é­ç (127â200) wrote the Mao Shi zhuan jian æ¯è©©å³ç® (A Commentary on the Mao Shi). The Mao tradition eventually eclipsed all other three interpretative lines so that their interpretations and recensions of the Shijing have not survived except in fragments. The Qi tradition had died out during the third century and Lu the early fourth. The Han tradition has one work escaped from vanishing - Han Shi waizhuan éè©©å¤å³ (Outer Commentary on Han Interpretative Line of Filiations to the Odes) - was no longer being taught at least before the sixth century. The recension and interpretative texts of the Mao tradition later became mandatory texts for imperial examinations. That is, the transmitted version of the Shijing after the Han dynasty became confined to a sole interpretative tradition: the Mao Shi. The transmitted Shijing was preserved only intact in the interpretative tradition of Mao. This was the only case where this happened amongst the Five Classics and the much later Wujing zhengyi äºç¶æ­£ç¾© (Corrected Meanings of Five Classics) compiled by Kong Yingda å­ç©é (574â648) in Tang dynasty and Thirteen Classics (shisan jing åä¸ç¶) in Ming dynasty.

The following listed some major excavated manuscripts for the study of Shijing. The sequence arranged chronologically to the estimated date of texts:

(1) the Anhui University å®å¾½å¤§å­¸ obtained a collection of ancient manuscripts dated ca. 330 BC. Among the collection there is a set of written Shi, making it the earliest version of Shijing by now. The slips of the Anhui Shi manuscripts are all numbered consecutively at the tail of the front side of the slips, from 1 to 117. As 24 slips are missing today, a total of 93 slips remain, carrying 57 odes. All of the odes are from the guofeng, thus the Anhui Shi has slightly more than one-third of the 160 odes of the âAirs of the Statesâ of the transmitted Shijing. Anhui Shi demonstrated a geographical western bias of the states. Not one of the eastern states and only one of the central states of the transmitted guofeng is present in the Anhui Shi. The sequence order of the states also differs remarkably from the received Shijing. See Dirk Meyer and Adam C. Schwartz, The Songs of Royal ZhÅu and ShÃ o: ShÄ« è©© of the ÄnhuÄ« Warring States Manuscripts (Berlin: De Gruyter, forthcoming). 

(2) the Shanghai Museum acquired in Hong Kong a large collection of Warring States period (ca. 300 BC) texts written on bamboo strips. One work, titled âKongzi Shi lunâ å­å­è©©è« (âConfuciusâ Discussion of the Odesâ) by the editors from the museum, contains what purports to be Confuciusâ interpretation of certain Shijing pieces. The Shi lun is, for now, the earliest discussions of the odes which differ fundamentally from all other transmitted and excavated interpretations. See Ma Chengyuan é¦¬æ¿æº, ed., Shanghai bowuguan cang Zhanguo Chu zhushu ä¸æµ·åç©é¤¨èæ°åæ¥ç«¹æ¸ (Shanghai: Shanghai guji chubanshe, 2001).

(3) two versions of the âZiyiâ ç·è¡£ (âBlack Robesâ) text which has a number of Shijing citations. One from Guodian é­åº (Hubei province) and dated ca. 300 BC, the other again in the Shanghai Museum. ""Ziyiâ is a chapter of the transmitted Liji ç¦®è¨ (Records of Rites). The citations and interpretations from such manuscripts play a vital role in comparing them with the numerous citations of Shijing in early China. See Martin Kern, âThe Odes in Excavated Manuscripts,â in Martin Kern, ed., Text and Ritual in Early China (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2005), 149-193.

(4) two versions of the âWuxingâ äºè¡ (âFive [Forms of] Conductâ) which has a number of Shijing citations. One from Guodian, the other with an elaborating commentary from Mawangdui é¦¬çå  tomb no. three near Changsha é·æ² (Hunan province; tomb closed 168 BC). See Martin Kern, âThe Odes in Excavated Manuscripts,â in Martin Kern, ed., Text and Ritual in Early China (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2005), 149-193.

(5) in a tomb at Shuanggudui éå¤å  (Fuyang éé½, Anhui province; tomb closed 165 BC), 65 odes from the guofeng and 4 odes from xiaoya written on 170 wooden strips were discovered. The fragments contain many variants that cannot be found from the transmitted interpretative lines of filiations. This version of Shijing is important particularly for the study of interpretative lines as it is dated at the time that interpretative traditions were flourishing and started to secure their imperial positions. See Hu Pingsheng è¡å¹³ç and Han Ziqiang éèªå¼·, eds., Fuyang Han jian Shijing yanjiu éé½æ¼¢ç°¡è©©ç¶ç ç©¶ (Shanghai: Shanghai guji chubanshe, 1988).

(6) over 1200 broken bamboo slips of Shi were retrieved from the main burial chamber of the archaeological site of the Mausoleum of Marquis of Haihun (Haihunhou æµ·æä¾¯) near Nanchang åæ (Jiangxi province; tomb closed 59 BC). Compared to the findings listed above, the preservation condition of such a set is worse. The original sequence is lost and many characters are damaged. Given the extent of the damage, the arrangement of the slips is inevitably confined under the shadow of the transmitted Mao recension. Despite the adverse condition, the discovery is phenomenal for the study of Han interpretative traditions as the only recorded Shi teacher of the Marquis of Haihun was a teaching master of the Lu interpretative line of filiation. The Haihun Shi is thus being regarded as the first and complete recension of the long lost Lu Shi.

1178,Modern Mystery School (MMS),43,Religious Group (v6),"Modern Mystery School (MMS), formerly known as the Rocky Mountain Mystery School (RMMS), is variously described as a spiritual path, a spiritual business, and a spiritual lineage. It was founded in 1997 by Gudni Gudnason and is headquartered in Toronto and Tokyo. MMS emerged in Japan at the height of the âspirituality boomâ and the proliferation of spiritual therapeutic techniques that are often associated with the eclectic categories of Western esotericism or New Age. 
MMS teaches that there are seven Mystery Schools in the world where esoteric knowledge is transmitted in a continuous linage for thousands of years. While these Mystery Schools are closed and shrouded in secrecy, MMS advertises âno more secretsâ and provides open initiation through an ascending spiritual syllabus. 

The course material is remarkably ecumenical, drawing from Kabbalah, Theosophy, Wicca, Mikkyo, Tibetan Buddhism, Christianity, ancient Egyptian cosmologies, Norse mythology, Tarot and Reiki (among others). Tibetan ritual objects (purbha) and concepts (Shambhala) are central to ritual practice and MMS eschatology, as are ritual swords based on knighthood from European classical antiquity. Workshops and seminars are offered at both MMS headquarters and in hundreds of spiritual salons (saron). 

Upon completion of one of seven initiatory steps (Adept, Healer, Ritual Master 1, 2, 2.5, and 3, culminating with Guide), initiates are awarded certifications and are empowered by MMS to practice and teach specific modalities. This system of spiritual credentialism, which allows students to become teachers (called Healers or Guides) who enlist their own paying clients, complicates traditional ideas of 'the religious' and blurs the distinction between belief and business. For more recent theorization of the exchanges of spirituality and materiality, see BBB under 'Online Sources'. There is an ongoing debate, playing out on social media, traditional print media, and various online forums, about the business model of MMS (see 'Online Sources' for a sample). 

MMS teachings are diverse and have flexible canonicity based on Mr. Gudnason revealing new modalities and making eschatological prophesies. There is no formal canon of scripture, although the Hermetica and Kabbalah are central. âThe Cherubimâs Flamesâ is a booklet of ritual incantations and mantras published by MMS and used by initiates. MMS primarily gives oral teachings, available in seminars, following in the tradition of the Mystery School for thousands of years, as described by Mr. Gudnason. Prominent teachings include both the universal realization of humanityâs oneness as Galactic Beings and the self-realization of our own individuality. 

Through guided workshops with a focus on aesthetics, self-branding and self-based leadership (Knowing Thyself), initiates (especially in Japan) are encouraged to increasingly individualize: to discover their unique âchanneling contractâ with a specific deity (the Channeling School is only available in Japan); to be given a personalized Ritual Master name by a lineage Ipsissimus during the 2nd-step Ritual Master initiation ceremony that speaks to their unique mission on Earth; and to âfind joyâ through reconnecting with sources of daily pleasure. Guides are encouraged to embrace the ""Royal Life"" by discovering their unique embodiment of divinity and their truest self-presentation. This can include beautifying interior designs of homes and spiritual salons, an overall material upgrade in the quality of life, and fashion makeovers (Mr. Gudnason practices âSacred Dandyismâ; Mrs. Gudnason has a fashion brand; and several Japanese Guides actively promote their physical self-transformation as an aspect of Being Royal through the NEW LIFE online magazine). Initiates are also encouraged to realize their cosmic significance as part of En-sof  (""The Divine Light"") in spreading Light, combating Darkness, and helping to usher in the future of balance, peace and harmony (Shambhala). 

MMS social organization includes Founder Gudni, whose Sacred Dandy style and extraordinary (and extraterrestrial) biographical claims might be thought of as close to Weberian charismatic authority; Hideto Nakagome and Dave Lanyonâall âThird Order Ipsissimusesâ with specialized regional and theological roles; the âCouncil of 12â women, six from the West and six from the East, who âexecute the directives of the Hierarchy of Lightâ and are deeply involved with the interworking of MMS; high-level leadership who perform various roles (Grand Oracle, secretary, accountant and producers, among others often working in pairs or groups) and provide marketing/business tips to Guides; hundreds of certified Healers and Guides who may operate their own spiritual salons; and thousands of Adepts, low-level initiates and followers who may receive counseling at MMS salons or attend workshops at the headquarters. Japanese students are overwhelmingly female and often participating in the spiritual marketplace seeking community, self-transformation, healing from specific forms of trauma, and an enlarged sense of self amidst patriarchal social expectations.

1180,Batak Traditional Religions,43,Religious Group (v6),"This entry covers practitioners of the Batak Traditional Religion, a system of practices that has been typically referred to as a traditional belief (aliran kepercayaan) by the Indonesian government as opposed to a formally recognized religion (agama). However, the Batak traditional religion has gone through various local iterations, focused on the worship of royalty as god, millenarianism, modern reforms, and a re-application of an appeal toward traditional cultural understandings.

1183,Religion at Nippur in the Ur III period,43,Religious Group (v6),"Nippur was the unrivaled religious capital during the period dominated by the kings of the IIIrd dynasty centered at Ur in nowadays southern Iraq. As the city of the supreme god Enlil it can be considered as the ""Mesopotamian Vatican"" latest since the Akkad period (c. 2350 BC). The centrality of Nippur at the border between Akkad (North) and Sumer (South) might have triggered the factor of importance of the site. During Ur III times large scale construction programs at the East-mound of the site with the temple of Enlil as well as that of Inanna underlines the importance of Nippur during this period. As Ur III period is considered as a kind of ""Sumerian renaissance"" it was important for the state ideology to venerate the Old Sumerian gods. Probably building on an ancient custom, the kings of Ur were crowned to be kings of Sumer and Akkad at Nippur. 
Reconstructed with the help of the Puzrish-Dagan (modern Drehem) texts which were excavated illegally at a site nearby Nippur, the ritual calendar can be reconstructed. Each month a festival was celebrated which was often related to a specific god as, for example, the gu4-si-su (sum.) festival of the second month (c. April/May) which was dedicated to Enlils son Ninurta who was also known as, lugal gu4-si-su (sum.), ""king of the Gusisu"". One of the most important local religious celebrations was the festival at the nearby site of Tummal (modern Dlehim) with a boat procession to the ancient cultic center of Enlils wife Ninlil. Additionally, festivals related to agriculture like  the seeding (fourth month, sum. shu-numun) were also common. Other important gods at Nippur were the healing goddess Gula/Ninisina in the local form of Nintinuga (sum. ""Lady who revives the dead""). Her temple was probably localized by excavations at the northern West-mound.",-2100,-2000,1936,1012,Bernhard Schneider,50,Andrew Danielson,2021-09-02 01:18:34.211 +0200,2023-04-24 11:46:08.917 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.00611213151801836,7.175198573055262e-10,1.1370325014011418e-15,0.001389423791564236,7.462620896655708e-26,3.86429750920324e-14,0.9924984437562336,2.166242474663453e-10,2.3166393021864857e-21
1187,Sanctuary at Tell Damiyah,43,Religious Group (v6),"Tell Damiyah, a small settlement mound overlooking the confluence of the Jordan and Zerqa rivers, is the location of a late Iron Age building (ca. 700 BCE) with evidence for various Iron Age religious practices and artefacts. Hence, it was interpreted as a sanctuary. It is difficult to ascertain which deity/deities were worshipped here due to the lack of written data or and/or for example statues of deities. There is, however, potential evidence for the cult of Asherah/Astarte. Among religious objects encountered in and around the sanctuary building are anthropomorphic ceramic statues and both zoomorphic and anthropomorphic figurines, and the building itself contained two separate altars/podia.
Exactly which Iron Age kingdom (e.g. Israel, Judah or Ammon), if any, Tell Damiyah belonged to remains ambiguous, although ceramic traditions from nearby contemporary sites such as Tell Deir 'Alla point to closer contact with the region of Ammon, rather than the areas west of the Jordan River.",-850,-700,1331,996,Diederik Halbertsma,50,Andrew Danielson,2021-09-03 11:09:05.845 +0200,2021-09-06 10:41:33.831 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.005188412669269171,1.2155400591986779e-09,0.16508300706216109,0.04839851925327213,9.416551357038515e-15,2.0731685231091188e-24,0.7531345822983762,0.01149549706927205,0.0166999804320999
1189,YÄdiya/Sam'al,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Kingdom of YÄdiya, based at the city of SamÊ¾al (modern Zincirli HÃ¶yÃ¼k), was founded sometime in the 10th century BCE. Though the cityâs history stretches back to the Early Bronze Age, it was destroyed during the Late Bronze Age and remained unoccupied until it was resettled at the foundation of the kingdom. The kingdomâs cultural practices are particularly notable for their combination of traditions otherwise known from so-called Aramean and Neo-Hittite polities. The kingdom also incorporated elements of Assyrian culture derived from interactions that began during the reign of Shalmenser III in the mid-9th century. Later, the kingdom became a vassal of Tiglath-Pileser III in the late 8th century. At the end of the same century, the kingdom was abolished incorporated into the Assyrian empire as a province.
Primary sources attest to a heterogeneous population in YÄdiya. An early inscription describes two social groups (called mÅ¡kbm and the bÊ¿rrm) in a conflict that was resolved through the efforts of the king. The distinction between these groups remains unknown. While there is evidence for speech communities utilizing Semitic (particularly SamÊ¾alian) and Indo-European languages (particularly Luwian), there is no direct evidence for these groups acknowledging ethnic or other social divisions between them. The royal family of YÄdiya, for instance, primarily composed royal inscriptions in Semitic languages and sometimes took Semitic names, but Luwian names were somewhat more common. 
The pantheon of YÄdiya may have been vast, and a broken inscription from the site makes mention of âthe thousand gods,â making it the sole Iron Age polity known to have continued the Hittite tradition of referring to their pantheon in that way. More specifically, various kings are known to have been devoted to personal deities (such as King Gabbarâs tutelary deity BaÊ¿al-á¹¢emed), but the dynastic god was Rakib-El. Based on comparative evidence from the surrounding region, this dynastic god may have been a storm-god. Other storm-gods were worshipped as well, however, chief among them Hadad whose primary cult place may have been GerÃ§in. The Katumuwa inscription further mentions a Hadad of the Vineyards and a Hadad the Host as though they are separate deities, but the precise relationship between them is unknown. The same is true for Resheph and Arq-Resheph. Apart from these, the YÄdiyans revered a mix of deities known from other Levantine and Mesopotamian sources, including the sun-god Shamash, the moon-god of Haran, and BaÊ¿al-á¸¤ammon as well as the goddesses Kubaba and Nikkurawas. It is theorized that Kubaba may have been the consort of Rakib-El, but this is not confirmed by the epigraphic evidence. 
The best understood of YÄdiyaâs rituals were devoted to the royal family. These included but were not limited to mortuary feasts performed on a semi-regular basis. These were carried out in large ceremonial plazas on the acropolis, and in the royal necropolis at GerÃ§in. In the 8th century, such rituals were extended to non-royal elites as well and carried out in household contexts. Candidates for temples have not been extensively studied, so possible temple rituals remain mysterious.",-920,-713,1333,1015,Timothy Hogue,50,Andrew Danielson,2021-09-04 20:20:29.308 +0200,2022-01-20 02:39:53.172 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.036275238805148984,0.21459055970546084,1.0681244496939568e-14,0.10269324047036164,0.0006209812612810857,0.009687924275433118,0.6344298424958899,0.0017022044112173281,8.575196493826669e-09
1190,Ancient state of Urartu,43,Religious Group (v6),"Urartu developed from a series of small chiefdoms spread out on the Armenian Plateau, and had its capital established by Sarduri I on the Eastern shores of Lake Van during the mid 9th century BCE. From what today is the modern city of Van, the royal dynasty created by Sarduri ruled until the first half of the 6th century BCE. At one point the main antagonist of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, Urartian territories stretched from Lake Sevan to the southern shore of Lake Urmia, and as far West as the sources of the Euphrates. Urartuâs core topography sets it apart from most states of the ancient Near East. Lake Van lies 1,680 m above sea level, and the mountains rise abruptly from the southern and western sides of the lake. This particular part of the Armenian Plateau is an area of intersecting mountain chains, characterised by the presence of depressions separated by highland areas. The result of this particular topography is a series of irregular pockets of land. The expansion of the Urartian state is characterised by the need to secure arable land and resources. Mostly known for their metalwork and their fortifications, Urartians had a well established religion with Haldi  at the head of the pantheon. Although most Urartian temples and inscriptions are dedicated to him, there are dozens of other gods mentioned in the texts.  Teisheba and Siuini, both wider spread in the Ancient Near East, are the most important deities after Haldi. Unfortunately, as with most archaeological datasets, our understanding of Urartu is limited. The belief system centred on Haldi is closely connected to the royal family and the elite, and we do not know to what degree it permeated the rest of the society.",-850,-580,1334,1011,Dan Socaciu,50,Andrew Danielson,2021-09-07 18:31:16.394 +0200,2022-04-21 14:26:39.549 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),4.93995393326253e-17,7.661800268954035e-23,0.958562980854085,4.2947770955800994e-14,1.597881515100229e-13,1.5069373478290376e-47,0.00030745612358461656,6.240873659938154e-25,0.04112956302212771

1196,Kâicheâ (QuichÃ©),43,Religious Group (v6),"This entry focuses on the Kâicheâ living in the town of Chichicastenango, Guatemala, around the time of 1930. The principal ethnographic authority, Bunzel (1952), indicated that at this time, Chichicastenango remained relatively isolated from intensive industrialization, European Colonialism, and Christianity. Although the arrival of European (primarily Spanish) colonists brought elements of Catholocism and political changes, the traditional Kâicheâ cultural and religious beliefs and practices remained. Consequently, Kâicheâ religious beliefs were somewhat syncretic, blending and incorporating aspects of Catholocism with traditional beliefs. Bunzel (1952:163) described that the Church and State are one in Chichicastenango, and âthe problems of the individual soul, of life and death, sin and salvation, the relationship of man to the supernatural and to his own conscience are worked out through other institutions. The Church is primarily political--a state temple in which the rules and their surrogates discharge their religious obligations to the commonwealth.â In addition to church officials, the chuchqajau serves as a religious practitioner and specializes as a professional diviner, performing ceremonies for pay. These ceremonies occur during major turning points in life, such as baptism, marriage, and death. Other events in life have ceremonial aspects as well, such as building a house, planting and harvesting, and selling land. Ceremonies typically include a feast for the officiating individual and offerings to supernatural beings (Bunzel, 1952:84). Larger, communal ceremonies occur during fiestas, which mark significant holidays and are important to religious, social, and political aspects of Kâicheâ culture. Because religion permeates all aspects of life, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with Kâicheâ society itself.",1910,1940,1343,577,Emily Pitek,1,M.

1203,Book(s) of Daniel,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The book(s) of Daniel depict a complex set of texts and traditions revolving around the figure Daniel, a Judean youth in the imperial courts following the Babylonian Exile (586 BCE). The earliest texts were composed in different languages (Aramaic, Greek, and Hebrew) and later preserved in distinct versions (Old Greek, Masoretic text, fragments from Qumran, and the Greek Theodotion). The texts also feature different genres, such as narrative court-tales set in the Babylonian, Median, and Persian imperial courts, as well as revelatory or apocalyptic visions. Based on the eight manuscript fragments discovered at Qumran and the prevalence of Danielic themes in the New Testament, it is clear that the book(s) of Daniel were widely circulated and had significant influence on early Jewish and Christian literature. Tropes such as the succession of empires and the everlasting dominion of the Most High (Dan. 2 and 7) would become central to later apocalyptic literature such as the book of Revelation, 4 Ezra, and 2 Baruch. 

Although the court tales have earlier origins likely in the Persian period, the first-person visionary accounts attributed to Daniel date to the persecutions of the Seleucid ruler Antiochus IV Epiphanes (d. 164 BCE). It was also during this time period that the Aramaic and Hebrew traditions underwent their final redaction, culminating in what now resembles the Masoretic text. In the Greek traditions, there remain three additional court-like tales that are otherwise unattested. Although certainty on the matter cannot be established, linguistic features suggest that the tales may not have been originally composed in Greek but rather Hebrew or Aramaic. Each of the three talesâBel and the Serpent, the tale of Susanna, and the Prayer of Azariah and the Hymn of the Threeârelates to the character Daniel, some in more pronounced ways than others. Like the rest of Danielic literature, the date and provenance of these expanded tales are widely debated but they likely emerged during the second century BCE or earlier.",-586,100,1349,1024,Megan Remington,50,Andrew Danielson,2021-10-04 17:19:32.734 +0200,2024-06-05 21:24:07.284 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.008025665623195464,0.10760739323748927,0.005418883722665943,0.18072973154731575,0.05188632209241155,0.5321343468549026,0.002615894275562452,0.11158124212465652,5.205218003610011e-07
1207,Female alchemy Tradition,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Female alchemy (nÃ¼dan å¥³ä¸¹) is a textual tradition of Daoist meditation and physiological exercises for women which emerged in China in the seventeenth century and developed throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.  It is part and parcel of the much older inner alchemy (neidan å§ä¸¹) tradition, which advocates the possibility to achieve immortality through the progressive refinement of the body, aided by meditation, breathing, visualization, and massage exercises. This process has the aim of reversing the normal course of life that ends with old age, decay, and death, with a rejuvenation enacted through the transformation of bodily fluids into energy. This refined energy concentrates inside the body to form an embryo of immortality that is subsequently released through the top of the head. The neidan process had been formalised (within the Daoist tradition) for an un-gendered audience of practitioners as early as the Song (960â1279) dynasty. It involved three steps, the transformation of jing ç²¾(seminal essence or essence) into qi æ°£ , the trans- formation of qi into shen ç¥  (spirit), and the transformation of shen into xuwu èç¡  (nothingness). 
Until the emergence of nÃ¼dan in the late Ming and Qing dynasties, neidan was considered a genderless practice, available to men and women alike, though there was, for social and historical reasons, much less participation by women. In the Qing dynasty, this non-gendered process was adapted and applied to a specific female audience, and nÃ¼dan was born. The first individual nÃ¼dan texts started appearing at the end of the Ming dynasty, and the first full-fledged collections appeared in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. It is still practiced in China today. 
 These scriptures were often, but not always, transmitted through spirit writing at a lay Daoism altar from a god or goddess.
Differently from neidan, nÃ¼dan adapts its theory and practice specifically to the female body. Unlike a man, a woman needs first and foremost to refine her exterior form, her bloody and impure constitution, and her sexual characteristics. This attention to her exterior form directly relates to the structure of the female cosmological and physiological body that is yin and impure in nature. Blood (xue è¡) is the central element of female physiology, and what needs to be transformed. The physical starting point for female practice is the qi cavity, a point between the breasts; through breast massage and visualisations, the blood that regularly descends from the qi cavity to the uterus, or sea of blood (xuehai è¡æµ·) in the form of menses, is sent upward in a backwards motion. in the traditional alchemical refinement triad jing-qi-shen, it stands in for the essence jing, resulting in a slightly different (female) triad, xue-qi-shen. 
Practitioners achieve the thinning and eventual disappearance of the menstrual flow, a process called Beheading of the Red Dragon (zhan chilong æ¬èµ¤é¾). When this happens, other sexual characteristics change: the breasts shrink and the body becomes more androgynous. At this point, the woman has completed the first stage of the practice, the more gendered xue to qi. Once the female bloody constitution is transformed, and the gender and external sexual differences almost eliminated, the woman, having reached a state of pre-puberty or androgynity, can progress towards the final goal of immortality in the same way as the man.",1550,2021,1352,896,Elena Valussi,51,Michael Naparstek,2021-10-07 22:51:39.412 +0200,2022-03-29 17:52:51.582 +0200,Mapping Religious Diversity in Modern Sichuan,0.004951105823797649,0.1318902333355123,1.0823037220694156e-14,0.1282989078122229,0.0016944879680787725,0.23642693507585882,0.06240332949992983,0.41678898939630904,0.01754601108827967
1210,Mende,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Mende have historically lived in Western Africa; this entry focuses on the Mende living in the vicinity of the town of Bo, Sierra Leone around the time of 1945. At this time, a section was the basic political unit and consisted of several towns and villages. A section chief held political leadership of each section, and a paramount chief led the chiefdom as a whole. Secret societies, namely the Poro and Sande, served crucial roles in transmitting social norms, rules of conduct, and performance of ritual activity. The secret societies held a close connection with certain spirits and rituals, and embodied supernatural power. The chief, although a secular figure, âacted as general patron of the more important secret societies, such as the Poro and the Sande, and was expected to sponsor the various ceremonies called for in connection with the ancestral cult and related forms of worship and propitiationâ (Little, 1951:182). Supernatural beings, in addition to ancestral spirits, included non-human spirits, and a supreme high god who created the world but is said to not have an active role in the day-to-day life of humans.

1218,Yiguan Dao/I-Kuan Tao ä¸è²«é,43,Religious Group (v6),"Yiguan Dao/I-Kuan Tao ä¸è²«éis a salvationist and syncretic religion that originated in the late 19th century in Shandong Province and soon spread throughout other provinces of China. Today it claims to have millions of followers across from Taiwan, Southeast Asia, and many other regions in the world, as well as mainland China where it cannot operate openly. The name Yiguan Dao, meaning the Consistent Way, comes from a phrase by Confucius in the Analects, 4:15, âMy way has been consistent å¾éä¸ä»¥è²«ä¹.â Yiguan Dao has demonstrated its effort to evangelize the sanjiao tradition, namely, Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism, although it is usually poised as the ultimate inheritor of the Five Teachings/Religions (the sanjiao plus Christianity and Islam). 
The origin of Yiguan Dao can be traced back to Luo Jiao, a sectarian religion created by 
Luo Qing (1442-1527) during the Ming dynasty (1368-1644), which in turn attributed its ancestry to Taiping Dao, a Daoist sect involved in the rebellion of the Yellow Turbans at the end of the Later Han dynasty (25â220). Luo Jiao later evolved into several sects, and one of them was Xiantian Dao, which was suppressed by the Qing government in the early 19th century. In the 1870âs, Xiantian Dao further split into several independent sects, one of which later developed into Yiguan Dao (originally named âmohou yizhujiaoââreligion for final salvation).
The founding of Yiguan Dao with its modern look is generally attributed to Wang Jueyi (1821-1886), who extensively reformed its teachings and rituals in the late 19th century and who is venerated as the 15th patriarch of the tradition. Under the leadership of Zhang Tianran (1889-1947), its 18th patriarch, Yiguan Dao enjoyed rapid growth during the 1930s and 1940s and spread to many provinces of the country. With the establishment of the Peopleâs Republic of China in 1949, Yiguan Dao was proscribed an illegal secret society and heretical cult and was eradicated from society as part of the antireligious campaign. At the meantime, however, it grew steadily in Taiwan for decades in spite of the persecution of the Kuomingtang government, a policy that was not abolished until 1987.
Yiguan Dao embraces an eschatological and soteriological philosophy and presents itself as the only way to salvation. The highest deity worshipped by the followers of Yiguan Dao is called Wusheng Laomu, or the Eternal Venerable Mother, and its worship hall is usually highlighted by the statue of Maitreya Buddha flanked by the statues of the monk Ji Gong and Avalokitesvara (Guan Yin). According to the eschatology and soteriology of Yiguan Dao, human history is divided into three eras: Qingyang Qi or Green Yang Era, Hongyang Qi or Red Yang Era, and Baiyang Qi or White Yang Era. While Dipankara Buddha and Gautama Buddha presided over salvation in the Green Yang Era and the Red Yang Era, respectively, Maitreya Buddha presides over the third period of salvation, the White Yang Era (from 1912 onward).
Yiguan Dao practitioners regard the initiation ceremony, called Qiu Dao (seeking the Dao), as the most important ritual, which involves the ""offering of the Three Treasures""âthe saving grace from the Eternal Venerable Mother. The initiation ceremony articulates the exclusiveness of the membership of Yiguan Dao and only through this ritual can a new member be accepted into the congregation. The members of Yiguan Dao maintain a clear self-identification and call each other Dao Qin (fellows of Dao).  
Yiguan Dao followers generally believe that the corruption of humanity and natural disasters are associated with the end of the White Yang Era, which ushers in a final salvation. Thus, they emphasize the cultivation of Dao as the opportunity for repentance and purification. This moralizing doctrine paves the way for what scholars have called the âconfucianizationâ of Yiguan Dao, as is clearly seen in its guiding principle: âRespect Heaven and Earth, hold courtesy toward deities; be patriotic to nation and faithful in engagements, cultivate morality and uphold rites; be filial to parents, honor teachers and masters, be trustworthy to friends, be in harmony with neighbors; rectify evil and approach good; be clear with five cardinal relationships and eight virtues.â In recent years, Yiguan Dao increasingly draws on Confucian notions to recruit young followers, and the Classics-Recitation Movement (Dujing Yundong) that has swept Taiwan and mainland China in recent decades is largely attributable to the campaign of Yiguan Dao.",1870,2021,1366,989,Yong Chen,45,Matthew Hamm,2021-10-19 19:07:58.911 +0200,2022-03-15 19:32:55.896 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.009457309950377465,0.012909449041868023,0.09144569774507394,0.46897421671963385,0.323390229702272,2.6212375449384795e-12,0.09382165910114428,6.892879862352928e-13,1.437736319826879e-06
1219,Chunqiu fanlu,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The text Chunqiu fanlu  is a compendium of Chinese ethical and political thought traditionally ascribed to a pivotal scholar from the Former Han dynasty (206 BCE â 9 CE), Dong Zhongshu (c. 195 to 115 BCE.). Dong Zhongshu was a leading exegete of the Gongyang Zhuan (Gongyang Commentary on the Spring and Autumn Annals), an early Han commentary of the Spring and Autumn Annals (Chunqiu ). The Chinese tradition credits him with an important role in the formation of âHan Confucianismâ as the state ideology during the reign of Emperor Wu (140 â 134 BCE). But, this view is radically challenged by contemporary scholarship. This lengthy, rich and comprehensive work consisting of 82 chapters (pian), of which 79 have survived, has been commented upon in China throughout history as one of the most authoritative texts of Chinese ruism (Confucianism.) However, in terms of its authorship, dating and even in its textual preservation, the CQFL is a rather problematic text. While there is no certain answer on the question on what parts of the CQFL can be authentically traced to Dong Zhongshu, some chapters certainly originate from different sources. Most of the recent scholars agree that the CQFL is a collection of heterogeneous material from early Han and even post-Han scholarly work assembled by an anonymous compiler. The text contains a great diversity of subject matter. Sarah Queen and John Major persuasively argued that the text is arranged according to the principles that guided its anonymous compiler. They singled out five units. The first unit, Exegetical Principlesâ, consisting of the first seventeen chapters represents the earliest and most probably authentic part of the whole compilation. These chapters interpret the principles of the Spring and Autumn Annals based on the Gongyang commentary. The âMonarchical Principlesâ (chapters 18-22) focus on the techniques for maintaining the power and authority of the ruler.  They establish a kind of naturalistic approach which seeks normativity in the realm of nature. The third group, âRegulatory Principlesâ (chapters 23 to 28) addresses the regulations the ruler should observe after receiving the Mandate of Heaven. The âEthical Principlesâ (chapters 29 to 42) group discusses the fundamental virtues and ideas esteemed by ruist scholars, such as humaneness ren ä», righteousness yiç¾©, wisdom zhi æº, virtue de å¾·, the rectification of names zheng ming æ­£å, and filial piety xiaoå­. The âYin-Yang Principlesâ group focuses on the cosmology of yin-yang and the four seasons in relation to the rulerâs emotions, actions, and policies. âFive-Phase Principlesâ chapters develop the art of rulership based on Five Phase wu xing cosmology. âRitual Principlesâ group, constituted of twelve thematically linked chapters, describes various aspects of ritual obligations and sacrifice from the perspective of the Gongyang commentary on the Spring and Autumn. The âHeavenly Principlesâ (chapters 77 to 82) contain some rather corrupted chapters grouped around the idea of Heaven as the source of political and moral principles. They correlate the way of Heaven with the physical cultivation and governing the country.

1224,Duren jing,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Duren jing åº¦äººç¶, the Scripture on Salvation, is an abbreviation for the longest text in Daoist scriptures: Lingbao wuliang duren shangpin miaojing éå¯¶ç¡éåº¦äººä¸åå¦ç¶, the Wonderous Scripture of the Upper Chapters of the Numinous Treasure on Limitless Salvation. The text consists of sixty-one chapters divided by its function from saving the country to individual affairs. What we see nowadays is an expansion of the original one-chapter version text, Taishang Dongxuan Lingbao Yuanshi wuliang duren shangpin miaojing å¤ªä¸æ´çéå¯¶åå§ç¡éåº¦äººä¸åå¦ç¶ (P. 2606), collected in Dunhuang Library Cave. This Dunhuang version of Duren jing is now considered as the earliest form of Duren jing in 4th-5th century. The title points out that first, the function of this text focus on salvation; second,  the text was instructed by the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Commencement (Yuanshi tianzun åå§å¤©å°); and third, this text is miraculous and empowered by supernatural forces, thus become a wonderous scripture.
The structure throughout the text is identical. Each chapter starts with an introduction of the secret revelation and marvelous efficacy by reciting the text; then, there is the original scripture repeatedly shows up in the middle of every chapter; finally, the third part is the Innumerable Sound of the Secret Language of the Great Brahman [Energies] of the Heavens (Zhutian zhong dafan yinyu wuliang yin è«¸å¤©ä¸­å¤§æ¢µé±èªç¡éé³), a heavenly hidden language incomprehensible unless translated to the profane sound of human beings. 
The original text appeared first around 400 CE, after that, many Daoist priests commented, explained the secret knowledge revealed in the text. During the reign of Emperor Huizong of the Song (r. 1100-1125), the Daoist master Lin Lingsu æéç´ of Divine Empyrean school (Shenxiao ç¥é) led the program of enlarging the original one-chapter Duren jing to sixty-one chapters. However, neither the one-chapter nor sixty-one chapters version was the ancient text when it first appeared in the late 4th to early 5th century. 
Research on the Scripture on Salvation was an active project in Daoist Studies because, in the first place, it is the longest text among all the other Daoist scriptures, what contents in it is rich, as the description on Daoist cosmology, pantheon, rituals, etc. Besides, the text reflects strong influence by Buddhist salvation thought, the style of Buddhist sÅ«tra, and the Sanskrit language. It provides a large number of resources for the study of Buddho-Daoist interaction. In the end, the usage of Duren jing in various Lingbao ritual performances would be great materials for examining the social-religious activities of medieval to modern Daoism.",400,500,1372,969,Shuwei Hsieh,51,Michael Naparstek,2021-10-22 16:31:08.902 +0200,2022-01-27 13:46:41.689 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),3.316881536943926e-17,5.4045886345156354e-15,0.6225028119251657,1.4741171111356136e-13,0.01556147200402104,1.272199263746822e-36,6.700899927942843e-05,4.327867530590679e-24,0.3618687070713809
1227,Polytheistic Pre-Islamic South Arabia,43,Religious Group (v6),"Although the Bronze Age in ancient South Arabia (modern-day Yemen) is still poorly understood, there is a wealth of archaeological and epigraphic data for reconstructing the regionâs history from the beginning of the first millennium BCE onward. While epigraphs in the Ancient South Arabian script may date as early as the 11th century BCE, texts useful to reconstructing South Arabian history and religion only truly begin to emerge from the 8th century BCE onward. These epigraphs attest to a plurality of peoples and city-states who worshipped a variety of gods. Most important among these are the four kingdoms, Saba, MaÊ¿Ä«n, Qataban, and á¸¤aá¸ramawt, the former three which occupied the western highlands of Yemen while the latter was concentrated further east along Wadi á¸¤aá¸ramawt. Each of these kingdoms had its own language (Sabaic, Minaic, Qatabanic, á¸¤aá¸ramitic) and religion, which consisted in worship of the common high god Ê¿Athtar in addition to a kingdomâs own patron deity (Almaqah for Saba, Wadd for MaÊ¿Ä«n, Ê¿Amm for Qataban, and Sin for á¸¤aá¸ramawt) and a national pantheon of lesser gods. 
	The influence of South Arabian religion was not restricted to modern-day Yemen. As early as 700 BCE, Sabaic epigraphs, gods, and religious architecture appear in northeast Africa. This eventually disappears in the second half of the first millennium BCE, a time during which other South Arabian kingdoms notably began to expand. á¸¤aá¸ramawt then ventured eastward into modern-day Oman, where it founded a trading port at modern Khor Rori south of Salalah in the Dhofar. In the western South Arabian highlands, a new kingdom called á¸¤imyar emerged. Over the next centuries, these á¸¤imyarites would gradually increase their influence until they finally conquered all of South Arabia in the late third/early fourth century CE. Under their hegemony, state-sponsored polytheism continued until at least 360 CE, to which the latest known polytheistic text dates. Following this, South Arabia adopted a new monotheistic religion, resulting in the polytheistic gods disappearing from the epigraphic record.",-800,360,1376,1010,Jason Weimar,50,Andrew Danielson,2021-10-25 23:23:33.389 +0200,2021-12-10 02:05:54.348 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.011349976669134924,0.14607748975625426,0.05067502163535543,0.10377108792059483,0.0024400010463228113,3.052605647983091e-13,0.4866923560053159,0.07430425739343353,0.12468980957328304
1229,Three Self Patriotic Movement (TSPM),43,Religious Group (v6),"The Three Self Patriotic Movement (TSPM) is a politically oriented ""patriotic religious association"" that was established in the early 1950s by a group of diverse but prominent Protestants. The movement's name stems from its core principles of ""self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation."" Strictly speaking, the movement is not a church, but rather a collection of Protestant churches that are affiliated with the movement and who register with the state through the TSPM. The organization aims to represent Protestant believers in China and engage with the Chinese state on their behalf. To that end, TSPM maintains committees at not only the national level, but also the provincial, municipal, and county/district levels. The TSPM works in partnership with the China Christian Council, whose remit is to deal with doctrinal and pastoral issues, and, together, they are referred to as the ""Two Committees"" (lianghui ä¸¤ä¼).
 
This entry understands the TSPM through the lens of several, TSPM-affiliated churches in the city of Huanghaicheng, a pseudonym for a city of approximately 2 million people on China's eastern seaboard. The research informing this entry is Mark McLeister's extensive ethnographic work in Huanghaicheng, which has been continuing since 2009. Because of this detailed focus, there may be slight variations between the answers to the questions presented here and other TSPM-affiliated churches in different parts of China.

TSPM-affiliated churches are distinguished by their belief in a threefold yet single God (made up of God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit), who is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent, who created the world, and who is purely good. As well, members of TSPM-affiliated churches believe in an immortal soul that can be rewarded in Heaven or punished in Hell after death and that Jesus Christ is the messiah who will return at the end of the world to save the faithful and create a âNew Heaven and New Earthâ (xintianxindi æ°å¤©æ°å°).

TSPM-affiliated churches understand the universe in terms of a three-fold division between that which is âof Godâ shuling å±çµ (and Jesus and the Holy Spirit), that which is related to Satan (sadan mogui ææ¦é­é¬¼) and âevil spiritsâ (xieling éªçµ), and that which is âof the fleshâ (shu ruoti å±å¼±ä½) or âof the worldâ (shushi å±ä¸). Individual sins and sinful acts act lead to a kind of break or opening (pokou ç ´å£) in oneâs spiritual life that can allow evil spirits to influence and even dominate oneâs life. Evil spirits are also thought to be capable of possessing individuals or âplaying tricksâ (kaiwanxiao å¼ç©ç¬) on them such as by preventing keys from working in locks or hiding oneâs keys. 
 
Previous scholarship has tended to present TSPM churches as staid and austere, befitting the organization's image as a modern religion, while discussing ""household churches"" as forms of ""popular Christianity"" that deal with more sensorially and aesthetically rich forms of religious experience in a way that echoes other popular religious practices in China. However, detailed ethnographic work demonstrates that these two religious modalities are present within TSPM, with the more formal aspect featured in weekly Sunday sermons and the latter aspect more prominent in small prayer meetings among church adherents throughout the week. The latter aspect is defined in terms of lingâen çµæ©. Composed of the characters meaning âspiritâ and âgrace,â this term is the same as that used in âcharismaticâ or âPentecostalâ movements. However, its adherents understand it as referring to distinct forms of practices unaffiliated with those movements. In brief, lingâen refers to being filled with (or moved by) the Holy Spirit as a result of prayer. It is defined in sensorial and aesthetic terms and is associated with feelings of joy and peace that can easily move a person to tears. The gifts given by the Holy Spirit can also include the ability to exorcize demons, heal the sick, utter prophetic words, and speak in tongues. Although not possessed uniformly by church leaders, lingâen qualities are an important measure of authority within TSPM-affiliated congregations. The atmosphere of the prayer meetings that are the frequent site of lingâen experiences form a strong contrast to the staid atmosphere of Sunday worship services and may be considered a more personal and sensorially rich form of worship than the âpublic faceâ of TSPM-affiliated churches presented in Sunday services. Nevertheless, participants emphasize that such prayer meetings are âwarmâ rather than âhotâ (renao ç­é¹), as the term renao is thought to be associated with activities that are âof the worldâ rather than âof God,â and, in some cases, even with evil spirits. 

Protestantism is one of Chinaâs fastest growing religious movements and the complex array of interactions between the leaders and participants of TSPM-affiliated churches and the state has many potential implications in Chinese society, especially in relation to issues of state-religion interaction, as well as the role of the law in state actions.",1950,2021,1132,708,Mark McLeister,6,Matthew Hamm,2021-10-29 18:46:14.645 +0200,2022-10-27 20:59:42.578 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.0003036857640932551,0.026341806773536147,1.778897188823537e-15,0.033433137816339595,0.00013187420492354575,2.2090623598624163e-12,6.549260936274293e-05,0.9113341694201208,0.02838983340941306
1231,"Shenxiao ç¥é (""Divine Empyrean"") Daoism",43,Religious Group (v6),"This entry follows the approach of the scholar, David Mozina by addressing Shenxiao Daoism from two angles: a 12th century textual lineage and a contemporary practice in Hunan that identifies with that lineage. It does so in the hope of illuminating aspects of both lineages. However, it is important to emphasize that this does not imply direct historical continuity, but simply highlights apparently similar threads within Daoismâs religious history. To further clarify these two angles, each comment is contextualized with a note regarding time period and three different time ranges are used: 1117-1127 for the initial florescence of Shenxiao in the Song dynasty, 1990-2022 for contemporary ritual practices, and 1117-2022 for answers that pertain to both time periods or to works of the textual lineage that persisted for centuries. It should be noted that the 1990-2022 time-frame corresponds to the period of ritual revival in Hunan following the Cultural Revolution, though the practices in question may date to as early as the mid-18th century.// Shenxiao ç¥é (""Divine Empyrean"") Daoism is a branch of Daoism that emerged suddenly in the early part of the 12th century in the Northern Song dynasty during the reign of Emperor Huizong å¾½å® (1100-1118 CE). The emperor himself is often revered as the founder of Shenxiao.// Shenxiaoâs emergence was part of the rise of Thunder Rites (leifa é·æ³), Daoist rituals that began to appear in the tenth century and that relied on Thunder Deities (leishen é·ç¥) to accomplish various goals such as rain-making and exorcism. It is these Thunder Rites that are still practiced in Hunan province.// A key feature of the Shenxiao cosmology is that, although it envisions a bureaucratic cosmos similar to other Daoist lineages, it places great emphasis on the oaths that deities make with one another and with human ritualists. This emphasis on cooperation as opposed to simply bureaucratic hierarchy suggests a greater sense of the subjective agency of both deities and humans than other branches of Daoism. This emphasis extends to the practice of Thunder Rites wherein Shenxiao practitioners make oaths with Thunder Deities and cultivate the primordial qi of their âspiritsâ (shen ç¥) through Inner Alchemy in order to establish equitable partnerships with the Thunder Deities that empower their rituals. //The court ritual master, Lin Lingsu, is credited with the innovation of synthesizing inner alchemical techniques (neidan) with the exorcistic power of Thunder Deities. In 1115, Huizong appointed the ritual master, Lin Lingsu as the court's highest-ranking Daoist. Lin Lingsu won this position by claiming that there was a 9th layer of the heavens (the Divine Empyrean) that was inhabited by deities superior to those of the other layers (which were understood as the sources of the teachings of other Daoist schools). Lin Lingsu further claimed that Huizong was the incarnation of the highest Shenxiao deity, the True King Jade Clarity, Great Emperor of Eternal Life (yuqing zhenwang changsheng dadi ç¥éçæ¸ççé·çå¤§å¸) who had taken earthly form in order to bring the Dao to all parts of the world. Lin Lingsu further claimed that a number of other court personages and intimates of Huizong were also reincarnations of Shenxiao deities and that he, Lin Lingsu, was the incarnation of a celestial officer tasked with propagating Shenxiao rituals and texts.// Although Lin Lingsu eventually fell from favour, Huizong created a network of Shenxiao temples (the Divine Empyrean Palace network) and declared himself True Lord of the Dao. He thus seems to have fully intended that Shenxiao become the imperial school of Daoism and a crucial part of his theocratic reign. This network was abolished after Huizongâs reign in 1127 but Shenxiao continued to flourish well into the Ming dynasty, particularly through the work of prominent theorists such as the patriarchs of the Southern School, Wang Wenqing çæå¿ (1093â1153) and Bai Yuchan ç½çè¾ (fl. 1194â1229?). While aspects of Shenxiao ritual continued to be patronized by imperial favour during the Ming, its identity as a distinct tradition both inside and outside the court had already combined with other lineage forms.

1234,Ashanti,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Ashanti are an Akan people and have historically lived in south-central Ghana. This entry focuses on the Ashanti living in Kumasi state around the time of 1900, and largely relies on information from the principal ethnographic authority Robert Rattray (1923, 1927, 1929). At this time the basic social unit was the family group (localized matrilineage); various family groups came together under the head of one particular family to form territorial divisions or clans. Additionally, each individual belonged to one of two patrilineal exogamous divisions related to the concept of notoro. Ntoro is one of the two great elements in every individual, with bogya (blood) the other. While ntoro is transmitted patrilineally, bogya is passed through the female line. The ntoro divisions inform practices such as taboo observances and ritual activity. Key features of Ashanti religion (at the time this entry focuses on) include various supernatural beings, ritual objects, practitioners, and ceremonies. The supreme high god is known as Nyame, God of the Sky, Supreme Being of the Universe. Nyame is generally viewed as far removed from the daily life of the Ashanti but delegates some powers to other beings. Additionally, lesser deities are known as abosom, and ancestral spirits are known as samanfo. Other minor spirits, powers of nature, and beings such as fairies (mmoatia) and forest monsters (sasabonsam) are present. Certain objects are of religious significance, including obosom and suman. An obosom is a non-human spiritâs resting place, a shrine, usually consisting of a brass pan or bowl containing objects. Human spirits (ancestral spirits) are believed to inhabit objects as well, namely blackened stools. These stools were anointed during ceremonies and received offerings and sacrifices. Suman is the term to describe objects such as charms, amulets, talismans, mascots, or fetishes, which are imbued with supernatural or magical powers. Specialized religious practitioners are known as okomfo (priests). These individuals experience contact with a deity, and subsequently, enter a period of training before becoming an official priest of that particular deity. A variety of rituals and ceremonies were practiced, many of which centered around the propitiation of specific deities or ancestral spirits (such as formal clan leaders or royalty). Because religion was important to nearly all aspects of life, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with society itself.",1880,1910,1382,577,Emily Pitek,1,M.

1240,Azande,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Azande are a people who have historically inhabited Central Africa, covering parts of what is now South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the Central African Republic. The Azande are composed of distinct ethnic groups united by language, culture, and political systems (Gilles, 1999). Sociopolitical organization historically centered around various kingdoms, each led by members of the noble (Avongara) clan. This entry focuses on the Yambio chiefdom (located in Yambio, South Sudan) around the time of 1905. This entry primarily utilizes information documented by Edward Evans Evans-Pritchard (the principal ethnographic authority), who conducted fieldwork in Sudan from 1926-1930. Although the Azande had come under colonial rule at this time, Evans-Pritchard (1937) documented traditional Azande customs and beliefs that had not been subject to significant English and Arabic influences. Each household held a shrine to ancestral spirits, which received offerings and prayers. Ancestor worship was largely a household matter with no associated formal priesthood. After death, human spirits would travel to caverns at the source of streams to reside with Mbori, the omnipotent but remote supreme high god. Mbori was not associated with a specific priesthood, shrines/temples, or set of rituals, but would be invoked occasionally. Mbori did not communicate directly with humans, but would instead communicate through ghosts. A belief in witchcraft played a prominent role in many aspects of life. Evans-Pritchard (1937:9) described witchcraft as a âpsychic [non-physical] emanation from witchcraft-substance which is believed to cause injury to health and property.â Witch-doctors are those who possess the specialized knowledge and supernatural ability to diagnose and counteract witchcraft. Various types of oracles were also present and played an important role in Azande life. Oracles were consulted for a variety of matters, which they addressed through specialized knowledge, techniques, and supernatural ability. Azande magico-religious beliefs and practices permeate almost all aspects of life; consequently, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with society itself.",1900,1935,1387,577,Emily Pitek,1,M.

1241,Taiping å¤ªå¹³ Movement,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Taiping Rebellion (1851-1864) was a Christian-inspired and cataclysmic millenarian uprising during the Qing dynasty that claimed the lives of between 20 to 40 million people. This entry takes a slightly broader view of the rebellion by examining the Taiping movement behind it from 1837 to 1866.// 
 
The Taiping movement can be said to have begun in 1837 when its founder, Hong Xiuquan æ´ªç§å¨ - a failed civil service examination candidate who belonged to the Hakka sub-ethnic minority in Guangdong - experienced a series of dreams in which he was taken to Heaven to meet the one true deity and emperor of China, the Heavenly Father. He was told that China had originally existed as a monotheistic utopia before Qinshi Huangdi and subsequent emperors had been seduced by Satan into worshipping heterodox traditions such as Buddhism and Daoism. The Heavenly Father further proclaimed Hong to be a ""Heavenly King"" (tianwang å¤©ç) and charging him with restoring China to its utopian state as part of the transformation of the world into a new global order of Christian nations that would be united in their worship of the Heavenly Father and subordinate to China under Hong's rulership.//
 
Understanding himself as Jesus' younger brother, Hong began preaching his new message and was driven out of his village to Thistle Mountain in Guangxi. There he became the leader of a religious group called the God Worshippers. The majority of its members were of the Hakka sub-ethnic minority. Literally meaning ""guest people"" (kejia å®¢å®¶), Hakka were Han Chinese people who had been pushed out of the north by invasion and faced frequent conflict with the earlier Han Chinese settlers of Guangdong and Guangxi, known as the Bendi æ¬å°, who resented their intrusion and pushed them to marginal lands. Hakka people formed the core of the Taiping movement and many of their practices, such as monogamy, mutual dependence, and a resistance to foot-binding, became features of the Taiping movement as a whole.// 
 
Between 1848 and 1849, Hong Xiuquan was absent from the God Worshippers. During that time, several shamans and spirit mediums, most notably Yang Xiuqing æ¥ç§æ¸, became prominent within the group and initiated practices in which Jesus and the Heavenly Father would descend into spirit mediums and perform miracles such as speaking in tongues or faith healing. Although hesitant to endorse these practices, Hong did so upon his return and Yang Xiuqing acquired a place of prominence within the group as the voice of God.// 
 
The descents of Jesus and the Heavenly Father also resulted in iconoclastic attacks by the God Worshippers on local temples and other religious sites on Thistle Mountain, which intensified tensions between the God Worshippers and Bendi militias, resulting in numerous battles. Alarmed by the God Worshippers' clashes with the Bendi, Hong's denouncement of corrupt officials, and the loyalty of the God Worshippers to a transcendent deity over the emperor, the Qing state attacked them as a rebel threat in the winter of 1850.// 
 
Shortly thereafter, at the beginning of 1851, Hong Xiuquan proclaimed the inauguration of the Heavenly Kingdom of Great Peace and Equality (Taiping Tianguo å¤ªå¹³å¤©å) and launched an all out rebellion against the Qing. The God Worshippers, now better referred to as the Taipings, invaded the central Yangzi river valley and succeeded in capturing the former imperial capital of Nanjing in 1853.//
 
Hong proclaimed Nanjing to be the ""New Jerusalem"" and from it the Taiping movement created a theocratic state that, at its height in 1856, governed 30 million people. The Taipings were organized into specialty groups of 25 families that each provided a specific service for the state. Men and women, including spouses, lived separately and all property was held in common by the state through the institution of the Sacred Treasury. A particularly notable feature was the egalitarian treatment of men and women. Hong banned practices such as prostitution, concubinage, foot-binding, and widow suicide and insisted that women have equal access to the military, government service, education, and property ownership.//
 
Plans to reform the Taiping state into an even more utopian mode were cut short when, in 1856, Hong moved against Yang Xiuqing, who had come to refer to himself as ""holy"" and Hong as merely ""eminent."" Hong's attack on Yang Xiuqing resulted in the deaths of 20,000 people, ended the practice of mediumship, and fractured the Taiping movement, turning its commanders away from utopian visions and a united campaign against the Qing toward preserving their own regional power bases.//

Despite efforts by Hong Ren'gan æ´ªä»ç, appointed prime minister by Hong Xiuquan in 1859, to reform the Taiping state according to a Protestant vision Christian material civilization, Hong increasingly reverted to the Confucian style of government that he had previously renounced. As Hong increasingly withdrew from government affairs, Qing troops besieged Nanjing, cutting off its food supply and eventually taking the city in 1864. Hong died at the same time, possibly by suicide, and the rebellion was declared put down that same year. Imperial mop-up operations continued, however, until 1866.//
 
The Taiping movement's radical utopian vision and the devasting impact of its cataclysmic uprising left behind a complex legacy for late imperial and 20th-century China, foreshadowing and, in some instances, even helping to inspire the movements and uprisings of the 20th century.",1837,1866,1388,708,P.

1243,Shengjing zhijie,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Shengjing zhijie èç¶ç´è§£ was authored by the Portuguese Jesuit Manuel Dias (junior) é½çªè«¾ (1574-1659). It was an extensive work containing 14 volumes with an additional booklet functioning as its table of contents. The first complete set was published between 1636 and 1642. Many more reprints were continuously produced throughout the late eighteenth and early twentieth centuries. It was a vital text considered as ""Holy Scripture"" or ""Sacred Classic"" by Christian communities in the absence of a Chinese Bible. Also, it was an essential source for non-Christian scholars to learn of Christian tradition and worldviews.
 
Today, these reprints are kept in libraries all over the world. This book is a translation of the Gospel readings from Mass arranged according to the liturgical calendar, accompanied with different forms of annotations and commentaries. The body of Shengjing zhijie the text itself with Gospel readings and commentaries of different forms consists of two parts: the Gospel readings are framed in a section named âjingâ (ç¶); long commentaries upon certain select verses containing exegesis and moral admonitions constitute another section named âzhenâ (ç®´). The zhen section follows the jingsection. And interlinear annotations running through the jing section keep the Gospel readings accompanied. All the Gospel readings are arranged in the order of the liturgical calendar. Such construction is displayed in advance as Shengjing zhijie also includes paratextual elements. There are in total two tables of contents: one is a list of Sundays, âShengjing zhijie zhounian zhuri zhi muluâ (èç¶ç´è§£å¨æ­²ä¸»æ¥ä¹ç®é), corresponding to the body part in volumes 1â8 ; the other lists major feast days including fixed and movable feast days in a liturgical year in âShengjing zhijie zhounian zhuri zhi muluâ (èç¶ç´è§£å¨æ­²ç»ç¦®ä¹ç®é), corresponding to volumes 9â14. Both indicate where (which folio in which volume) to locate specific Gospel readings for specific days. Besides, there is another paratextual element is the index named âzashi zhi muluâ (éäºä¹ç®é), literally meaning a table of miscellaneous matters. This is a carefully designed functional subject index displaying 144 major concepts and subject matters on Christianity that are elaborated on throughout this text.
 
Shengjing zhijie must have enjoyed a wide and thorough reception in a long time. Although no breakthrough study has yet to precisely pinpoint its readership, it is known that this text was brought up in different contexts. Moreover, at least four editions had been approved and produced in different places in China during different time periods. And, more than a dozen of copies survived until today even after the confiscation of Catholic books when Christianity was banned in the Qing dynasty. Beyond the textual history of Shengjing zhijie, an obvious textual network centering on this text also existed. For instance, because the Chinese translation of Gospel verses made available in Shengjing zhijie, a series of several Chinese liturgical texts directly took those passages, and a Chinese version of Missal and a Chinese text on meditation were among those texts. They did establish a foundation for biblical, liturgical, and practice texts in Chinese for Chinese Catholics, although none of them received authority from Rome.",1636,1900,1420,1061,Yanrong Chen,45,Matthew Hamm,2021-11-29 08:30:48.248 +0100,2022-01-22 00:18:27.995 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),9.36923629002785e-06,0.054863719710365084,1.1280957473886855e-14,0.061978555323253116,0.0012099131906980294,1.2262149043059926e-12,4.880692781060767e-06,0.7530405751284455,0.12889298671692961

At the time this entry focuses on, the Shilluk lived along the banks of the White Nile, in what is now South Sudan. Groups of several households formed hamlets, which were each led by a chief. The chiefs were directly responsible to the king, who served as head of both political and religious affairs. Shilluk kings are said to possess the spirit Nyakang, the founder of the Shilluk and first king. Three major components of Shilluk religious beliefs are Juok (the supreme high god, an otiose creator deity), Nyakang and his incarnation through kings, and ancestor worship. Throughout Shilluk terrority are 10 cenotaphs âtombsâ of Nyakang, which are regarded as the homes of Nyakang. Similar shrines to deceased kings are also present. The attendants and priests of the royal grave shrines and cenotaph shrines of Nyakang are referred to as the bareth. The bareth were responsible for maintaining the shrine, receiving sacrifices, and officiating in ceremonies. Two classes of medicine men are present, including the ajuago (the good medicine man, who works for the good of the community and cures the sick) and the jalyat (the evil medicine man, who practices black magic).

1247,Exovedate,43,Religious Group (v6),"Exovedate was the term coined for a provisional government that attempted a Catholic state in the District of Saskatchewan by Louis Riel. Similar to movements that other scholars might call NRMs (new religious movements) and other 19th century sectarian movements, the group represented a new Catholic group that had separated from communion with Rome, part of a larger movement headed by Riel over the course of a decade. The group disbanded after a few months, but their actions have had a lasting impact on Canadian history and culture.

Heavily influenced by ultramontanism and millenarianism, the group believed that Louis Riel was a prophet of God, and that the Catholic Church, namely the Roman papacy, was in decline. The belief was that God would soon show a dramatic sign, signaling the moving of the papacy so that it may be restored in Canada by the French-Canadians and the MÃ©tis. The papacy would move from Rome to Mount Royal in Montreal, Lower Canada (modern-day Quebec). Ignace Bourget, Bishop of Montreal, was thought to be the rightful pope. It was prophecized that this papacy would also become corrupt over time, at which point the papacy would move to St. Vital in Manitoba, where it would stay. 

The Exovedate sought to bring back the Mosaic Law as the foundation of its legal code, redistribute the land claimed by the Canadian government to various immigrant groups, convert all Jewish people to Christianity, and protect humanity from the evils of 'liberalism.' They believed this was all a to be done as a prelude to the Second Advent, which was prophecized by Riel to occur in 4209C.E.

Group membership was known for certain to be a few dozen people, consisting of the government officials that made up the Exovedate and a few others close to Riel. The group died out after the North-West Rebellion in 1885, with the execution of its leader, Louis Riel.",1885,1885,1393,1066,Patrick Miller,52,Lauren Griffin,2021-12-06 01:15:04.555 +0100,2021-12-16 08:13:54.781 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.001436389408412549,0.04349245456468567,2.4205253401043623e-15,0.09946488263213588,0.004850084416834748,0.6940968980955915,0.00022582137595037981,0.15643341393136986,5.557501699752987e-08
1248,Religion in the Old Assyrian Period,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Old Assyrian period refers to the earliest attested period of the city of Assur in the north of modern-day Iraq, later the cultural center of the regionally dominant Assyrian empire. In the opening centuries of the 2nd millennium, Assur was a single city-state ruled by a representative council, whose economic engine was long distance trade in tin and textiles to Anatolia (modern-day Turkey). The extreme profitability of the trade led several generations of Assyrian merchants to settle full-time in the Anatolian city of Kanesh, where they established a community referred to as the ""port"" with its own representative body to govern the local Assyrian community. 

The Old Assyrian pantheon was largely identical with that of the rest of Mesopotamia, with the exception of the chief god of the city. The city-god of Assur bore the same name as the city itself (modern scholars sometimes use ""Ashur"" for the god in order to distinguish the two, but the native writing was identical); for the Assyrians, Ashur was the chief god of the larger pantheon. The Ashur cult and its large temple environs were the center of polity life at Assur, which seems to have lacked a palace for most of the period. Second to the Ashur cult was that of the goddess Ishtar Assuritum, who also had a large temple complex at the city. Smaller temples of other important deities existed, and certainly myriad gods had shrines within the larger temple complexes. While naturally the Assyrian merchants did not have monumental temple complexes in their Anatolian host cities, the evidence makes clear that shrines to the many Assyrian gods were established at Kanesh and elsewhere, and some Assyrians served as priests in the ""port"". 

What we know of religion in the Old Assyrian period is heavily circumscribed by our evidence, which comes predominately from the massive textual and archaeological corpus left behind by the merchants at the site of ancient Kanesh, supplemented by some archaeological evidence from the hometown of Assur itself. Consequently, what is commonly called âOld Assyrian Religionâ is above-all the lived religious experience of a group of one thousand or so individuals comprised of Assyrian merchants and their networks of relations. Furthermore, the great bulk of written evidence is from a 30-year window circa 1895-1865. Therefore, even though our window into âOld Assyrian Religionâ is narrow and incomplete, it is near-unique for the ancient world in its intimacy.",-1972,-1718,1394,1070,Trey Nation,50,Andrew Danielson,2021-12-07 19:03:27.129 +0100,2022-03-03 15:25:28.769 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.003617746998626108,0.7004061519272721,5.845942984257624e-15,0.04442804627193283,7.005274443571867e-16,8.00764091972667e-14,0.2515479371540455,1.1764774045083955e-07,2.964005772362566e-13
1250,Hanbalism,43,Religious Group (v6),"Hanbalism is one of the four Sunni schools of Muslim law, and adherents to this school are often known as the Hanabila, Hanbalites, or Hanbalis.  Hanbalis are Muslim legal scholars or theologians who base their views about God and humankind on the teachings of Ahmad ibn Hanbal (d. 855 CE). Ibn Hanbal is said to have memorized tens of thousands of reports attributed to the Prophet Muhammad, called hadith. These reports, along with the texts embodying the practice of Muhammad's companions, called Sunnah, re the sources for moral, social, and devotional life. Hanbalis reject any rational, speculative interpretation of Godâs will through the Quran and the Sunnah. They interpret God's will and nature through rigid literal interpretation, and believe that Godâs will can be known with certainty.  Hanbalis won over the hearts and minds of scholars and common people alike in early periods of their formation, resulting in a social and political movement. Some Hanbalis served in high government posts and judgeships, even at times of contention with ruling authorities. The movement began and thrived in Baghdad, Iraq for well over five centuries, with some spells of adversity by Shi'i rulers, and a movement of some Hanbalis to Palestine and Syria, where the movement enjoyed two centuries of flourishing. Their popularity in the premodern reached a pinnacle during the fourteenth century, a time when the school thrived as a result of the works of Ibn Taymiyya. Though Hanbalism is a legal school that trains scholars, non-scholars may consider themselves adherents to the teachings of the legal school by subscribing to the teaching of the school or implementing them in their own lives, such as for devotion and worship.

It first came to light in the early 20th century when Solomon Schechter published two medieval manuscripts (10th and 12th c. CE) from the genizah (manuscript storeroom) of a synagogue in Cairo. After fragments of ten more manuscripts of the same work were discovered among the Dead Sea Scrolls from Khirbet Qumran, it became obvious that the document had originated among the members of that movement. Since the oldest copies from Qumran (4Q267 and 4Q266) date to the late 2nd and early 1st centuries BCE, it seems likely that the document was composed or redacted in the mid-2nd century by the larger sectarian group (possibly the Essenes) and was then brought to Qumran by the particular expression of the group that lived there. In consequence, the text displays a trajectory of editing from more universally applicable to more overtly sectarian. In terms of content, the text mainly contains religious laws, based in part on interpretations of the Jewish Torah, intended to guide the life and practice of the group's adherents. These laws are comprised of two strataâone that presents a legal vision for the nation of Israel as a whole and one that specifically regulates the practice of the sectarian community. Across these strata, the laws deal with a wide variety of matters including, inter alia, marriage and sex, ritual purity, oaths and vows, Sabbath observance, food taboos, theft, interaction with Gentiles, and communal organization. The document also frames these laws with significant portions of text devoted to justifying the legitimacy of the laws and exhorting the sect's current members to live by them. According to the text, the laws were divinely revealed to the sectâs founders several centuries after the Babylonian invasion of Judah (early 6th c. BCE) through the instrumentality of a founding teacher. The text presents the laws as true interpretations of the Torah of Moses and encourages members of the movement to take an oath of return to this Torah. As adherents to these laws, the text styles the communityâs members as a unique group of faithful ones who hold fast to Godâs covenant during the âEpoch of Wickedness,â a temporary period characterized by societal corruption under the influence of a supernatural figure known as Belial. The text contains promises of reward to those who persevere in the way of life presented in the laws as well as warnings of destruction for those who depart from it. The Damascus Document thus provides an important window into the history of the Dead Sea Scrolls sectarian community, the community's vision of religious law, and its members' understanding of their own epoch in light of the eschaton.",-200,50,1399,1038,Bryan Elliff,50,Andrew Danielson,2021-12-13 21:00:48.659 +0100,2022-01-10 22:36:08.116 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),9.11315659324162e-06,0.05336418610160255,2.5452345880385565e-14,0.03691585946603757,0.002207763941813775,1.1313490641321862e-12,4.5301144133456815e-06,0.7324584917963212,0.17504005542206172
1255,Julian Romance,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The anonymous Christian Syriac work chronicling the life of Emperor Julian (d. 363 CE), known as Julian the Apostate for his attempt to revive traditional Roman religious practices in the final years of the Constantinian Dynasty. The Julian Romance is the apogee of a Late Antique tradition of Christian works antagonistic to Emperor Julian such as the Hymns against Julian of Ephrem Syrus and Orations 4 and 5 of Gregory of Nazianzus. While its extant recensions date back to at least the sixth century CE, the work potentially incorporates sources near contemporary to Julianâs reign. The text is likely an original Syriac composition and survives most extensively in ms. London, British Library Add. 14641 and ms. Paris, BibliothÃ¨que Nationale Syr. 378. An early Arabic translation also survives in ms. Arabic 516 at St. Catherineâs Monastery in Mt. Sinai, Egypt. The genre of the work remains a matter of debate among scholars. Nineteenth-century German orientalist Theodor NÃ¶ldeke was the first western academic to publish a study of its extant manuscripts and to render its title as roman. Scholars in the later twentieth century such as M. van Esbroeck and J. H. Drijvers, however, have defined it as a work of hagiography and religious propaganda respectively. Itself a composite text and consisting of three main sections, the work covers: the ascension and apostasy of Julian; his persecution of the Christians, especially of Eusebius, the bishop of Rome; his eastern campaigns against Shapur II; his the divinely incurred and miraculous death; and the ascension of Jovian and his restoration of the Christian Empire. Although apocryphal, the Julian Romance was the most popular and influential account of the life of Emperor Julian in semitic literatures throughout Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages. Scholars such as G.âJ.ââReinink have demonstrated the influence of the work on Syriac apocalyptic texts, especially the Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius. Accounts of the life of Julian drawn from the Julian Romance also appear in a number of Arabic universal chronicles including al-á¹¬abarÄ«, Agapius of Hieropolis, al-MasÊ¿Å«dÄ«, and Ibn al-AthÄ«r.",361,599,1401,1071,Glenn Maur,49,Ian Randall,2021-12-15 21:27:10.742 +0100,2021-12-17 04:12:55.890 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),2.249101068027536e-18,3.898891569807098e-15,0.07065080408464973,1.3063101332037121e-13,0.02248348118316252,1.1927899964705756e-35,6.386307295552202e-08,3.4890083491595236e-23,0.9068656508689803
1257,Ammonite Religion,43,Religious Group (v6),"Centered on the region around the modern city of Amman, Jordan, the tribally organized, agropastoralist society of the Ammonites (literally, âthe sons of Ammonâ) flourished during the Iron Age II (ca. 1000â500 BCE), and especially in the latter half of this period. Like other aspects of its culture, Ammonite religion shares much in common with the other cultures of the ancient Levant (Judah, Israel, Aram, Phoenicia, Philistia, Moab, and Edom). These shared traits include a state god, a variety of other gods and goddesses, a special place for the ancestors, public and private cultic areas, and indicators of adaptations from regional peers and from the major political powers of the day located in Mesopotamia and Egypt. While Ammonite religion shares much with the surrounding cultures, there are also unique features. One distinguishing feature of Ammonite religion is the state/dynastic god Milkom, whose name is probably an epithet for the god Ê¾El, and who appears to be represented in a tradition of stone sculptures that have been found in the vicinity of Amman. Also unique is the probable temple to the moon-god at Rujm al-Kursi, which most likely reflects a local tradition of lunar worship influenced by the iconography of the Mesopotamian moon-god SÃ®n.",-1000,-500,1403,994,Craig Tyson,50,Andrew Danielson,2021-12-16 17:45:03.199 +0100,2022-06-02 18:51:12.511 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.017762803716126294,0.07219623808270485,0.01893299392990298,0.07811984702402927,0.0023767435866267235,0.0022433662303682485,0.8079376435302634,0.0004303357782408666,2.8121737189530783e-08
1258,Religion in Judah,43,Religious Group (v6),"The population of ancient Judah had, as their supreme god, YHWH. The earliest texts did not use vowels. When later texts did adopt vowels, the name of YHWH was considered too holy to vocalize. Through a misunderstanding of scribal practices, modern scholars misread the name as Yehowah/Jehovah. Today, scholarlly reconstruction normalizes the name as Yahweh, though there remains some minor doubt as to its accuracy.
The people of Judah (Judahites, sometimes referred to as Judeans/Judaeans, though this better represents the region under later Roman occupation) were predominantly highland people who derived from the broader ethnic category of ""Canaanites."" Pastoralism and highland agriculture (vineyards, olive orchards, some grains, etc.) were the norm. Being situated in the southern Levant (eastern Mediterranean seaboard), Judah occupied an ancient crossroads and often felt the pull and dominance of Egypt and/or Mesopotamia. Judah, as a polity, only gained a firm identity during a period when those greater political centres had directed their attention elsewhere. The highlands also afforded Judah some measure of protection as well as isolation.
The official religion of Judah was centred on the capital city, Jerusalem, where there was the official temple dedicated to YHWH. As with other ancient temples, this temple was also a site for royal administration, and may have supported the local scribal culture. Priests oversaw offerings, including both animal and vegetative offerings, and prophets proclaimed their messages publicly. Festivals were most likely linked originally to the agricultural calendar, though later they became attached to the cultural memory of certain events in Judah's past. 
Two of the thorniest issues in evaluating Judah's religion are Judah's identity vis-Ã -vis Israel and the actual religion of Judahites obscured by the ancient sources, namely the Hebrew Bible/Tanakh/Old Testament (hereafter HB).
The HB presents Judah as having been part of Israel from its founding ancestors. Our earliest non-biblical sources, however, display two neighbouring kingdoms, Judah and Israel, with Israel being the more powerful. Modern historians often doubt that Judah had been part of Israel, but instead had later assumed Israel's identity when the kingdom of Israel was destroyed by the Assyrians in the late 8th century BCE. The HB comes to us via Judah, though undoubtedly some of the material originated in Israel. Therefore, it is difficult to disentangle Judah from Israel in reconstruction. Many of the religious aspects assigned to ""all Israel"" (including Judah in the HB) may not have been practiced in Judah. According to the HB, Israel and Judah had formed what is often called the ""United Monarchy"" under Saul, David, and then Solomon, with ""all Israel (including Judah)"" being ruled from Jerusalem. After Solomon (c. 930 BCE), the HB says that the kingdom of (all) Israel, split into two kingdoms: Israel in the north, with capitals that changed with dynastic changes, and Judah in the south, centred at Jerusalem and housing the dynastic line of David. Therefore, studies of Judah as a distinct identity is sometimes given dates as early as mid-11th century BCE if including the HB's ""all Israel,"" or beginning from c. 930 BCE, when the HB says Judah and Israel split. Others, relying primarily on archaeology, will begin meaningful discussion in the 9th century BCE when we begin to see more non-biblical attestations to the kingdom of Judah.
The second issue, regarding sanctioned religion, is also obscured by the HB. The texts we have are the largest source of information about Judah, but they were curated and edited heavily by scribes of a certain theological position. There is evidence of difference beneath the surface. Archaeology, even more so, shows a wide variety of religious practices either not described in the HB or condemned therein. Various other gods received worship (Asherah, Baal, El, et al.), and other religious officials presided over other religious shrines (not in Jerusalem). Household religion and ancestor worship also seem to have proliferated in Judah. Of these aspects, however, we have less information and scholarship is usually suggestive rather than certain.",-1000,-586,1404,1072,Kurtis Peters,50,Andrew Danielson,2021-12-17 20:33:59.334 +0100,2021-12-17 20:44:44.945 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.0002618609136303898,0.03189365209446643,1.732149858669247e-15,0.05554997081605098,0.00011077359398633273,1.9394952360020717e-12,6.0588649512767555e-05,0.8749638973456445,0.03715925658476715
1259,"The LuWang School, the School of Lu Xiangshan and Wang Yangming",43,Religious Group (v6),"Lu-Wang Confucianism is a part of Neo-Confucianism from the Song dynasty (970-1279) and onward. The main protagonists were Lu Xiangshan é¸è±¡å±± (1139-1192) and Wang Yangming çé½æ (1472-1529).

However, they are not isolated from each other. They manifested rather two different approaches in an ongoing debate. Zhu Xi and Lu Xiangshan met and were corresponding on philosophical matters. Lu Xiangshan is accused by the Cheng-Zhu Confucians for being a Chan Buddhist. It is his emphasis on spontaneity, criticism of textual and ritual rigidity, which lays behind such criticism. Such discrepancy is however found within the Buddhist tradition as well and even within Chan Buddhism. Therefore, this criticism does not give justice to the Lu-Wang current.

1260,Qiá¹£á¹£at DhÄ« al-Qarnayn,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Arabic Alexander Romance attributed to AbÅ« âAbd al-Malik, which recounts the life and conquests of Alexander the Great. The work casts Alexanderâs campaigns as a proselytizing mission bestowed upon him by God to bring monotheism to the most distant regions of the world. Part of the Western-Arabic Alexander tradition, the text is closely related to the Aljamiado Rrekontamiento del rrey AliÅ¡andre and the anonymous á¸¤adÄ«th DhÄ« al-Qarnayn edited by Garcia Gomez. As noted by Faustina Doufikar-Aerts, its extant isnads date much of  the text to the latter-half of the 9th century, although Z. David Zuwiyya demonstrates further additions up to the mid-13th century. The text is also noteworthy for its potential use of a lost work of al-MasÊ¿Å«dÄ«, the thirty-volume chronicle AkhbÄr al-zamÄn, as a major source. It has been edited and translated by Zuwiyya based on two extant manuscripts in Madrid: Real Academia de la Historia ColecciÃ³n Gayangos 61 and Biblioteca Nacional de Madrid ms. 5378. The narrative of the text is the result of centuries of syncretism between the broader Alexander Romance tradition and Islamic exegetical literature and Christo-Islamic universal chronicles. The phenomenon is attributable to Alexanderâs early identification with the figure of DhÅ« al-Qarnayn in Qurâan 18:83-102, which is itself a retelling of the seventh-century Syriac Christian Alexander Legend as edited by E.A. Wallis Budge. The Qiá¹£á¹£at DhÄ« al-Qarnayn presents Alexander as a fully Islamicized prophet guided by the angel ZayÄqÄ«l (a corruption of Raphael) and whose campaigns are explicitly religious, instituting forced conversions to monotheism for all conquered peoples. After capturing the Persian empire of Darius III and the Indian kingdom of Porus, Alexander then moves on to mythological realms, converting people such as the TÄrish who have the faces of dogs and the bodies of geese, etc. He eventually enters the Land of Darkness in search of the Fountain of Immortality but is forced to turn back. Upon his return, he does not die in Babylon, but in the Holy City of Jerusalem. Throughout the text, Alexander is also continually identified with Muhammad by presaging his accomplishments. For example, Alexander rides the flying al-BurÄq, circles the KaÊ¿bah, and smashes the idols found within the temples of those he converts.",850,1250,1407,1071,Glenn Maur,49,Ian Randall,2021-12-21 00:30:12.332 +0100,2021-12-21 03:27:25.715 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),2.675649100611963e-18,4.6383267833077186e-15,0.03776154822169232,1.0711533290091026e-13,0.024259796598693904,1.3460139589656974e-35,6.992432746001197e-08,4.150708113657171e-23,0.9379785852551745
1263,Judean/Yehudite Colony at Elephantine (Persian period),43,Religious Group (v6),"Standard encyclopedic introductions to a religious community generally begin with information on the groupâs name, origins, and overview of its membership. This information, however, is highly debated among experts. Therefore, the current introduction begins with the points on which scholars are broadly in agreement. During the fifth century BCE, on the island of Elephantine (an island in the Nile near Aswan) officials of the Persian Empire oversaw a multi-ethnic /multi-cultural colony which centered on a military garrison patrolling the empireâs southern border. In the early twentieth century several Aramaic papyri connected to this garrison were presented to British amateur archeologists by local Egyptians. Since then, many more documentsâpapyri and ostracaâ have been brought to light either on antiquities markets or through excavation. Most of these documents belong to the fifth century BCE (Van der Toorn, Becoming Diaspora Jews, 3-8).  
	The Aramaic documents from Elephantine which include official and personal correspondence, administrative documents, contracts, as well as a copy of the Words of Ahiqar and an Aramaic version of the Behistun inscription, shed light on a diverse community. Within the documents one can find individuals and groups described by a wide-range of gentilic adjectives as well as references to Egyptian, Persian, and Syro-Canaanite deities. Among those personal and group descriptors are a number of references to âyhwdynâ (singular âyhwdyâ). Some documents refer to the âyhwdy garrison in Elephantine.â Among the deities, there are references to âYHW,â the deity of the biblical Israel and Judah described in the Hebrew Bible (there spelled YHWH). The documents even indicate that there was a temple to YHW. How to properly describe this group of yhwdyn who worship YHW at his temple is a matter of debate.
	With respect to the groupâs name, scholars translate yhwdyn variously as Judean, Yehudites, and Jews reflecting their positions on the groupâs origins, ethnicity in the ancient world, and when Judaism (or, more broadly, religion) emerges as a category. Concerning the question of the groupâs origins, the documents from Elephantine only hint at potential answers. Scholars generally recognize that the group came from the Levant, but precisely where they came from in that region, when they came to upper Egypt, and under what conditions is a matter of conjecture. 
Regarding the religion of the community at Elephantine, scholars again are left to piece together the evidence. One highly fragmentary document, TAD A4.1 or ""the Passover Papyrus"" seems to be concerned with timing around a festival. Some scholars have connected this to the Feast of Unleavened Bread and Passover despite neither being mentioned in the papyrus. Other documents reference a temple to YHW and sacrifices offered there. Some of these documents are addressed to the governor of Yehud. This raises questions about the centralization of the cult of YHWH in Jerusalem. Documents from Elephantine also reveal that the priests of the Egyptian god Khnum with the support of a certain Persian official destroyed the temple to YHW calling into question the harmony between various groups at Elephantine.",-500,-399,1411,1025,Julianna Smith,50,Andrew Danielson,2022-01-05 17:22:03.800 +0100,2022-01-14 22:06:57.042 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.004204964530140623,0.13372107194975696,0.11661968612783709,0.23351301408446318,0.1366380938483409,0.1790439019100455,0.1551107045941575,0.04114802032939342,5.426258648843889e-07
1265,Mozi å¢¨å­,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Ancient Chinese philosophical text that would become foundational to the philosophical current known as Mohism. Attributed to a thinker known as Mozi, the text's importance lies in constituting the first extant challenge to ideas later labeled as Confucian. ___ 

The Mozi å¢¨å­, also known as Mojing å¢¨ç¶, is an text traditionally attributed to thinker Mo Di å¢¨ç¿. Very little is known about Mo Di. The biography recorded in the Records of the Historian å²è¨ one of the briefest, and presents Mo Di as a man from the state of Song å® (conquered by the Qin ç§¦ state in 286), who was skilled at defensive works and practicing frugality. He is said to have lived during or after Confuciusâs times, in the 5th century BCE. The Yi wen zhi èæå¿, the oldest extant catalogue collected in the Hanshu æ¼¢æ¸ describes the Mozi as a book of 71 chapters ç¯. The current edition is however of 53 chapters; Johnston (The Mozi, page xxvii) suggests that 18 chapters were thus lost between the Han and the Song dynasties (i.e., between the second and thirteenth century CE), but Bi Yuan ç¢æ² (1730-1797 CE) annotated in the Lushi chunqiu åæ°æ¥ç§ that âthe book of Mozi originally had 71 chapters, today 16 have been lostâ (Lushi chunqiu jishi åæ°æ¥ç§éé 15.363, 2009 Zhonghua shoji edition), suggesting that perhaps two more chapters were lost after the 18th century. Of these 18 chapters, there is only a record of 8 titles. No content has survived. 
___
Little has emerged from ancient manuscripts that may help recovering missing steps in the formation of this text. Decades after the recovery of Xinyang ä¿¡é½ bamboo manuscripts (1957), Li Xueqin æå­¸å¤ identified a handful of them as the Mozi. This content is not part of the received Mozi that we see today; it was recorded in an edition circulating until the Tang dynasty, but was later lost. According to preliminary introductions, the Anda University collection of manuscripts also include some passages related to the text of the Mozi (Huang Dekuan 2017). This confirms previous suggestions that at least part of the Mozi was composed during the Warring States era (453-221BCE), with then additional textual material that became part of what today is the Mozi. None of the authors of this textâs sections can be identified. 
___
As noted in the scholarship (Johnston; Goldin), a peculiar feature of the textual history of the Mozi is its âdisappearanceâ from the Qin dynasty (221 BCE - 206 BCE) onwards, until the text become widely available as part of the Daoist Canon éè, published in 1447. The records of commentaries are scarce, and the commentaries themselves have not been preserved (Johnston xxvii). Following this publication, it took another few centuries for Chinese scholars to rediscover this work. The major studies of the Mozi date to the Qing dynasty (1644-1911 CE). The current shape of the text is due to the work of the above mentioned Bi Yuan. Because of the secluded life of the text, it is very likely that the remaining 53 chapters correspond quite closely to what was catalogued during the Han dynasties. ___ The current structure of the Mozi is divided as follows: A) the Core Chapters, 1 to 7; B) the eleven âcoreâ doctrines, from 8 to 39. each doctrine at some point included three sections (labeled as ä¸ä¸­ä¸). Of these 33 chapters, 25 only survive. C) the canons, ç¶ (two chapters); D) the explanations ç¶èªª, 2 chapters; E) three chapters, two referred as âthe choosingâ chapters, å, and one named Geng Zhu èæ±; F) four chapters in the form of dialogues, 47 to 50; G) the remaining chapters, eleven in total. 
___
In terms of its content, the Mozi represents a set of ideas that are often considered to be a response to values later identified as Confucian. A central theme in the Mozi is that of âimpartial caringâ å¼æ, that is to say, the idea that individuals should care for each other impartially, regardless of oneâs relationship to one another. Human are those who promote what is good for the world, not for oneself or oneâs family (ä»äººä¹äºèï¼å¿åæ±èå¤©ä¸ä¹å©ï¼å¼æä¸). The figure of Mozi was attributed frugality perhaps in light of the textâs arguments against lavish uses of music (éæ¨ in 3 chapters, of which one has been preserved), and in favor to moderating funeral rituals (ç¯è¬, originally 3 chapters of which one has been preserved) and expenditure (ç¯ç¨, two of three chapters have been preserved). The arguments are developed from the same logic: if something does not benefit all society alike, then the way in which it is conducted must be changed. For example, extravagant funerals should be encouraged if they enriched the poor, gave abundance, corrected perils and governed chaos (åè¬ä¹åªå¯¦å¯ä»¥å¯è²§ç¾å¯¡ï¼å®å±æ²»äºä¹ï¼æ­¤ä»ä¹ï¼ç¾©ä¹). Because this is not the case, those in charge should discourage it. ___ Heaven is also a critical topic, which is addressed primarily in three chapters titled âHeavenâs Willâ å¤©å¿. Heaven is also referenced in other sections of this work, but one ought not haste to find a unified conception of Heaven or other subjects, given that the âMoziâ almost certainly is the result of multiple hands. As it happens with many other ancient texts, it is more appropriate to talk of common themes shared across multiple chapters. On the basis of these three chapters, Heaven can be summarized as an entity that desires what is right over what is wrong (âHeaven desires righteousness and abominates unrighteousness, å¤©æ¬²ç¾©èæ¡ä¸ç¾©â Leggeâs translation); it sets standard for ruling and proper government, and cares for all people, å¤©ä¹æå¤©ä¸ä¹ç¾å§. Because Heaven is unavoidable, one ought to take what it desires and wants as model, and act accordingly: âThe will of Heaven to me is like the compasses to the wheelwright and the square to the carpenter, ææå¤©å¿ï¼è­¬è¥è¼ªäººä¹æè¦ï¼å äººä¹æç©.â Because of this, Kirkland has defined the Moziâs view of Heaven completely subservient to the socio-political philosophy of this text.",-400,200,467,586,Maddalena Poli,45,Matthew Hamm,2022-01-07 22:02:22.097 +0100,2022-02-24 22:47:54.417 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.007736467060730134,2.501710993092246e-09,7.997298426979881e-14,0.40895546269154975,6.222092714424368e-15,4.229270975321284e-13,0.5799028747170348,0.0034051802948213855,1.2733643871210492e-08
1268,Monotheistic Pre-Islamic South Arabia,43,Religious Group (v6),"This entry treats the state religion of Pre-Islamic South Arabia from the second half of the fourth century CE until the region was absorbed by the Sassanians in the seventh century CE. During this time, the ruling Himyarites not only expanded South Arabia to its largest territorial extent ever, spanning from modern Yemen to lower Iraq and perhaps even to Palestine (Robin, 2012), but they also adopted a new form of monotheism, which was heavily influenced by but distinct from Judaism. This Judaizing Himyarite Monotheism worshipped a monotheistic deity called either Raá¸¥mÄnÄn âThe Mercifulâ or Ê¾IlÄn âGod.â While details about this religion are sparse, Philostorgius provides some hints concerning its character. He records that Constantius II sent an expedition to Himyarites (called âHomeritaeâ) in South Arabia in what would be the time of ThaÊ¾rÄn YuhanÊ¿im (324-375 CE). He describes the Himyarites as âof the Israelitish familyâ but notes that they sacrificed to various native gods. There were also Jews in the royal court, who are said to unsuccessfully oppose the Christian embassy, as Philostorgius alleges that the Himyaritic king converted to Christianity and built three churches. Yet during that time, public state sponsorship of polytheism did not cease in the epigraphic record. It is not until the reign of ThaÊ¾rÄnâs son, MalkÄ«karib YuhaÊ¾min (375-400 CE; Robin, 2012), that worship in the monumental display texts was almost unilaterally directed to Raá¸¥mÄnÄn, with mentions of the old gods becoming almost extinct (yet, they still persist in the less public stick inscriptions; Stein, 2009). Explicitly Jewish inscriptions also begin appearing in fourth century CE; albeit, the exact relationship of South Arabian Judaism with other outside contemporary Jewish groups remains unclear (Hughes, 2020a). There is further uncertainty as to whether their God, who is twice explicitly called âThe Lord of the Jews,â was originally identified via syncretism with Raá¸¥mÄnÄn or if he was thought to be a separate distinct but still monotheistic divinity, who existed alongside Raá¸¥mÄnÄn (Gajda, 2017). Regardless of this potential distinction, the name Raá¸¥mÄnÄn does eventually get absorbed into local Christian and Jewish vocabulary as a moniker for âGod.â During the fifth century CE, the state continues to sponsor Himyarite Judaizing Monotheism all-the-while tensions between Christians and Jews begin to rise. The Martyrdom of Azqir (Conti-Rossini, 1910) records a priest named Azqir being arrested for proselytizing. He was then brought to trial before the Himyarite king (who is not said to be Jewish) and the Jews on his court. The text ends with Azqirâs martyrdom, with the narrator noting that thirty eight Christians had received a similar fate during that kingâs reign. In the sixth century CE, state sponsorship of Judaizing Himyarite Monotheism disappears as the Ethiopian Aksumites gradually gained control of South Arabia and installed a Christian king, MaÊ¿dÄ«karib YaÊ¿fur, on the South Arabian throne in 519 CE. Around this time, the Christians began to persecute the Jews. When MaÊ¿dÄ«karib dies a few years later in 522 CE, a Jewish prince named YÅ«suf AsÊ¾ar YathÊ¾ar (Arabic DhÅ« NuwÄs) began a series of military campaigns seeking to expel the Aksumites and to burn their churches (Robin, 2012). This culminated in the slaying of the Martyrs of NajrÄn in 523 CE, wherein the Jewish King YÅ«suf gained control of NajrÄn by artifice and then systematically kills the Christians. This event gave justification for the Aksumite King Kaleb to invade South Arabia, during which he killed YÅ«suf and violently seeks vengeance on the Jews. South Arabia thereafter would remain under Christian control until it was eventually acquired by the Sassanians.",360,570,1414,1010,Jason Weimar,50,Andrew Danielson,2022-01-17 21:41:21.189 +0100,2022-01-27 04:22:56.354 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.011046377398280011,0.04599491582091255,3.103166203607657e-25,1.9852175352846226e-12,0.06916763552224502,0.7852119933930872,0.08857907786307435,4.157143020913777e-13,4.667096972955533e-17
1270,The Zhuangzi,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"This entry explores the creation and development of the Zhuangzi (Chuang tzu), purportedly written by Zhuang Zhou èå¨ (d. 286 BCE) and his followers. The text of the Zhuangzi is traditionally divided into 33 chapters--Inner, Outer, and Miscellaneous chapters--but these divisions were created after the author's death by commentators and editors. The Inner chapters are purportedly the closest to Zhuang Zhouâs original meaning. While it is unclear if a religious group or network existed during the early formation and transmission of the text, later centuries of transmitted materials and excavation sites reveal that the Zhuangzi was collected and read by elites and was considered a valuable Daoist text. Although later scholars of religion made a clear differentiation between âphilosophical Daoismâ and âreligious Daoism,â of which the Zhuangzi belongs in the former, those are not historically accurate terms. In fact, the Zhuangzi was added to the Daoist canon (Daozang) relatively early (some say as early as the 5th century) but the earliest extant version (thus far) dates to 1445 CE and the Ming dynasty.

The central tenant of the text is the concept of the Dao as a Way or path to live oneâs life in accordance with nature but unlike texts such as the Daodejing, the Zhuangzi is more interested in ways to pursue happiness and an ease or flow of the mind that can be realized by an individual with a change in perspective. Categorizations made by humans in an effort to understand the world around them are always inaccurate and prevent us from truly understanding the Dao.  Tapping into the Dao is the only way to truly live oneâs life to the fullest. Making use of parables, stories, and humorous dialogues, the author(s) of the Zhuangzi expand the concept of the Dao posed by the Daodejing and how it relates to the internal world of the mind. Society and governments are not important to the Zhuangzi. The text focuses on  the ideal human as a perfect Sage, but such a learned individual is not exactly the same Sage as we find in the Daodejing. According to the Zhuangzi, the Sage is happy and freely wanders the cosmos and is integrated to it in mysterious ways. Breath (qi æ°£) and essence (jing ç²¾) are basic elements to life, and understanding how we can link such life-essentials to the Dao is part of the focus of the text. Such mystical elements found in the Zhuangzi set the stage for later Daoist schools to expand longevity practices and other forms of meditation. Cultivating oneâs breath and essence can cause spiritual and physical transformations to a person, and in later periods of history, Daoist longevity techniques focused on how to transform oneself into an immortal using some of the concepts introduced in the Zhuangzi (e.g. fasting the mind xinzhai å¿é½ and sitting in oblivion zuowang åå¿).",-551,1911,1417,1053,Anna-Alexandra Fodde-Reguer,45,Matthew Hamm,2022-01-18 20:59:02.089 +0100,2022-02-11 18:10:45.843 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),4.8762617236309105e-30,3.898204080095608e-27,0.9999567381527061,1.6749222276999172e-13,2.453885999592729e-15,3.473856061977968e-49,1.1203701495620161e-17,5.348749215475272e-38,4.326184712371742e-05

1283,Butonese Muslims,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Butonese, also known as Orang Butung or Orang Butuni is a collective term that embraces diverse ethnic groups (such as the Tukang Besi, Muna* and Wolio) from the island of Buton and neighboring islands that constitute the Indonesian province of Sulawesi Tenggara (Southeast Sulawesi). The Butonese population (estimated at ~ 236,000) mostly professes Islam. Historically seafarers, the Butonese migrated from Johor (today's Malaysia) to the island of Buton and have subsequently immigrated to the Moluccas, the center of Indonesia's spice production in search of better economic opportunities. 

The Butonese Sultanate (founded ~ 1540), with the conversion of the Sixth Raja of Buton to Islam, occupied a strategic position in the coastal trade between Java and Makassar, on one hand and the Moluccas, on the other. The sovereignty of the Butonese Sultanate was challenged around the seventeenth century due to the power struggle between Makassar and Ternate for the control of the spice trade. By 1613, Butonese Sultan La Elangi liaised with the Dutch East India Company (VOC) to free the Sultanate from the power struggle between Makassar and Ternate. But by 1669, the Sultanate was placed under the suzerainty of Pax Neerlandica by principle although in practice, the principality was independent until 1906. Subsequent to Indonesian independence (1945) and the transfer of power to the Indonesian Republic (1949), Buton continued to remain a Sultanate until 1960 when the principality was merged into the Indonesian republic.

* Muna do not consider themselves Butonese although the  Muna-Buton languages belong to the Celebic sub-group of Austronesian family to which Wolio belongs. So, it would be safe to generalize that Butonese refers to the inhabitants of the former Sultanate of Buton (prior to 1960).",1500,2002,1431,1084,Vivek Neelakantan,37,William Noseworthy,2022-02-01 11:26:19.185 +0100,2022-02-13 06:55:49.373 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),4.350785144316424e-28,4.0600599139469906e-26,0.5536203316236576,1.381736499574302e-13,0.013197562356197725,2.975033544423757e-36,3.645343319432648e-06,4.560751595089378e-34,0.43317846067668697
1284,Religion of Phoenicia,43,Religious Group (v6),"The religion of Phoenicia was based on a polytheistic system. The high degree of political fragmentation of the city kingdoms of the Levantine coast implied that each center had its own pantheon, characterized by specific features although structurally similar to that adopted in other cities. Usually, at the top of this system was placed a couple of divinities, considered as polyadic entities, owners of the territory. Thus, for example, Byblos was dominated by the Baalat Gubal (literally the ""Lady of Byblos"") and by a local Baal (identified by the Greeks with Adonis), while in Sidon, at the head of the city religion, Eshmun and Astarte were worshipped; further south, in the rich and powerful Tyre, Astarte was once again conceived as protector of the city, this time next to Melqart, the ""King of the city"" (as the name openly states, from milk, ""king"", + qrt, ""city""). The polyadic gods were then joined, obviously, by other figures, each one - such as Baal Shamim, the ""Lord of the heavens"", Baal Hammon, ""the lord of the house chapel (?)"", or Shadrafa, the "" healing geniusâ- playing a specific role within the particular conception of the world, of nature and society, developed by the Phoenician culture. A direct and privileged relationship existed between the gods and the various city kings: the latter, who must and must still be ""just and righteous"", were emanations of divine power itself and had the task of maintaining balance between gods and men, ensuring the continuous communication between the divine and human spheres. Not surprisingly, one of the main roles of the sovereigns, who sometimes defined themselves as ""priests"", was to celebrate the divinities erecting or restoring their houses (the temples). Unfortunately, almost nothing of Phoenician mythology has been preserved so far. However, the Greek and Latin literary sources allow us to know some episodes and some themes, even if reread in the perspective of the sources themselves. Fundamental, for example, is the contribution of Philo of Byblos who wrote in Greek a ""Phoenician history"" in the second century AD (collecting the legacy of a mythical Phoenician priest, Sanchuniaton), some fragments of which have come to us thanks to the mediation of Bishop Eusebius of Caesarea (4th century AD). Philo's work includes tales of cosmogony and theogony, in which it is possible to recognize elements of original Phoenician beliefs.",-1200,-330,1432,1095,Giuseppe Garbati,50,Andrew Danielson,2022-02-01 12:00:20.894 +0100,2022-04-11 19:47:04.801 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.0055507461811349,0.10734676539765649,0.2754256705823241,0.1760134653774335,0.060145727188389134,0.014363646232405004,0.23945891144533674,0.03007631180375235,0.09161875579156785

1289,Buginese Muslims,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Buginese are a politically and ethnically dominant seafaring group from the Indonesian province of South Sulawesi (Sulawesi Selatan), occupying much of the province's fertile lowlands. The Buginese language (Basa Ugi) belongs to the South Sulawesi language group and is related to Makassarese, Toraja and Mandarese. 

Historians are uncertain about the early origins of the Buginese ( 2500 BC- 300 BC). Between 300 BC-1200 AD, the Buginese were organized into a number of small chiefdoms and practised wet-rice cultivation, especially in the upper Cenrana valley (~1200 AD). 

Around the thirteenth century, the Buginese experienced rapid social change due to the incorporation of South Sulawesi into the wider trading network of the Indian Ocean, that extended between China and India  via the Majapahit Empire centered on Eastern Java. The thirteenth century and the associated growth of trade in the Indian Ocean, witnessed a growth in wet rice cultivation, population increase, loosely unified kingdoms and growing social stratification of Buginese society (Caldwell 2004). The transvestite Buginese priests or Bissu guarded the kingdom's regalia and have pre-Islamic roots. 

The earliest Buginese kingdom of Luwu (before the sixteenth century) in the Gulf of Bone controlled the iron ore trade. The Luwu Bugis united disparate tribes of interior South Sulawesi. But by the sixteenth century, the Luwu kingdom was eclipsed by Makassar. The sixteenth century witnessed the rise of Makassar as an entrepot port and the union of the Makassar kingdom of Gowa with the kingdom of Tallo. 

The Luwu Bugis converted to Islam (~1605). The Buginese conversion to Islam is related to the legend of the Three Datok (Mak. Datoâ Tallua and Bug. Datoâ Tellue), who were the preachers or muballigh. By 1607, the principalities of Gowa and Tallo embraced Islam. Islamization in South Sulawesi had to come to terms with Adat or traditonal customs. The Three Datok tried to draw parallels between the Shariah (legal practice derived from the teachings of the Al Quran) and Adat or customary law such that Islam was not seen as an alien belief system (Sila 2015). Islamic preachers, especially Datok Pattimang interpreted the notion of ""tauhid"" or absolute oneness of God,not in strictly Islamic terms, but invoked the Buginese  notion of Dewata Seuwae (One God). Furthermore the preachers contended that the Buginese and the Makassarese people had descended from one God "" Parewa Sara"" and that the two groups were representatives of One God on Earth (Sila 2015). 

~ 1605, the Dutch made inroads into South Sulawesi to secure monopoly over the flourishing spice trade of Makassar. They secured the support of the Bone Bugis to defeat Gowa in a civil war (~1669). The principality of Bone, in effect, was recognized as the overlord of South Sulawesi in exchange for Dutch monopoly of the spice trade. The eighteenth century in Makassar coincided with a period of political instability in South Sulawesi, particularly rival claims to the throne of Gowa (~ 1739) and an uprising by a commoner in 1776 that drew on Buginese resentment against the Dutch presence in Makassar.

 During the brief British takeover of the Indies archipelago (1811-15), the Bone palace was ransacked. Uneasy relations between the Buginese rulers and the Dutch continued throughout the nineteenth century. In 1905, the Sultan of Bone was exiled to Batavia (now known as Jakarta).

The Dutch indirect rule in South Sulawesi (1905-41) made use of adat and the traditional hierarchies, extant in Buginese society. Subsequent to the conclusion of the Pacific War (1942-45), the notorious Dutch captain Raymond Westerling directed a brutal repression of nationalist forces in South Sulawesi. 

During the 1950s, the Sulawesi countryside was ravaged by the quasi-Islamic rebellion led by Kahar Muzakkar, a disaffected Buginese army officer. The rebels made attempts to wipe out non-Islamic elements of Buginese culture, resulting in the burning of traditional houses and manuscripts. The Indonesian central government reacted to the political unrest in the undivided province of Sulawesi by splitting the province into North and South Sulawesi in 1957. But the move did not take into account ethnic diversity of the province (Booth 2011). 

In the early 1960s, the two provinces of Sulawesi were split into four, an arrangement that continued until 1998. Fear of secessionist movements in the Outer Islands, fearful of Javanese political domination was the reason President Abdul Rehman Wahid (1999-2001) disembarked on a policy of administrative decentralization. In 2004, the province of West Sulawesi or Sulawesi Barat, with the Mandarese, comprising the single largest majority, was carved out of the parent province of South Sulawesi. In this case, the role of former President B.J. Habibie (1998-99) who hailed from Sulawesi was no less important. But attempts to carve out a new province in the northeastern part of South Sulawesi could not materialise due to ethnic and religious tensions that could not be reconciled between the Buginese and the Torajans. Nevertheless, administrative decentralization since 1999 has seen increased assertion of Buginese identity in the province of South Sulawesi.",1500,2004,1437,1084,Vivek Neelakantan,37,William Noseworthy,2022-02-04 18:48:44.117 +0100,2022-02-13 19:58:24.609 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),2.1961557133683227e-14,1.4316170244078891e-12,0.9861168784869027,5.7758065564577924e-08,0.013176173022952728,6.618223716881867e-13,0.0007068906592327649,5.561533600596401e-22,7.07308889855279e-11
1290,4QInstruction,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"4Q/1QInstruction, or Musar le-Mevin, is the most extensively preserved wisdom text among the Dead Sea Scrolls. The text was found in multiple copies in Cave 4 (4Q415, 4Q416, 4Q417, 4Q418, 4Q418a, 4Q423), while an additional copy was found in Cave 1 (1Q26). The earliest copy (4Q417) is dated to the end of the Hasmonean period (70 BCE), while the latest (4Q423) is dated to mid-late Herodian (10-50 CE). The provenance and the writing time of the text are controversial, and much depend on the attributed social context. 
The composition, which occasionally reflects apocalyptic perceptions, covers a wide range of topics, offering its readers insights and advice on different aspects of their lives. The material can be roughly divided into two categories: cosmological and practical wisdom. The cosmological parts address the relationship of the reader with God, his cast lot, and his assigned place in the cosmic structure of the universe. The practical wisdom offers advice on the social behaviour of its addressee, family and women, agriculture, or financial matters. 
4QInstruction resembles linguistically, literary, and ideologically with other wisdom works. The composition, undoubtedly, inspired and relies on the scriptural wisdom works as the Book of Proverbs, with whom it often shares rhetorical structure. Other textual similarities can be identified between the composition and the Wisdom of Ben Sira, including priestly references, for example, or some financial matters. Additionally, scholars emphasize the affinity between 4QInstruction to Hellenistic wisdom texts as the Wisdom of Solomon or the writings of Philo, point towards similar expressions or similar understanding of the creation and men. 
The possible context of the composition in is directly related to the question regarding the affinity between 4QInstruction, the movement associated with the Qumran site (the Yahad) and its writings. There is some resemblance between 4QInstruction and the core writings of the movement, especially the Community rule and the Hodayot (1QS and 1QH respectively, and their parallels in Cave 4). The affinity includes joint worldview and concepts, as well as the revelation of wisdom according to oneâs status. Yet, it is ambiguous whether the text was written outside the community (for example, among priestly circles which rejected the authority of the temple) and adopted by the Yahad, or composed among the movement at some stage. The objectors for the latter point towards occasionally different halakhic perspectives between 4QInstruction and the Community Rule, or the sections which concerns women and family matters, topics which are absent from the Community Rule.",-100,50,1440,1091,Anna Shirav,50,Andrew Danielson,2022-02-06 17:02:52.579 +0100,2022-03-09 22:08:34.401 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),3.4727002627072753e-15,1.956302897943286e-12,1.5674251401729343e-13,0.7655081142182736,0.04050700018861602,0.19397003045172262,1.4532634970170611e-05,3.73011986180429e-12,3.225005709733199e-07

1294,The Autobiography of Adad-guppi,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Adad-guppi inscription is a rare pseudo-autobiography of a woman with political and religious power in the ancient Near East. Two copies of the inscription were discovered: one poorly preserved text excavated in 1907 at the archaeological site of Harran in southern Turkey, and another more complete copy discovered in 1958 as a part of the pavement steps to the Great Mosque at Harran. The text, written in Neo-Babylonian Cuneiform dating to the sixth century BCE, celebrates Adad-guppiâs devotion to the gods, her service to the royal court and her role as queen mother to her son Nabonidus, the last king of Babylon. The monument stood in the ancient city of Harran in the moon god temple, named the Ehulhul, which was newly rebuilt by Nabonidus following its destruction during the Assyrian and Babylonian battle for power in the late seventh century BCE. Although the inscription is written as a first-person account by Adad-guppi, the emphasis on Nabonidusâs right to kingship and the details of Adad-guppiâs funeral support that it was created by someone in the royal court following Adad-guppiâs death. The nature of the text is apologetic, seeking to justify the kingship of Adad-guppiâs son Nabonidus, who ascended the throne despite his questionable royal lineage. According to the inscription, Adad-guppi was born in the reign of Assyrian king Ashurbanipal (649 BCE) and died during reign of her son Nabonidus (547 BCE). This would make her an astonishing 104 years old, which is about 70 years past life expectancy during that time. While it is not mentioned in this text, other sources tell us that her husband was a court servant named Nabu-balastu-iqi. Following the fall of Assyria in 609 BCE, Adad-guppi served in the Neo-Babylonian royal court and became queen mother during the tumultuous reign of Nabonidus. The inscription claims that Adad-guppi and Nabonidus respectfully served Babylonian kings Nabopolassar, Nebuchadnezzar, and Neriglissar and made gracious funerary offerings upon each of their deaths because their close kin did not perform the necessary rites for their deceased relatives. The assertion that those with familial claim to the throne did not exhibit piety to gods or kings is in contrast to Nabonidusâs devoutness that eventually rewarded him with kingship over Babylonâs irreverent legitimate heirs. Historical sources describe how Nabonidus usurped the throne from Babylonian king Labashi-Marduk in 556 BCE just a month into his reign. By his and his motherâs own accounts, Nabonidus was not the next in line for the throne, but the inscription stresses that their devotion to the moon god landed him the position. Nabonidus was strong enough to maintain his position as ruler for sixteen years until 539 BCE when the Achaemined Persians annexed the Babylonian empire. The text notably favors the moon god Sin calling him the âking of the gods,â which is a departure from the exultation of Marduk, the traditional Babylonian chief deity. While the heartland of the Babylonian empire was in lower Mesopotamia, this text focuses on the city of Harran and the Ehulhul. It was not unlike Nabonidus to favor a city outside of Babylon as he did by living in Tayma, an oasis in the Saudi Arabian desert, for ten years during his reign. The destruction of Harran is framed as a consequence of Sin leaving the city in anger, and Adad-guppiâs pious pleading was meant to entice Sin back to his residence in Harran just as it had secured her sonâs kingship. Because of Adad-guppiâs devotion to the gods, she did not suffer any ailments that often come with old age, stating that her eyesight, limbs, appetite, and heart remained in good condition, and she witnessed four generations of her descendants. Of these descendants, we are aware of Nabonidus, king of Babylon, and his two children, Belshazzar the crown prince, and Ennigaldi, high priestess of the moon god at the temple in Ur. The destruction of the Ehulhul in Harran appears to be of great concern to Adad-guppi, and the gods respond to her pleas with a promise that the temple and city would be restored to a beauty surpassing their former glory. Nabonidus apparently carried out reconstruction but did not complete the temple until after Adad-guppiâs death. The fragmentary end of the inscription details Adad-guppiâs burial and funerary procession, including particulars about being interred with garments and a mantel of gold and precious stones. Nabonidus slaughtered a sheep as part of the ritual for his deceased mother and ordered people throughout the empire to mourn for seven days, casting their clothes and cutting their hair. Mourners were then anointed with fine perfume and rejoiced as they went back to their homes. The inscription asserts that piety in oneâs worldly life will keep oneâs descendants safe and privileged, and Adad-guppi and her son Nabonidus were exemplars of such piety.",-649,-539,1445,1104,Heidi Fessler,50,Andrew Danielson,2022-02-11 18:15:55.959 +0100,2022-02-11 19:26:08.258 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.02160465177582635,8.48546515391548e-10,2.1596972963390404e-14,0.03809232458883584,4.524451999350992e-15,7.611016643128659e-14,0.9400663140638363,0.0002367077302523146,9.926005509119005e-10
1295,Donatism,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Donatist controversy erupted in early fourth century Roman North Africa in the immediate aftermath of the Diocletianic persecution. The North African church was heir to the legacy of Cyprian of Carthage, whose belief that lapsed bishops were ineligible to administer the sacraments would prove crucial in the events that followed. During the Diocletianic persecution, a rift developed within the church over the status of bishops who had complied with the authorities and handed over their copies of the scriptures to be burned, an action referred to as traditio. In response to rumors that the newly-elected bishop of Carthage, a man named Caecilian, had been ordained by such a compromised bishop, a group of seventy bishops from Numidia denounced his ordination as illegitimate and elevated an alternate candidate to the Carthaginian bishopric. After their candidate was rejected at the councils of Rome in 313 and Arles in 314, the dissidents, called âDonatistsâ by their opponents after their charismatic second leader, Donatus of Carthage, were considered schismatic by the wider Christian church. 
Within Roman North Africa proper (modern Tunisia, Algeria, and parts of Morocco), congregations that viewed Donatus and his successors as the legitimate bishops of Carthage seem to have been in the majority throughout the fourth century. Failed repressions by the emperors Constantine in the 320s and Constans in the late 340s created a strong self-narrative among the dissidents that theirs was the church that âsuffers persecution but does not cause itâ (Gesta Carth. 3.258), though violent reprisals by Donatist partisans known as Circumcellions against their Caecilianist opponents tarnished this claim. Despite their âschismaticâ status, Donatist writers were influential among Latin Christian communities outside of North Africa, especially the maverick theologian Tyconius, whose Book of Rules and Commentary on the Apocalypse dominated Western Christian approaches to exegesis and eschatology well into the Carolingian era. The Cyprianic position that schismatic bishops could not legitimately perform the sacraments led many Donatist communities to require converts from the rival church to be baptized upon entry, a practice their opponents decried as ârebaptism.â
The decline of the dissident communion can be attributed in large part to the efforts of Caecilianist opponents like Augustine of Hippo and Aurelius of Carthage in the 390s, which culminated in an imperial edict in 405 imposing heavy fines and confiscation of property on adherents. This edict was reified in 411 at an imperially-sanctioned debate between the two sides at Carthage. Donatism survived as a coherent movement long after the Vandal invasion of the 430s, and was last referenced as a contemporary phenomenon in the letters of Pope Gregory I late in the sixth century.",311,600,1446,1074,Jesse Hoover,49,Ian Randall,2022-02-14 07:59:24.131 +0100,2022-02-15 00:26:37.804 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),1.1566194132941026e-05,0.04823464501674903,3.915087721829286e-15,0.024314994566629777,0.0013906369500424481,1.4102099349190877e-12,5.062293243305799e-06,0.834907626491756,0.09113546848603242
1297,Chen-Wei Texts,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Chen-Wei Texts, or âprophetic-apocryphalâ texts, refer to a corpus of religious texts that prevailed from the 1st to the 7th century C.E. in China. Chen è®, meaning subtle and fulfilled prophecy, represents a number of esoteric writings, such as the Hetu æ²³åâDiagram of the Yellow Riverâ and Luoshu æ´æ¸ âScript of the Luo River.â An early appearance of Hetu in pre-Qin texts was described as precious stone or treasurable book. No later than the Warring States period, Hetu and Luoshu were commonly regarded as auspicious portents, in the form of texts with diagrams recording divination and prophecy. It was also believed that these texts sprang up from the Yellow and Luo rivers carried by mysterious animals, such as the dragon and turtle. Earlier Han (202 B.C.E.-8 C.E.) practitioners of magic methods produced a number of esoteric texts named after the Hetu and Luoshu. These texts circulated among the practitioners of magic methods (fangshiæ¹å£«) and proto-Daoists from the Third to the First centuries B.C.E. These writings covered and mixed with knowledges and concepts of astrology, geography, divination, traditional medicine, ancient myths, and witchcraft, etc. In the Earlier Han, these writings were sometimes used as prognostication books for political interests, especially when imperial legitimation and Heavenâs Mandate were under examination. A high tide of political manipulation of the chen texts took place during Wang Mangâs çè½usurpation of the Earlier Han and the establishment of Later Han (25-220), between 8 to 25 C.E. Once Emperor Guangwu åæ­¦, the founding emperor of the Later Han, secured his throne, he instructed a few learned Confucian scholars to collate and purify the chen texts, ensuring that the prophetic messages were in favor of the Han imperial house. The Earlier Han Confucian teachings that had a mystical nature, such as the teachings of the Gongyangå¬ç¾ School, the Chunqiu fanluæ¥ç§ç¹é² by Dong Zhongshu, the Jingshi Yizhuan äº¬æ°æå³, Interpretation Associated with the Book of Change by Jing Fangäº¬æ¿, and Liu Xinâs åæ­theories on Hongfan wuxingæ´ªç¯äºè¡, were also merged into âprophetic interpretationâ (jingchen ç¶è®) associated with the Confucian canons. In the last year of Emperor Guangwuâs reign (56 C.E.), an endorsed version of the prophetic texts was publicly announced. According to Zhang Hengå¼µè¡¡(78-139), a renowned astronomer and writer, the endorsed version, under the corpus title of tuchenåè® âDiagram and Prophecyâ, consisted of eighty one titles or volumes, including both Hetu and Luoshu and the prophetic interpretations associating with the âseven canons.â âFive Canonsâ and âSix Canonsâ were common terms used to refer to the Confucian classics in the Earlier and Later Han. âSeven Canonsâ occurs a few times in the Later Han materials, sometimes together with prophetic interpretations. The âSevenâ indicates the Book of Changeæ, the Book of Historyæ¸, the Book of Odesè©©, the Book of Ritesç¦®, the Book of Musicæ¨, the Annalsæ¥ç§, and the Book of Filial Pietyå­ç¶ (and in some occasions the Analects è«èª). Encouraged by the Later Han authorities, the learning of prophetic texts played a predominantly ideological role during the Later Han and the Three Kingdoms periods. These prophetic interpretations, which prophesized the Han Houseâs legitimacy to receive Heavenâs Mandate, were soon accepted as a secret canon among the Later Han Confucian schools. The two branches of the texts, the esoteric writings named after the Hetu and Luoshu, and the prophetic interpretations associated with the seven canons, although derived from different religious or intellectual origins, soon began to interact each other and mutually penetrated. In the late period of the Later Han and then after, these texts were taken as a corpus often referred to as Chen-Wei, literally âprophecy and weftâ (a counterpart to Jingç¶, âclassicâ or warp), a corpus of prophetic-apocryphal texts. Naming the prophetic interpretation texts after wei was a late Later Han phenomenon yet prevalent in post-Han eras.
As a double-edged sword routinely used in socio-political struggles, established powers became vigilant about the prophecies and offensive ideas in the Chen-Wei texts. A series of bans against the Chen-Wei texts were issued repeatedly by authorities one after another from the Third to Seventh centuries. Most parts of the Chen-Wei texts are no longer extant. From the middle of 14th to early 21st century, scholars have been working hard to collect and collate fragments of Chen-Wei and have been trying to put them together, wishing to restore the Han dynasty Chen-Wei texts to a certain extent. Dozens of Chen-Wei collections have been published. The most influential collection should be the Jushu Isho Shusei éä¿®ç·¯æ¸éæ [Revised Edition of the Collection of the Apocryphal Texts] (1971â1991) by Yasui KÃ´zan and Nakamura ShÃ´hachi. However, textual problems remain in all existing collections: wrong collection, missing- collection, wrong title, wrong or missing source, suspicious source, wrong dating, etc. Currently, a research project led by Lu Zongli is in progress, attempting to re-collect and re-collate the Chen-Wei texts, which should be more accurate, more reliable and more authentic.",56,907,1272,1103,Zongli Lu,45,Matthew Hamm,2022-02-17 13:36:57.021 +0100,2022-02-23 02:52:27.504 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.9828485163323117,0.010635241075986528,2.2119659584889833e-14,1.5408519192028117e-09,7.851198070203227e-05,0.006437729068480677,1.6334756218849286e-12,1.1534417236121077e-14,2.760704501189614e-30

The church in Viriatino was closed in 1933, and by the 1950s, many of the traditional religious beliefs and practices had been abandoned. Aspects of religion that were retained through state-sponsored secularization mainly related to marriage or treatment of the dead. Certain important holidays were also celebrated, but with fewer and less strict religious practices than had been observed in the past (such as required prayers or fasting).

1304,Peyote Religion (Peyotism) and the Native American Church,43,Religious Group (v6),"Peyotism has ancient roots in the indigenous cultures of Mesoamerica. Archeologists have found Peyote buttons in human stone dwellings carbon dated as early as 5000 BCE. This entry, however, focuses on the migration of the Peyote tradition to the US in the late nineteenth century and provides an account of the founding and development of the Native American Church (NAC) during the long twentieth century. This group's central ethos and religious practices revolve around traditional Peyote ceremonies and religion, but nearly every group incorporates Christian beliefs and moral teachings to varying degrees of prominence.  

Quanah Parker, a Comanche war chief, is largely credited as the most significant figure in the importation of Peyotism to the US. Towards the end of the 19th century, a bull gored Parker while he was traveling to Mexico to visit relatives. He fell extremely ill and nearly died due to complications with the wound. After failed attempts to heal Parker by Anglo doctors, a Mexican Indian healer had Parker consume a tea made from boiling a green cactus called Peyote. Parker healed shortly after that. Upon recovering, he asked the healer to teach him about the sacred properties of the plant and the rituals and traditions surrounding its consumption. She happily obliged.

After learning all that he could from the healer, Parker took his experience and what he learned about the peyote tradition back to the Comanche reservation in Oklahoma. From there, the religion spread rapidly among Indians in the Western plains, and in 1918 Oklahoma Peyotists organized the Native American Church (NAC) to promote ""the Christian religion with the practice of the Peyote Sacrament."" The NAC still exists today and boasts over a quarter million members; it is most prominent among the Navajo. In 1990 Peyotism would find itself at the center of a precedent-setting case about the limits of religious freedom in Oregon v. Smith.

Today, the NAC and other American Indian groups practice the Peyote religion in various parts of the US. Two primary forms of ceremonies involve the consumption of Peyote: (1) the Half Moon ceremony; (2) and the Crossfire ceremony. The Crossfire Way--first called the Big Moon Way--incorporates more Christian elements than the older, more traditional Half Moon Way. However, both contain Christian characteristics by the end of the 20th century. The character of Peyote Religion is largely a product of its historical context and the conflicts and controversies surrounding its proliferation. The following attempts to recount significant events and figures most significantly affected its trajectory and current modern form.",1875,2022,1600,732,James Waters,5,Courtney Fitzsimmons,2022-02-21 18:30:50.964 +0100,2022-07-10 06:30:59.082 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),4.8399398396981366e-17,5.801936848697755e-15,0.9321912068049343,0.0676735560029201,8.414486199353185e-14,3.519036973818335e-36,1.617652554206279e-15,5.475263715609442e-26,0.00013523719205417128
1307,Southern Baptists,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Southern Baptist Convention is an American Protestant Evangelical Christian Tradition formed in 1845. It is currently the largest Protestant denomination in the United States with a membership of 14 million adherents. It has historically emphasized evangelism, personal salvation, the authority of the Bible as the Word of God, and the autonomy of local churches.

The Southern Baptist Convention was originally formed in Augusta, GA in an effort to defend slavery (a view which has since been vehemently and retroactively condemned by the Southern Baptist Convention). In the 1980s, conservative Southern Baptists implement the âconservative resurgenceâ (alternatively called the conservative takeover by its detractors) in which they sought to return to a more traditional understanding of Christian beliefs and practices in response to a perceived drift towards mainline/liberal thinking. This resulted in liberal and moderate Baptists disassociating themselves and forming their own associations. Throughout their history, the Southern Baptist Convention have sought converts to Christianity domestically and abroad through missionary endeavors.  In 2010, Southern Baptists voted to be alternatively referred to as âGreat Commission Baptistsâ due to their evangelistic emphasis and international presence. The most well-known Southern Baptist was Billy Graham (1918-2018) who was known for leading mass evangelism events around the world.

The Southern Baptist Convention describes itself as âa body of like-minded local churches cooperating together to reach the world with the Good News of Jesus Christâ (sbc.net). A central component of the Southern Baptist Conventionâs mission is to âproclaim and minister the Gospel because the love of Christ compels us to do so. Godâs call to us is to present the Gospel of Jesus to every person and to make disciples in every town, every city, every state, and every nation. The SBC is committed to sharing the Good News of Jesus Christ with the whole worldâ (sbc.net). 

The foundation for contemporary Southern Baptists beliefs is the depiction of the Bible as the Word of God, which is also seen as the authoritative source for Christian beliefs and practices. Southern Baptists have also constructed a summary of their beliefs in a document called âThe Baptist Faith and Messageâ, which represents a broad perspective on 18 topics dealing with theological, ethical, and cultural issues. Southern Baptist churches are not required to affirm or adopt this document, but it does represent a perspective that is widely held among Southern Baptists.

1308,Jews and Jewish-Sympathizers in South Arabia,43,Religious Group (v6),"Between 275 and 300, the South Arabian kingdom of á¸¤imyar managed to subjugate the nearby kingdoms of Sabaâ and á¸¤aá¸ramawt, and unified the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula. The language of the ancient and renowned kingdom of SabaÊ¾ was chosen as the official language of the kingdom. All inscriptions dated after the fourth century are classified as á¸¤imyarite.  In order to further culturally unify their subjects, the king of á¸¤imyar MalkÄ«karib Yuhaâmin (reigned from about 375 to 400) converted to monotheism around 380. According to the fifth-century Ecclesiastical History by Philostorgius (d. ca. 439), a Christian religious mission of Theophilus the Indian (d. 364) took place in South Arabia after the kingdomâs unification. However, we do not possess any source other than Philostorgius claiming that âTheophilus persuaded the king to become Christianâ in the fourth century. Two religious communities are in South Arabia during the fourth and fifth centuries. The local Jews influenced the ruling elites, which adopted a cautious form of monotheism which could be defined as âJewish sympathizingâ. In some respects, the god invoked by the South Arabian kings and princes resembles the âHigh Godâ venerated in the Graeco-Roman world and in buffer-state regions such as the already mentioned Palmyra. HÌ£imyarâs becoming monotheistic was a more gradual process than previously thought, a conclusion supported by the religious vocabulary employed in the monumental epigraphic corpus. The á¸¤imyarite monotheistic inscriptions of the time contain three different titles to indicate a supreme monotheistic deity. The most common ones are: âln (âGod,â also spelled âlhn, âlh, or ââlhn), Bâl/Mrâ S1myn (âLord of the Heaven,â sometimes âof Earthâ is added), and Rhá¹ nn (âMercifulâ). Although these theonyms possess blurred connotations, around ten á¸¤imyarite inscriptions point to the presence of Jews in late antique South Arabia. Some inscriptions mention âthe People of Israelâ (s2âbn Ys3râl), the Jews (Hd/Hwd/Yhd) or the formula âOwner of the Sky God of Israelâ (Bâ(l) S1myn âlh Ys3r[âl]). We also possess an edict granting the construction of a Jewish cemetery. There are many Hebrew and Aramiac loanwords in these á¸¤imyarite inscriptions.

1309,Circumcellions,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Circumcellions (sometimes called Agonistici) are a subgroup of Donatists in northern Africa in the fourth and fifth centuries CE. In general, Donatists are remembered for their rigorous stance on Christian clergy's baptismal and ethical practices, particularly in the wake of persecution, in order for their ministry and sacraments to be deemed valid. Donatists, including Circumcellions were primarily active around Carthage and spread throughout the broader North African province of the Christianized Roman Empire. This group believed, in the wake of Diocletian's persecution of Christians, that those who denied Jesus's lordship or repudiated Christian scriptures by handing them over to Roman authorities had given up the ability to function as leaders within North African Christian communities.

Augustine, Optatus, and Filastrius of Brescia comment on the Circumcellions as a more radical branch of Donatist thought and practice emerging from Numidia that were characterized by their opponents as being rural hooligans, local mobs, and inciters of violence. They first appear in written record in the early fourth century in Numidia, and seemed to have been a more vocal subgroup within Donatist thought regarding the importance of changing the material circumstances of Christians. They particularly took violent action against traffickers of enslaved people and local landlords. They are often remembered (sometimes incorrectly or polemically) for seeking out martyrdom through violence, and for provoking soldiers, travelers, and courts to hasten their death -- all of which complicated late ancient Christian discussions of what types of martyrdom were acceptable. Unfortunately, much of what is known about the Circumcellions comes via the writings of those who saw them as a threat, so it is difficult to tease out what is rhetorical and what is historical reality about the group. Additionally, Circumcellions were primarily rural Donatist Christians who took aim at urban Catholic Christians, providing evidence that some Christian beliefs and practices were split along geographic and demographic lines. Because of their rural center, Circumcellions were remembered as comparable to bandits and highwaymen because of how they purportedly harassed urban travelers and soldiers across North Africa. By the seventh century, the Circumcellions' reputation spread such that their name was associated with non-North African clerics whose opponents wanted to label them as dangerous.",315,500,526,754,Chance Bonar,40,Stephen Christopher,2022-02-23 16:43:53.820 +0100,2022-03-09 03:04:20.711 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.001436389408412549,0.04349245456468567,2.4205253401043623e-15,0.09946488263213588,0.004850084416834748,0.6940968980955915,0.00022582137595037981,0.15643341393136986,5.557501699752987e-08
1311,Jehovah's Witnesses,43,Religious Group (v6),"The religious movement that would grow into the Jehovahâs Witnesses first coalesced in Pittsburgh in the 1870s around a young founder named Charles Taze Russell. Though previously disillusioned with religion, Russell was strongly influenced by Adventist ideas of Jesusâ imminent return. He began gathering friends and followers at a Bible Study and publishing a periodical called âZionâs Watch Tower and Herald of Christâs Presence.â By the 1880s, Russellâs congregations had proliferated, and he had formally founded the organization that would become the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, the guiding institution behind the Jehovahâs Witnesses. 

But the Jehovahâs Witnesses faced a prophetic challenge as a mounting number of revised dates that Russell continued to set for the apocalypse came and went without Christâs tangible return. After another apparently failed prophecy in 1914, Witnesses began to argue that Jesus had indeed returned, but had done so invisibly, beginning a heavenly rule and ushering in the âlast daysâ that will lead up to an imminent Battle of Armageddon. Soon, they believe, Jesus will purge the earth of sin and wickedness, creating a paradise. A small group of elite believers will rule over it with him, while the rest of the righteous will be reawakened to live eternally on the new earth. Nonbelievers will be punished with eternal death.

Because of their belief that the Apocalypse is imminent, Witnesses are hyper focused on proselytizing in their home communities and around the world. They do this through door-to-door outreach and by distributing literature in public places like train and subway stations. Through a tight organizational structure led by the Governing Body at a global level and elders at a congregational level, Jehovahâs Witnessâ variations in practice, belief, and biblical interpretation are kept in check. Beyond their outreach efforts, Jehovahâs Witnesses are fairly insular, maintaining strong boundaries between insiders and outsiders. They are a relatively âhigh costâ religious group in terms of the demands they place on membersâ time, energy, and autonomy. They also stand out from other Christian groups for their rejection of the trinity, as well as for their refusal to celebrate holidays, participate in politics or shows of patriotism, or receive blood transfusions. Over the last century, Jehovahâs Witnesses have often faced intense persecution around the globe.",1870,2022,1460,738,Joanna Smith,5,Courtney Fitzsimmons,2022-02-24 16:29:06.053 +0100,2022-05-02 16:47:28.348 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.00040761062357431776,0.10223792521578688,2.286853904036602e-15,0.49973705245230277,0.0007353651688266295,0.26158548394358927,0.0001482574452254223,0.13514814216367627,1.6298701611805988e-07

The brotherhood grew out of the QÄdiriyya (Xaadir) tariqa, a á¹¢Å«fÄ« movement to which Bamba was himself an adherent. Three distinctive features mark the Mourides. First, their devotion to their order's founder, Amadu Bamba, mirrors the level of veneration often reserved by Muslims for the Prophet Muhammad. Second, their adherence to the principle of hard works makes them ideally suited for agrarian life in the Senegalese countryside. Third, their commitment to principled Islamic nonviolence, even during decades of resistance to French colonial overlords, has much to do with the emergence of Senegal as a nascent West African democracy in a region often beset by civil wars. Bamba's influence cannot be overstated. Mouride Wolof believe that by serving Bamba's vicegerents they participate in the blessing (baraka) of their founder and find a path to eternal life. A suborder of the Mourides, the Baye Fall, was initiated by a close disciple of Bambaâs, Ibrahima Fall, who continued his predecessorâs emphasis on the virtue of hard work. Other principles that are important to Mourides include mild asceticism, charity toward the order, filial devotion, Arabic and Islamic education, faith in the Hereafter, communal solidarity, the repetition of  Godâs names (dhikr), and the Grand Magal, an annual pilgrimage to the holy city of Touba.",1853,2022,382,750,Tasi Perkins,43,Quinn Clark,2022-03-05 21:02:33.910 +0100,2022-05-19 18:56:40.556 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),1.0456614960982481e-05,0.36344882599711914,3.1892654065128458e-15,0.21664042906660708,9.345450361723504e-05,1.4490969794497038e-13,1.4073103741210572e-05,0.17414913408056606,0.24564362663324024
1322,Pagans under the Emperor Julian,43,Religious Group (v6),"Practitioners of traditional, indigenous, and non-Abrahamic religions and mystery cults under the Roman Empire, even during the brief reign of Julian (r. 361-363), were hardly a unified group, except in the mind of the emperor himself and his circle of intellectual elites. Although the term ""pagan"" originated as a Christian pejorative for non-Christian gentiles, it is more adequate than either ""polytheist,"" which excludes non-Abrahamic monotheists, or ""traditionalist,"" which erases groups that are relatively more recent than the familial and state cults of, for instance, Athens or Rome, i.e. Mithraists and Manichaeans. Individualsâ participation in religious practices, moreover, is not always consistent with inner convictions that are usually impossible to discern. 

Julian's religious beliefs and policies, nevertheless, attempted to integrate the rich diversity of Roman pagans into a single, artificial category in contradistinction to Christianity, which he regarded as an anti-religion, tantamount to atheism, that worshiped corpses rather than gods. Julian saw legitimate religions, Judaism included, as necessarily tied to ethnicity and geography. The ""ethnic god"" of each polis or ethnos accounted for their essential characteristics, e.g. the Romans were descended from Mars and so were warlike, while the Athenians inherited their philosophical tendencies from Athena. Julian called the Christians by the demonym ""Galileans"" in order to deny the religion's universality and restrict it to the ethnos of Jesus. As pontifex maximus and Hellenic Neoplatonist, the emperor not only treated Roman culture and religion as âfrom beginning to end, Greek;â he also placed all cults throughout the empire under his purview in a syncretic and henotheistic manner: every ethnic god was an emanation of the supreme god, which the emperor identified with the sun-god Helios. Basing his theology on the Neoplatonism of the Syrian Iamblichus of Chalcis, Julianâs Helios manifested itself in a triune hierarchy: at the top was Helios the King of All (pambasileus), which is âbeyond being,â source of all being, and equal to the Platoâs Form of the Good and the One of Plotinus; King Helios (basileus) occupies the middle rank, the father of the gods and creator of the cosmos identified with Zeus and Platoâs Demiurge; lowest is the visible Sun, the conduit of Heliosâ blessings upon the sensible cosmos. Julian and his inner circle also drew from Iamblichus the conviction that contact and spiritual union with Helios and the other gods cannot be achieved through intellectual contemplation (theoria) alone; divine blessings must be secured suprarationally through ritual practices such as prayer and blood sacrifice, while mystical ascent can be achieved only through the âhieratic artâ of theurgy, in which the celebrant made suitable through purification participates in the âgod-workâ (theourgia) that sustains and renews the cosmos. In Julianâs quasi-ecclesiastical vision of ecumenical paganism, theurgists functioned as high priests over provincial congregations of local cults, and organized philanthropic relief of the poor and sick in competition with Christian charity. 

Although generally supportive of the emperorâs program of temple reconstruction, religious toleration, and redirection of imperial subsidies back to traditional cults, very few of the empireâs pagans shared their emperorâs radical vision. While the Iamblichean school of theurgic Neoplatonism persisted into the sixth century among pagan elites such as Proclus and Damascius at the Athenian Academy, in Julianâs day it was represented by a minority of philosophers. Even the majority of Neoplatonists were heirs more to Plotinus and Porphyry, who valued rational contemplation above ritual practice, and especially rejected blood offerings. Likewise, animal sacrifice had already been falling out of fashion by the fourth century, such that toothless prohibitions by Christian emperors such as Constantius II caused little trouble and did not extend to offerings of incense or cakes.

On a political level, Julianâs ideological polarization of Christianity versus a united front of paganism rarely corresponded to reality. While the Altar of Victory that Constantius had removed from the Curia was restored under Julian, the largely traditionalist Roman Senate had not supported Julianâs revolt against Constantius, while the armyâs initial choice of Julianâs coreligionist Salutius to succeed the dead emperor in 363, which Salutius refused such that the Christian Jovian was elevated instead, suggests that an emperorâs personal religious affiliation was not so high a priority. It is telling of general attitudes at the time that the pagan soldier turned historian who served in that fateful Persian campaign, Ammianus Marcellinus, praised Julian highly for his military and political virtues, but largely criticized his zealous religious policies, such as his extravagant slaughter of sacrificial animals and edict forbidding Christians from serving as public school teachers. Although Julian did not violently persecute Christians, he nevertheless resembled the likes of Decius and Diocletian in that his divisive rhetoric of militant paganism largely clashed with the tolerant attitudes of the vast majority of the empireâs citizens, to a similar degree as the fulminations of Christian bishops such as Ambrose and John Chrysostom did not reflect the feelings of most Christians toward their pagan compatriots. The lynching of one such bishop in Alexandria, George of Cappadocia, by a pagan mob inspired by Julianâs accession in 361, should therefore not testify to pagansâ general attitudes towards Christians during his reign. 

In sum, the brevity of Julianâs 18-month career as sole Augustus precluded any potential success, and thus had little effect on the continuity or discontinuity of traditional practices in communities and households, which were largely maintained as a matter of civic pride and duty to ancestors. The pace of conversion to Christianity accelerated as much for its social and political opportunities as the religion of the new establishment as for its promises of spiritual reward on earth and in heaven.",361,363,132,1055,Jeremy Swist,49,Ian Randall,2022-03-07 19:33:08.468 +0100,2022-03-07 19:35:44.812 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.0073223216129651965,6.108378719817925e-10,1.6312785858482477e-15,0.0010263970367093013,1.3252953863727772e-25,6.752295199093373e-14,0.9916512803914659,3.479526255224057e-10,2.4514169698202902e-21
1323,Luguru,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Luguru (preferred name âWaluguruâ) reside in the Uluguru Mountains in what is now the United Republic of Tanzania. This entry focuses on the Luguru around the time of 1925, during which time control of the region was transitioning from the recently dissolved German Empire to the United Kingdom. One of the main sources of information for this entry (Scheerder and Tastevin, 1950) is written in French, and while English translations are provided for some specific quotes, the work in its entirety remains untranslated. French to English translations were obtained through Google Translate and reviewed by a native French speaker. At the time focus of this entry, the Luguru were organized into 50 exogamous and matrilineal clans that lived in densely populated villages. These matrilineages played an important part in the traditional Luguru religion: lineage leaders could also perform the tasks of religious leaders, and lineage ancestors were considered sacred and propitiated. In addition to lineage leaders, the Luguru recognized other religious leaders including rainmakers and diviners, who were in charge of ceremonies and the propitiation of supernatural beings. The Luguru believed in both a supreme high god (mulungu) and ancestral spirits although most religious practices were devoted to the latter. For example, during naming ceremonies, one could take the name of a lineage ancestor, thereby inviting the spirit into their body. The more names one had, the more prestige they held, and could take on special tasks such as communicating with ancestral spirits. For the Luguru, religious beliefs were inseparable from almost all aspects of social and political life. Therefore, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society at large.",1910,1935,1470,1090,Anj Droe,1,M.

1324,Taiping jing,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Taiping jing was compiled in the late 6th century by Daoist practitioners who were close to the Upper Clarity (shangqing ä¸æ¸) group whose basis was at Mount Mao (Maoshan èå±±), in Jurong County å¥å®¹å¸ of Jiangsu Province. Due to linguistic and doctrinal reasons, most scholars agree it originated in the late second century CE. It consists of roughly three textual layers. The bulk, layer A, is an account of meetings between a heaven-sent Celestial Master (tianshi å¤©å¸«) and a group of at least six students who have travelled from elsewhere to be instructed. They discuss the urgent need to actively promote universal great peace so as to prevent the approaching cataclysm that threatens the end of humankind and, in consequence, heaven and earth. The main topic is the need for widespread moral reforms. Regarding philosophical intention and terminology, layer A has parallels in Han dynasty (206 BCE- 220 CE) socio-political thought. Layer B contains conversations between a disciple and members of the celestial bureaucracy who discuss the chances for a career in the celestial bureaucracy. The disciple aims to turn immortal, which became the primary content of Daoist religious instruction. Layer C contains religious materials, in the form of talismans (fu ç¬¦) or reiterated characters (fuwen è¤æ), images and short Upper Clarity passages; it also includes a brief summary of layer A; several sections, composed in layer A style, propose positions divergent from those expressed in layer A.   
The 6th-century text was organised in ten divisions (bu é¨), 170 chapters (juan å·) and 366 sections. Simultaneous to the compilation, it was accepted into the Daoist Canon (Daozang éè). Due to the Canon's spurious transmission, parts of the Taiping jing were lost so that the text we have today has 57 chapters. It relies on the Canon that was printed in 1445. A manuscript preserved in Dunhuang (S 4226) contains the full table of contents of the 6th-century text. The 9th-century Taiping jing chao (Digest of the Taiping jing å¤ªå¹³ç¶é), in ten divisions, consists of excerpts from the full 6th-century text. We can draw conclusions from these two sources regarding parts of the 6th-century text that have not been transmitted.
For the four hundred years between the supposed origin of much of the Taiping jing and the creation of the transmitted text, there is hardly any evidence for the text's existence. Throughout the Han dynasty, the term great peace was widely used. Historical sources mention that in the outgoing first century BCE and again in the mid-second century CE, texts with great peace in their title were presented to emperors but did not find acceptance. These texts may have had some impact. Whether the second one, titled Taiping qingling shu (Book on great peace with the title written in blue å¤ªå¹³æ¸é æ¸), played a role in the Yellow Turban rebellion of 184 CE is under debate. The Yellow Turbans were originally the Great Peace Movement (Taiping dao å¤ªå¹³é) that had started well over a decade earlier. Daoist hagiographic sources, followed by a number of scholars, depict the second of these texts on great peace as the original version of the Taiping jing that entered the Daoist Canon. It was written by Gan Ji å¹²å, an expert in vitality techniques (fangshi æ¹å£«) in the region of Langya çç in the southeast of todayâs Shandong province and presented to Emperors Shun é¡º (r. 125-144) and Huan æ¡ (r.147-168). In 166 BCE, the scholar-official Xiang Kai è¥æ¥· travelled from Langya to the court to present the text and two memorials in its praise that official historical accounts have preserved. While there is no way to prove any material link between the Taiping qingling shu and the received Taiping jing, it is not impossible that layer A and layer B materials of the received text originated in the environment and at the time when Gan Ji and Xiang Kai were active.",150,2022,1132,1102,Barbara Hendrischke,45,Matthew Hamm,2022-03-08 23:08:08.365 +0100,2022-03-31 20:06:19.037 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.05706096462229355,0.21917846826891912,3.0051757112322397e-14,0.2951474364687512,0.0018605533426891295,0.024134728589559305,0.39751776386212795,0.005100059153050163,2.569257962476058e-08
1326,Meher KapÄ±sÄ± inscription (Urartian text),52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Meher KapÄ±sÄ± is a monumental rock carved niche located four kilometres north east of Van Kalesi, the site of the Urartian capital of TuÅ¡pa. Inside the niche a cuneiform text was carved, which defines the Urartian pantheon and sets ritual instructions. The text contains a long list of deities, starting with á¸ªaldi. The head of the Urartian pantheon is followed by TeiÅ¡eba, the weather god, and Å iuini, a solar deity. After the triad of the most important gods worshipped across the Urartian state, the text contains a long list of names, many of which are otherwise unknown deities. For each listed god there are instructions regarding the type and number of animals to be sacrificed during a yearly ritual. The text also mentions the gods of certain cities, without giving their names, and the gods of the lake and of the valley. 

Urartu developed from a series of small chiefdoms spread out on the Armenian Plateau, and had its capital established by Sarduri I on the eastern shores of Lake Van during the mid 9th century BCE. From what today is the modern city of Van, the royal dynasty created by Sarduri ruled until the first half of the 6th century BCE. At one point the main antagonist of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, Urartian territories stretched from Lake Sevan to the southern shore of Lake Urmia, and as far West as the sources of the Euphrates. Mostly known for their metalwork and their fortifications, Urartians had a well established religion with á¸ªaldi at the head of the pantheon.

1333,Cult of Thecla,43,Religious Group (v6),"The cult of Thecla was a widespread and popular devotion to Saint Thecla, reportedly a follower of Paul the Apostle. The foundational text of this report is the Acts of (Paul and) Thecla, a second century Greek story about the young virgin Thecla who renounces her betrothed in order to live a life of sexual abstinence. As the story goes, Thecla survived multiple attempts by the local authorities of public execution, making her a model of eventual martyrdom ideologies. Though some Christians thought the tale a forgery (notably Tertullian), in the third to seventh centuries devotion of Thecla spread across the Mediterranean, rivaling devotion to Mary the mother of Jesus. From Syria to Africa, Greece, and Spain, reverence to Thecla consisted of shrines, catacombs, churches and pilgrimages dedicated to her. While reverence to Thecla as a saint continues today, late antiquity was the high point of such adherence.

The types of people who participated in the cult of Thecla varied dramatically. Evagrius Scholasticus of the sixth century, for instance, records in his Ecclesiastical History that the fifth century emperor Zeno had a vision of Thecla, who encouraged him to march on Byzantium to reclaim his throne, which he did. Afterwards, Zeno had a church built to Thecla in Seleucia, home of a center of Theclan cultic activity. One of the functions of shrines, however, was to provide shelter to pilgrims, who both gave offerings and received sustenance. This cultic economy necessitates involvement from both those wealthy and powerful enough to act as benefactors to the cult (such as in the construction of the shrines themselves) and those of the (majority) poor who sought out the shrines to pay homage to the saint, hoping to receive blessings in return. As described by the fourth century pilgrim Egeria, the cult complex in Seleucia had âinnumerable monastic cells of men and of women,â with a head deaconess overseeing the virgins housed there.

Personal piety was also a major factor of the cult, which can be difficult to track for the majority of people. Items such as flasks or combs with engravings of Thecla are abundant, along with paintings and reliefs of scenes from the Acts of (Paul and) Thecla, as most notably evident in the Catacomb of Thecla (Rome) and the chapel at El Bagawat (Egypt). Famous Christians such as Gregory of Nyssa and Gregory of Nazianzus extolled Thecla as a moral exemplar, the latter even temporarily relocating to the shrine in Seleucia. This reverence reflected the concern for the body in some Christian circles, emphasizing the imperative of sexual purity, if not outright abstinence. It is implausible to imagine these kinds of moral ideologies belonged to the elite (for which have the most evidence) alone. Given Tertullianâs early negative disposition against the Acts of Thecla for the baptismal authority it seemed to grant women, it is no surprise that women in particular found power in the character of Thecla who defied the men of her life (even Paul!) to live an exemplary (chaste) Christian life.",150,600,1487,722,Ryan Fitzgerald,18,Robyn Walsh,2022-03-12 18:30:02.857 +0100,2022-05-11 18:30:25.993 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.0024734825976928925,0.21586822526819688,3.921284144475635e-15,0.15157507056774105,0.00014943407984563368,1.5398740739810069e-12,0.0007089906503233821,0.5625188433699894,0.06670595346466687
1334,No-debt Movement in US Evangelicalism,43,Religious Group (v6),"Financial crises and economic recessions over the past few decades have given rise to the no-debt movement in both religious and non-religious spaces. Many evangelicals in the United States, in particular, have embraced the no-debt movement that emphasizes debt elimination, financial stewardship, and generosity. Financial ministries such as Crown Financial Ministries and Dave Ramsey Solutions have become an integral part of the religious landscape as they provide resources, seminars, and curriculum to churches to help congregants get out of debt and generate wealth. The leaders of these ministries, in addition to pastors and church leaders, work to weave theology into financial practices to help adherents view debt through a theological lens. 

The no-debt movement is not only evangelical in its theology but also reflects American values and culture of freedom and agency. Although there has also been an increase of non-religious no-debt organizations and leaders who promote similar practices as evangelical no-debt leaders, the evangelical no-debt movement adds a theological lens into the American financial experience that provides adherents with new language and new practices. Debt is viewed as a form of slavery and adherents of the no-debt movement use various biblical texts to support their position. The only appropriate response to debt is to attack it until it is gone. This means that many people in the no-debt movement adjust their financial lifestyles in order to aggressively pay off debt. 

In addition to the aversion of debt, the evangelical no-debt movement promotes the concept of stewardship and generosity. Stewardship is the belief that God created everything and things like money, assets, and wealth belong to God, not the person. God entrusts people to manage assets like money and they are responsible for stewarding Godâs money well. Excessive consumer debt is a sign that a person has not been a good steward of what God has given them and thus they need to make changes in their thinking and actions in order to get in line with Godâs way of handling finances. Once a person is out of debt they are able to become more effective stewards of Godâs provision because they can now be generous with what God has given them. Many adherents of the no-debt movement promote generosity as one of the ultimate goals of financial freedom. God give people money and wealth so they can steward it well and give it away to people in need.",1980,2022,1608,762,Nathan Womack,5,Courtney Fitzsimmons,2022-03-13 17:48:58.865 +0100,2022-07-14 01:06:05.092 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),7.829830825526338e-05,0.05625981671840208,1.5269832741509745e-15,0.15261722731893193,1.81663742168168e-05,7.564080753386075e-13,3.9065951003283914e-05,0.715340567523567,0.07564685780486556
1335,Congregation of the Oratory,43,Religious Group (v6),"In 1575 a group of priests and men interested in religious life became the Congregation of the Oratory with the papal approval of Gregory XIII. In so doing they became one of many such groups of religious life founded in the Roman Catholic Church of the sixteenth century. Unlike many of these other orders, the Oratorians were not founded with a hierarchical structure enabled to organize a global order, but as a society of apostolic life. As such they were not bound to a central authority, but committed to a self-governing community. This presents a challenge for speaking about Oratorians as a group even in small chronological and geographic confines. Nevertheless, given that Oratorians drew inspiration from the original Roman Oratory inspired by Philip Neri, it is both critical and fundamental to understand Neriâs life and the Oratory he founded in sixteenth-century Rome in order to make any generalizations about the Congregation of the Oratory. Neri, born a Florentine in 1515 Neri spent most of his adult life in Rome after a conversion experience that drew him into the practice of religion. He spent many of his early years in Rome as a committed layperson until he was ordained in 1551. In those years he began a ministry that included engaging with people on the streets of Rome about religion. Rigorous asceticism, a commitment to learning about ancient Christianity, and a profound commitment to Catholic aesthetics through the visual and musical arts characterized his devotional life. Over time he developed a following from laypeople as well as ordained religious that became the Oratory, distinct from the congregation. Here, the Oratory refers to program of spiritual exercises that Neri orchestrated and led in Rome. At first spontaneity was the defining feature of these spiritual meetings, but over time these meetings became arranged in a more consistent format and included brief sermons, historical lessons, and hymns. Philip focused most of his attention on developing and sustaining these spiritual conferences rather than on the government of the group in Rome and the other Oratories it inspired. In this respect, it is fruitful to compare him with Saint Ignatius, the founder of the Society of Jesus. While both oriented their lifeâs work to the revitalization of Roman Catholicism, Ignatius exerted much of his emphasis in the governance of the Society he founded through his literary correspondence and perhaps more importantly by bequeathing his order with the Constitutions, which became the foundation for the Jesuit way of life. In contrast, the first Oratorian rule was only confirmed in 1612 by Paul V, seventeen years after Philipâs death. In some ways this reflects Neriâs reluctance to found a religious group at all. He preferred to encourage men to join other religious orders. Philip expected Oratorians to spend two hours at the oratory, preach or attend four sermons a day,   preach peripatetically throughout the city, attend matins, and visit hospitals. Oratorian work was not limited to these activities. He also encouraged members of the Oratory to take part in catechizing children, and give individual spiritual direction. He was personally famous for seeing people in direction throughout the day. In addition, he commissioned some of his followers to take on specific tasks that he deemed critical. Perhaps the most significant of these assignments for the greater intellectual world of Early Modern Catholicism, if not Early Modern Europe, was the project he envisioned for Cesar Baronius: a complete history of the Church that became the Annales ecclesiastici. This multi volume work prioritized Neriâs longstanding interest in Church History, which featured in both his personal devotional life and in the works of the Oratory. These efforts earned Neri and his Oratory a reputation for holiness and virtue, so much so that when Gregory XV raised Neri to sainthood alongside Teresa of Ãvila, Ignatius Loyola, Francis Xavier, and Isidore the Farm Laborer, an aphorism echoed through the alleys of Rome saying: âwe have canonized four Spaniards and one saint.â Neriâs reputation for holiness was enhanced by his supposed thaumaturgic powers and his status as a holy mystic taken to frequent ecstatic or rapturous experiences, many of which happened while Neri meditated before a work of sacred art or heard sacred music. Neri and the Oratorians were committed to the revitalization of Catholicism in its very heart, Rome. Their approach emphasized outreach to laypeople and pilgrims and highlighted many of the features that made Catholicism distinct, both a sensuous approach through preaching, music, arts, and architecture, and an emphasis on personal piety that emphasized intellectual stimulation and asceticism.",1575,1700,991,799,Thomas Santa Maria,40,Stephen Christopher,2022-03-14 23:43:30.467 +0100,2022-04-20 03:48:42.881 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),1.55628615619442e-14,4.480710126074313e-25,0.0586002264332268,4.3150899958286073e-13,0.01380353698352394,1.1359433452558253e-34,4.4873833014124744e-06,1.5398906170483664e-22,0.9275917491995008
1338,The Sayings of the Desert Fathers,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Sayings of the Desert Fathers is attributed to specific monks in the Egyptian and Palestinian deserts. It is an example of ancient literature called apophthegmata, consisting of sayings by and stories about well-regarded figures of wisdom. While the original material was likely passed down orally in Coptic for some time, the oldest written version is in Greek.
There are two principal versions of this material organized in different ways. One collection is organized alphabetically according to the names of the monks cited and written about. The other collection is thematic, with sayings and stories organized according to themes such as ""Self-Control,"" ""Non-judgment,"" and ""Humility."" While the collections abound in overlapping material, the sayings and stories are not entirely identical between the two. 
While the majority of the monks represented in the text are from the Egyptian regions of Scetis and Nitria in the 4th century C.E., the collection was compiled and redacted in the early 5th century in Palestine. 
The overwhelming theme of The Sayings of the Desert Fathers is asceticism. The compiler/redactor shaped the material to focus on commonalities in ascetic practice which belie what is now known to be a vast variety of beliefs and practices in Egypt and Palestine.",390,500,1489,1128,Joshua Schachterle,49,Ian Randall,2022-03-16 18:09:32.518 +0100,2022-11-08 23:46:13.583 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.006821051973990176,0.1458258771953293,0.157262451059556,0.08800590349841463,0.22703925436106726,0.08062147180923494,0.013475309257536964,0.10181100389012387,0.17913767695474686
1340,International Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centers,43,Religious Group (v6),"The International Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centers (ISYVC) are an organisation that operates yoga and retreat or training centres (ashrams) in the Americas, Europe, and Asia. These Centres are the trademark holder of 'Sivananda Yoga', which is, amongst practitioners, widely perceived as a distinct style of Hatha Yoga and they credit the ISYVC as the legitimate bearer of this tradition or âlineageâ. The organisation prides itself in teaching âtraditional yogaâ and propagates neo-Hindu teachings, referencing the guru-parampara tradition (guru lineage) of Swami Sivananda (1887-1963) and Swami Vishnu-devananda (1927-1993). The main teachings concern the practice of the â4 paths of yogasâ and the â5 points of yogaâ, as well as a sequence of 12 yoga asanas (postures) commonly referred to as âSivananda sequence or âRishikesh series. The four paths are: Bhakti Yoga (path of devotion), Karma Yoga (path of selfless action), Jnana Yoga (path of wisdom, study of Vedanta), and Raja Yoga (control of body and mind, which includes Hatha Yoga/postural yoga). The five points of yoga are: 1. Proper Exercise â Asanas 2. Proper Breathing â Pranayama 3. Proper Relaxation â Savasana 4. Proper Diet â Vegetarian 5. Positive Thinking and Meditation â Vedanta and Dhyana. 
According to ISYVCâs self-published teacher training manual (Ch. 1.14), Vishnu-devananda was sent from India to the West in the late 1950s by his guru Sivananda, to teach yoga and Vedanta. Following prolonged international travel teaching yoga, Vishnu-devananda eventually settled in MontrÃ©al, Canada, where he established the first Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centre, and later, the Sivananda Ashram Yoga Camp in the Laurentian mountains, a retreat and training centre, which serves as the organisation's headquarters. 
By March 2022, the organisation is running 11 ashrams (retreat and training centres) in North America (3), the Caribbean (1), Europe (2), India (4), and Vietnam (1), as well as 27 yoga centres located in bigger cities around the world, according to ISYVC's website. Another 33 centres are registered as âaffiliated centresâ and are run in a franchise system by adherents of the organisation and graduates of their yoga teacher training courses. 
The ISYVC runs three resident programs: the four-week Yoga Teacher Training Course (TTC) and the Advanced Yoga Teacher Training Course (ATTC), as well as a three-week practice programme called Sadhana Intensive (SI). These programs also constitute the organisationâs main source of revenue, with prices ranging from approx. 1,500 USD (TTC in India, dorm accommodation) to 5,800 USD (TTC in the Bahamas, single accommodation) (prices valid in March 2022). During the Covid-pandemic, the organisation had to close most of its centres and retreat locations around the world and started to implement online courses for yoga classes and teacher training. From April 2022 until December 2022, the ISYVC programme calendar lists 36 TTCs that are due to start, with 3-5 courses of 4 weeks length starting each month, taught in a variety of languages. 
The model of a 4-week teacher training is an established standard in the yoga industry that is based on the 200h qualification recignised by Yoga Alliance. The ISYVC claims that the 4-week TTC method was first introduced by their guru-founder Vishnu-devananda in the 1950s/60s. According to the ISYVC, the organisation has trained around 50,000 yoga teachers since the implementation of their programme (as of March 2022, according to ISYVC website). 
Although widely perceived as a provider of yoga classes and trainings, the ISYVC organisation also operates as a religious group, upholding a monastic order, in which many full-time members are initiated. ISYVC commits to the aim to propagate Hinduism and the teachings of Sivananda. The organisation does not pay teachers in yoga or training centres and operates all their activities with volunteers (karma yogis) who work without remuneration for several hours per week (as non residents), or stay as volunteers for up to several months. Full-time residents are called 'staff' by the organisation, but are also unpaid and receive lodging, food and some access to the teaching programme in exchange for free labour. Many full-time residents are encouraged to take vows of renunciation, i.e. brahmacarya (novice status that requires celibacy) or sannyas (i.e. becoming swami: monk or nun). 
In 2019, a #metoo scandal shook the ISYVC community when several former adherents publicly made allegations of sexual abuse and other types of abuse against the guru-founder Vishnu-devananda and other senior leaders in the organisation. It later was established that allegations against the guru-founder had been known to the organisation's leadership since at least 2007 (see statement of the board members, Dec 16, 2019). Consequently, a community of former and current adherents of ISYVC formed a Facebook group and organised an independent investigation into allegations of sexual abuse and other types of abuse within ISYVC. This undertaking is called âProject SATYAâ. The Project compiled three reports that contain a counter-narrative to the hagiographical stories provided by the organisation and its devotees and documenting over several allegations of sexual abuse and other abuses by the founder and others within leadership of ISYVC. .
With only few etic and non-hagiographical accounts of the ISYVC and its history, the resources of Project SATYA are referenced throughout this entry. It should be noted that there is a lack of independent sources on the history of the Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centres and the biographies of its gurus. Even some academic work relies on hagiographical sources or inadvertently prioritises hagiographical accounts and reproduces admiration. Wherever this entry references resources of the ISYVC or other yoga organisations, it should be noted that they are likely hagiographical, even when not explicitly indicated. 
The organisation is not to be confused with Sivananda Ashram, Rishikesh (India) or its subsidies, which are operated by the Divine Life Society (DLS).",1957,2023,1493,1116,Jens Uwe Augspurger,40,Stephen Christopher,2022-03-18 10:37:48.578 +0100,2023-02-20 17:34:43.274 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.015420995172871911,0.3626252897097113,2.0256589974954467e-15,0.0059538674820113465,7.77542757540333e-16,2.1996387877939765e-14,0.6159998351521565,1.2483188812974013e-08,3.5267159082522024e-14
1341,Muslim Students Association of the United States and Canada,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Muslim Students Association of the United States and Canada (popularly known as MSA) is a network of Muslim communities that gather at and draw their support from college campuses. The history of the MSA dates back to the early sixties, a time period when Muslim migrants from the MENA (Middle East North Africa) region, South Asia, and Far East Asia migrated in large numbers to the United States in pursuit of graduate training in STEM fields and humanities. The earliest conventions of the MSA were held on college campuses in the Midwest region, including the University of Illinois campus in Champaign-Urbana. While majority of the MSA presidents were male graduate students, their wives played an even greater role in the growth of the Muslim Students Association by establishing the Womenâs Committee of the Muslim Students Association. One of the key ritual practices of the Muslim Students Association is the Quran Study Circle. It had been organized on college campuses such as Karachi University, Pakistan long before the pioneers of the Muslim Students Association migrated to the United States. Through discussing commentaries on the Quran collectively, students sought to upend the separation of religion from higher education that had been brought forth by colonization and elevate Islam as a methodological hook for an integrative model of learning. In the United States, the Quran Study Circle addressed the shared concerns of women around childrearing. Its participants were the pioneers of the Womenâs Committee of the MSA. They gathered at each otherâs homes and leveraged the Quran as a prompt for discussing shared experience of parenting and raising young Muslim children in suburban and ex-urban landscapes where there had been no existing institutional presence of Islam. These conversations inspired the growth of the North American Islamic School Movement. Examples include Al-Fatih Academy, a K-8th grade Islamic School that offers an integrative model of education with hopes of helping its student body learn to cognize their emotions. In addition to the development of Islamic schools, the Muslim Students Association also gave birth to the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA). Located in Plainfield, Indiana, ISNA seeks to elevate Islam and uplift Muslim-American communities through interfaith dialogue and civic engagement. One of the enduring hallmarks of the Muslim Students Association has been a distinctively feminine approach to activism centered around building relationships and cultivating emotional connection across religious, national, and racial lines of difference. MSAâs commitment to a transnational ummah/community is best exemplified by the deep bonds of friendship and camaraderie between the movementâs pioneers that endure to this day.",1960,2022,1494,358,SherAfgan Tareen,5,Courtney Fitzsimmons,2022-03-21 15:37:12.567 +0100,2022-07-05 22:55:35.334 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),6.928341618021283e-05,0.10085989256906637,6.7466990488445664e-15,0.09161316109354962,0.06477303755026832,0.561160319155738,2.2106048068829067e-05,0.18150197422601805,2.2594110393232038e-07
1342,Pauline Epistles,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Pauline epistles refer to the seven authentic Pauline letters: Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Philippians, 1 Thessalonians, and Philemon. Even though 13 letters in the New Testament are attributed to Paul these seven are widely regarded to have Paul as their author (in addition to the seven authentic letters, Ephesians, Colossians, 2 Thessalonians, 1 and 2 Timothy, and Titus are attributed to Paul). The Pauline epistles, written approx. 50â62 CE, cover an array of topics, from grand theological/philosophical questions to concrete, on-the-ground issues that arose in the Christ groups. It is important to note that even though later Christianity has based much of its theology in Paulâs letters (for example, Martin Lutherâs famous âjustification by faithâ comes from Romans 1:17), the letters are incidental and written to specific assemblies at a specific point in time. For example, Paul only mentions the celebration of the ""Lord's supper"" in 1 Corinthians 11 because the Christ followers in Corinth celebrated the ritual in a faulty manner, according to the apostle. A further point about the Pauline epistles is that many (if not all) of them are primarily addressed to gentile Christ followers and that the topics Paul covers in his letters mainly concern gentiles in-Christ and how they should live.
	Both during his own time and after his death, Paul left a significant mark on the growing Jesus movement, and later the established church. This can be seen in a number of ways. First, the five letters that are not regarded by scholars as authentic (i.e., Paul did not write them even though they are attributed to him) show the importance in having Paul as the (claimed) author to a text in the early Jesus movement. Second, 2 Peter 3:15â16 explicitly mentions Paul and how his writings can be hard to understand. Third, as Paulâs letters make up a considerable part of the New Testament (especially if one counts all 13 letters that are attributed to him), his texts were viewed as important documents by the early Jesus movement when it started to form its canon and decided which texts were foundational for the life of the emerging church.
	The Pauline epistles have been read, studied, and influential since they were first written, and they continue to be so today. Gaining a deeper understanding of this letter collection helps us better understand the origins of what today is Christianity, Jewish Christian relations in the first century CE, and the ideas that exists in one of the most influential textual corpora in the modern West.",50,62,1495,1134,Martin Sanfridson,50,Andrew Danielson,2022-03-21 18:46:41.381 +0100,2022-03-21 18:46:41.381 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.0008210555565041998,0.01248149937657815,0.007763477286623889,0.5846261398560957,0.3940410112472685,2.2655998311782777e-11,0.00026211988963635086,6.1527332489943225e-12,4.696758484606961e-06
1347,"The Praise of the Bees, Exultet Hymn",52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The medieval hymn Exultet was probably compiled around the 5th - 6th century by an unknown author (probably Saint Augustine, Ambrose, or Jerome). It was chanted before the paschal candle during the Easter Vigil in the Roman Rite of Mass (Easter Proclamation). It was named after the first word of the hymn Exultet iam angelica turba coelorum...and contains references to resurrection and eschatology.  of special and particular interest is the part of the hymn known as the Praise of the Bees, which forms an exclamation of the insect as creator of the holy wax, the honey, and as a symbol of Virgin Mary due to its reputed -then- physical chastity. There were two textual versions of the hymn, the earliest Beneventan and the later Franco-roman version.

1348,Disability-focused Christianity for Palestinians,43,Religious Group (v6),"This group includes the many Christian-based NGOs and parachurch ministries in Bethlehem that are providing services for people with disabilities. Most institutes employ Muslims as well as Christians but are Christian in name and practice. Most of the Christians, then, belong to recognized churches in addition to this group.

I conducted 12 months of ethnographic fieldwork with two NGOs in Bethlehem providing services for people with (primarily intellectual) disabilities (May 2021- May 2022). Most of the data in this article is based on my primary methods of participant observation and semi-structured interviews. Over this time I visited 12 different organizations and interviewed their staff. While each NGO is organizationally separate, they are unified by friendships of varying closeness (and some familiar ties), a shared purpose in improving the lives of people with disabilities in the region, and in some cases, the same people receiving services (some simultaneously and others at different times). Some of the staff have rotated between the organizations as well. 

Another feature that unifies this group is the relatively marginal support they receive from local churches. Most individuals are connected with the major denominations, regularly attending a Catholic, Orthodox, or Lutheran church, but a lot of support (emotional, financial, staffing) comes from international churches or non-church Palestinian institutions, like local universities. Collegiate special education programs provide regular and reliable volunteers for several of these organizations as students complete their practical training.

Something that distinguishes this group from other members of the same denominations is their understanding and practice of inter-faith dialogue. Along with other interfaith initiatives in the West Bank and Bethlehem in particular, these disability-related organizations demonstrate a high-level of collaboration, as will be detailed more in the qualitative notes of this entry.

While small numerically, this group is important to consider because of the disproportional impact it has on its community. See the primary source, âMapping of Christian Organizations in Palestine: Social and Economic Impactâ (George Akroush). As Bethlehem has developed and urbanized, it has become a hub of services for Palestinians, medical and otherwise. There are significantly fewer resources available for people living in the villages surrounding Bethlehem, and some will even come from the villages of Hebron and Ramallah to receive services. While growing, the organizations as a whole still struggle to provide all of the services needed.",2012,2022,1502,802,Kevin Vollrath,40,Stephen Christopher,2022-04-03 17:35:14.814 +0200,2022-11-23 11:22:59.468 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),1.1566194132941026e-05,0.04823464501674903,3.915087721829286e-15,0.024314994566629777,0.0013906369500424481,1.4102099349190877e-12,5.062293243305799e-06,0.834907626491756,0.09113546848603242
1349,The Dingxiang Wang Cult,43,Religious Group (v6),"Dingxiang Wang is a multifaceted deity from the area of Changsha, Hunan, China, who became an important object of Hunanese worship both within and beyond the province in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The earliest mention of this deity dates back to the Song, during which he was described as the city god (chenghuang) of Tanzhou. He first appeared with frequency in the Qing as a local deity, and then the city god (chenghuang) of Shanhua County, Hunan, which was centered in Changsha. Legends describe him variously as the spirit of an upright demon-quelling official, a flood-calming official, or a locust-eating official, all of whom sacrificed themselves for Changsha. In 1847, he is said to have emerged from the Xiang River and possessed the body of a water-seller, and then marched to the magistrateâs yamen and reported for duty as the city god. He thus took on the aspect of a scholar-official, and several accounts indicate that he advised many hopeful participants in the provincial examinations. In 1852, during the Taiping siege of Changsha, Dingxiang Wang was one of at least two deities (including Li Zhenren) whose images were brought to the top of the city walls in an attempt to repel the enemy. Dingxiang Wang was reported to have been effective: When he was turned towards the battlefield, enemy cannon-fire was repelled, and the Taiping soldiers scaling the walls were pushed into midair. His legends state that he manifested as a spectral general who paced the walls and could be seen in a pavilion atop the wall, planning and directing the battle. For this service, Dingxiang Wang received the official moniker âyongzhen.â Dingxiang Wang thus became closely associated with the Xiang Army (Hunan Army), a military force that emerged from Changsha-area social networks. Its leaders, including Zeng Guofang and Zuo Zongtang, then received visions and guidance from Dingxiang Wang during their campaigns across the Qing. Dingxiang Wang was known to Xiang Army soldiers not only as a healer, but as a protector, as they fought the Taiping, Nian, and northwestern Muslim rebels all the way to Kashgar in Xinjiang. His worshippers, including the army's leaders but particularly demobilized soldiers, left temples to him across China, where he began to take on other meanings. Dingxiang Wang manifested again in the Sino-French War (1884â1885), in which he protected the coast from foreign cannons, following which he received another title, ""fushun."" The two known images of him reflect the same combination of aspects: he appears as an upright Confucian scholar-official, but with a tiger skin over his shoulders, indicating military prowess. In Xinjiang, meanwhile, a distinct tradition emerged by the early 1890sânot long after the arrival of Hunanese settlers in 1877âin which the Dingxiang Wang legend was adapted to reflect soldiers' experiences in the borderland, while the deity himself was referred to as ""Fangshen."" The deity was now said to have been an exiled soldier who, earlier in the Qing, had bravely protected his fellows by diving into a flooded fortress, saving them but sacrificing himself. By the 1910s, he was considered the special city god of Han settlers in Xinjiang. At the same time, he appeared as the protector of Changsha and of Nanjing in the Warlord Era, while newspaper reports indicated that in the 1920s he manifested several times in Changsha in order to punish the wicked. Worship continued in the homeland only until the late 1930s, at which point he fell into obscurity. This was the occasion for the compilation of an important temple gazetteer in Nanjing, where one of his âtemporary residencesâ (xinggong) was very active as a center of Hunanese life. He was still known in Xinjiang into the 1990s. The Dingxiang Wang cult thus defined a complex diasporic community.",1124,1991,1503,1140,Eric Schluessel,45,Matthew Hamm,2022-04-04 03:48:16.969 +0200,2022-04-04 19:33:53.755 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.05639132462431719,0.1306402430775893,1.015088717643642e-13,0.17859260111184969,0.0002650199133283398,6.336715986070108e-13,0.3157820970838284,0.28176804683907614,0.03656066734927588
1352,ÅÄkadvÄ«pÄ«ya BrÄhmaá¹as,43,Religious Group (v6),"The ÅÄkadvÄ«pÄ«ya (or Maga) BrÄhmaá¹as are a little known Brahmanical group mainly settled in RÄjasthÄn and BihÄr. According to the ancient texts, they are Hindu Sun worshippers but also include Buddhist, Jaina and Iranian features in their cult. In the SÄmba- and Bhaviá¹£ya-purÄá¹a, the story of their legendary migration is told: SÄmba, KrÌ¥á¹£á¹aâs son, is hit by leprosy, and only the Sun god can heal him. For this reason, the ÅÄkadvÄ«pÄ«ya BrÄhmaá¹as, experts in Sun cult, are called from Iran to Northern India to worship the god and heal SÄmbaâs sickness. Very interestingly, many Iranian elements are present both in the content and in the language of these PurÄá¹ic passages, such as Iranian loanwords, ritual objects and customs.  
Over the centuries, the ÅÄkadvÄ«pÄ«ya presence is registered in India in epigraphic sources, in the peculiar Sun god iconography with Iranian traits, by the astrologer and astronomer VarÄhamihira (6th century CE), travellersâ, and three late poems, namely the Magavyakti, the SÄmvavijaya and the Khalavaktracapeá¹­ika  (probably ca. 16th century), which record the family names and further legends on the ÅÄkadvÄ«pÄ«yas. They must have been very famous in northern courts in some periods, especially in relation to Sun worship, and even the fact that their texts have been inserted in the PurÄá¹ic literature testifies to their social importance; the same is valid for the later poems. 
Their cult is perfectly inserted in the syncretistic tendency that has characterized North Indian cults since the first centuries CE, when some groups living in the lands in between Iran and India moved to North India and established powerful reigns there. The ÅÄkadvÄ«pÄ«yas may have followed the same route, settled in India, built their sacred places, and specialised in Sun cult. 
Nowadays, ÅÄkadvÄ«pÄ«ya communities are still present on Indian soil, in the same ancient areas of settlement. ÅÄkadvÄ«pÄ«ya priests are still versed in astrology and the main solar festivals are still celebrated by the community. Unfortunately, the new generations are generally not interested in their peculiar customs, and most of them are aware of belonging to a specific tradition only because of marriage endogamic policies. However, in the last years, small groups of ÅÄkadvÄ«pÄ«ya people have started again cultivating the interest in their traditions and rediscovered their ancient customs. To revitalise the community, new associations have been created and some magazines, like the RÄjasthÄni BrahmaÌnÌ£dÌ£ CetnaÌ, have been published on monthly basis.",2,21,1505,1119,Martina Palladino,24,Travis Chilcott,2022-04-06 13:29:57.239 +0200,2022-04-20 09:03:58.505 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.00807629410852817,3.533402982577569e-11,8.40873150636112e-16,3.5414959575435874e-11,8.571438600014546e-27,5.943377369786462e-15,0.991923705820716,9.241779219345505e-22,1.5611735483568852e-32

1357,Encratites,43,Religious Group (v6),"Itâs a popular early Christian movement characterized by the defense of chastity, rejection of marriage and perhaps a refusal of meat and wine. However, itâs a poorly defined movement as there arenât clear boundaries of where and when it took place and who were its adherents. 
The name comes from the Greek word egkrateia, which means restraint from oneâs emotions and desires and self-control. This was considered a virtue in the Greco-Roman world, and examples of communities that abstained from sex and had strict diets are abundant already in pre-Christian communities. In Christian context, Encratism appears in second-century charges of heresists against Marcion, Saturninus and Tatian. But in addition to naming a heresy and identifying a specific group, encratism it is also understood as a general tendency of eschatological early Christian communities to refuse sex and sexuality. 
In the first scenario, we have the writings of Church Fathers, namely Irenaeus (185) and Clement of Alexandria (190), accusing Marcion and Saturninus of presenting marriage as corruption and Tatian of advancing these ideas. Irenaeus and Hippolytus (ca.225) also mention they abstain from eating living things (probably meat). Jerome (385) is the first Church Father to also add refusal of wine as an Encratite rule.
According to these Fathers, Encratic rules were based on theological formulations about salvation. Tatian would've posited that Adam and Eve created separation from the Holy Spirit through the original sin putting humans and animals on the same level. As a consequence, humans acquired animalistic characteristics such as mortality and sex drive. The vegetarian diet and chastity were intended to lessen these characteristics and bring humans close to their original purity and proximity with the Holy Spirit.
In the second scenario, it seems that from the second century throughout Late Antiquity, Christians from several sects adopted at least some form of continence or dietary restrictions. Whether Encratism was an actual movement or just a widespread practice is uncertain. Its interwoven with other movements is clear in the Edict of 382, for example. In the document, the Emperor Theodosius pronounces a death sentence to all that take the name of Encratites and affirms they are Manichaeans (another persecuted sect) in disguise.
In scholarship, encratism has been used interchangeably with early Christian asceticism. It has also been linked to the Gospel of Thomas, Gospel of the Egyptians, the Apocryphal Acts, particularly in relation to chaste women, and passages of the New Testament (Luke 2:36; Matt 1:24; I Tim 4:1-4).",100,400,1517,1136,Naiara LeÃ£o,49,Ian Randall,2022-04-07 20:35:50.838 +0200,2022-04-13 01:23:56.188 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.02628345065306254,0.2077407262089591,0.01713637148047522,0.021367969929624215,1.357753514421515e-12,0.02918791932884078,0.6982835527037421,9.693938259983155e-09,9.051270431765577e-19

1367,Targums,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The meaning of the Aramaic word ×ª×¨××× 'targum' (pl.×ª×¨××××× 'targumim') is 'translation' or 'interpretation'. It derives from the Akkadian word targummanu(m) 'interpreter, translator', which first occured in the beginning of the second millenium BCE. The Aramaic word was later adopted in Hebrew and Arabic.
The term generally refers to written translations in any language. In the context of biblical (and Jewish) studies, it primarily refers to renderings of biblical texts in Aramaic; i.e. Targums. The Targums are interpretative reproductions of the original (Hebrew) biblical text for the Aramaic-speaking Jewish audience. They consist of both translational renderings of the Hebrew text and additional material (additions, omissions, interpretative interpolations) which provide insights into ancient Jewish interpretation of biblical narratives. 
There are Targums to all books of the Bible except for Ezra and Daniel, the biblical books which include Aramaic portions. Targum Onqelos is a targum of the Pentateuch, and Targum Jonathan is a targum to the Prophets; In addition, there is also Targum Pseudo-Jonathan, Targum Neofiti and the so-called Fragment Targum. However, different books of the Writings were composed individually.
From the Qumran we have evidence that some written Targums (eg. the Qumran Job Targum) existed in early times and that they were known to Rabbi Gamaliel I and Gamaliel II. More recent Targumic manuscripts come from the sixteenth century. However, the main period in which the Targumic tradition was - so to say - at its 'peak' is the period between the 1st and the 7th century (mainly the period of rabbinic Judaism).",70,601,1521,770,Srecko Koralija,18,Robyn Walsh,2022-04-14 17:38:28.034 +0200,2022-04-20 16:09:56.680 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),6.928341618021283e-05,0.10085989256906637,6.7466990488445664e-15,0.09161316109354962,0.06477303755026832,0.561160319155738,2.2106048068829067e-05,0.18150197422601805,2.2594110393232038e-07

This entry focuses on the Teda of Tibesti around the time of 1925. At this time, this region was part of French Equatorial Africa and therefore under the political control of France. Although the Teda live in a highly remote area, Tibesti is located along important caravan routes that have historically given the Teda both control over trade and a high level of contact with other societies and religious groups. The majority of Teda are Muslim, having likely been converted early in the spread of Islam across Africa (Simpson 2011:7). Prayer is very important, as are certain holidays, such as Ramadan, and pilgrimages. Among the Teda, Islamic practices appear to have been largely syncretic with the traditional Teda religion practiced before conversion to Islam. However, during the time focus of this entry, influences from an Islamic missionary group resulted in more fundamental practices of Islam among the Teda.

1371,Twelver Shi'ism in post-revolutionary Iran,43,Religious Group (v6),"Twelver Shiâism, also known as Ithna âAshari, Twelvers or Imami Shiâa, is the main branch of Shiâa Islam and maintains the largest population of Shiâa Muslims worldwide. It has a population of around 200 million and constitutes the majority in Iran, Iraq, Bahrain, and Azerbaijan. What characterizes Twelver Shiâism in terms of their fundamental beliefs is their view on the successorship of Muhammad, the Prophet of Islam. For them, Ali, Muhammadâs son-in-law and cousin, and eleven of Aliâs direct descendants, known as Imams, are the sole religious and political authorities after the Prophet. This belief further defines the way in which the religiopolitical identity of Twelver Shiâism has been developed through the course of history.

Iran has the largest Twelver Shiâa population, estimated at approximately 76-80 million, i.e. 90-95% of todayâs Iranian population. Twelver Shiâism is the state religion of Iran since the 16th century, and its legal and theological doctrines are integrated into the countryâs legal code and constitution. After the Iranian revolution of 1979, Iranâs constitution was significantly revised to better reflect the Twelversâ ideology and legal thought. Specifically, the theory of Vilayat-e Mutlaqe-ie Faqih [the guardian juristâs absolute authority] was incorporated into the Iranian legal system. According to this theory, strongly advocated by Ayatollah Khumayni, the founder and former leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the stateâs major decisions must be supervised and confirmed by a Twelver Shiâa Mujtahid, a  scholar of the highest-ranking in Shiâa legal thought. Therefore, by the constitution, the head of the Iranian state today, i.e. its supreme leader, has to be a Twelver Shiâa Mujtahid, elected by the Council of Experts, a deliberative assembly of more than eighty other Twelver Shiâa Mujtahids.This suffices to show how religion and state are interconnected in Iran. Also, Twelver Shiâa ideology is deeply intertwined with various areas of Iranian culture, economy, education, etc. and its footprints can be observed all over the post-revolutionary Iranian public life. It also plays a significant role in defining Iranâs international diplomacy. For example, the Iran-Israel ongoing conflict is deeply rooted in the Twelversâ religious ideology and the role of Iranian religious leadership in defining the stateâs international relations. 

In sum, contemporary Iranian cultural, political, and social values are heavily influenced by Twelver Shiâism ideology, legal thought, and worldview. For the purpose of this entry, our focus centers around documenting ideological, cultural, social, and political tenets that characterize Twelver Shiâism in post-revolutionary Iran (1979-current).",1979,2022,1526,1117,Hasan Doagoo,43,Quinn Clark,2022-04-15 22:51:28.600 +0200,2022-04-27 22:25:13.959 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),3.9893265808570504e-18,4.7888139449140456e-15,0.021457653248477326,6.209563483711866e-14,0.037912619007286714,2.0125276035528358e-35,9.81949900093689e-08,5.667772547394993e-23,0.9406296295491792
1374,The Reformed Church (Early Orthodoxy),43,Religious Group (v6),"The period often identified as Reformed orthodoxy (alternatively, Reformed scholasticism) within the history of the Reformed church lasts from approximately 1560 until 1800. It is traditionally subdivided into three shorter periods: early orthodoxy (1560â1620), high orthodoxy (1620â1700), and late orthodoxy (1700â1800). Most historians fix the beginning of early orthodoxy to the transition from the second to the third generation of reformers, as Peter Martyr Vermigli (d. 1562), Wolfgang Musculus (d. 1563), John Calvin (d. 1564), and their second-generation peers were replaced by Theodore Beza, Zacharius Ursinus, Girolamo Zanchi, and others. It was a period of solidification for the Reformed tradition, witnessing the spread of confessional statements of faithâincluding the Gallic Confession (1559), Belgic Confession (1561), Second Helvetic Confession (1562), Heidelberg Catechism (1563), and eventually the Canons of Dort (1619)âwhich delineated the boundaries of the Reformed faith and reinforced its differences with other forms of Protestantism. The theology of the period is marked by a return to the scholastic method of the late medieval period and the rise of intra-Reformed disputes about particular theological doctrines (e.g., predestination), a trend which intensified throughout the first half of the seventeenth century as disputes turned increasingly to the minutiae of Reformed theology. The end of early orthodoxy has been located as early as 1620 (with the Canons of Dort serving as the approximate conclusion of the period in Willem van Asseltâs periodization) to as late as the 1640s (with the end of the Thirty Yearsâ War and the Westminster Assembly marking the transition in Richard Mullerâs periodization).",1560,1620,1527,1122,Wesley Viner,40,Stephen Christopher,2022-04-17 15:18:28.828 +0200,2022-04-17 15:18:28.828 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),1.194756298736411e-15,3.0013659750280754e-14,0.030097498065606434,5.420957844409647e-13,0.005705333449666377,3.0775466108864415e-35,1.9259450670037502e-05,5.347766256705327e-23,0.9641779090334839
1375,Epic of Gilgamesh,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Epic of Gilgamesh is a Babylonian narrative poem that recounts the adventures of the eponymous King Gilgamesh, the legendary ruler of the city state of Uruk. Stories about Gilgamesh were told from at least the 21st century BCE to the second century CE in a variety of formats, including a Sumerian cycle of poems, an epic poem in Akkadian, prose versions in Hittite and Hurrian, and visual depictions, not to mention oral retellings that have not survived in the archeological record.

The Babylonian epic developed continuously from the early second to the early first millennium BCE. Scholars recognize three main phases: an Old Babylonian epic that is imperfectly preserved; a Middle Babylonian phase of revision and experimentation; and an edited version in the Standard Babylonian language, composed around the 11th century BCE. The latter version, consisting of twelve Tablets (the twelfth of which forms an appendix to the main narrative of the first eleven), is the best-preserved and best-known account of Gilgamesh's story.

The epic can be divided into two parts, the first of which tells of Gilgamesh's love and triumphs, the second of his loss and failures. Gilgamesh is a restless, tyrannic king in Uruk, and the gods send the wild man Enkidu to befriend and distract him. The two become close friends, possibly lovers, and set off on a series of heroic adventures, killing the monster Humbaba and the Bull of Heaven. But halfway through the epic, Enkidu dies, and the second half of the story relates Gilgamesh's profound grief and his ultimately futile attempt to achieve immortality.",-1900,-130,1531,1129,Sophus Helle,50,Andrew Danielson,2022-04-18 03:31:47.878 +0200,2022-04-18 19:13:58.614 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),2.4850706961101983e-13,1.66892040737946e-20,1.7704830030591099e-13,4.83320778009648e-14,2.4366991578652852e-24,1.6906825810312714e-24,0.999999999999526,3.760996762554123e-20,2.5560473880660197e-20
1376,African Initiated Churches,43,Religious Group (v6),"African Initiated Churches, otherwise also known as African Independent Churches and Pentecostal-Charismatic Churches (see Birgit Meyer) denotes a group of religious individuals brought together by the need to appropriate Christianity with traditional African belief systems. The term 'African Initiated Churches' thus categorises clusters of religious groupings formally termed the Zionist, Ethiopian and Messianic Churches. 

Since Christianity is expanding rapidly in Africa, recent theorists suggest that the threefold categorisation fails to capture the complexity and vibrancy of said religious groups; distinguishing rather between followers of the 'Book' and the 'Word' (see M Nel). For this entry, we focus primarily on the Zion Christian Church (ZCC) in South Africa. 

The group derives its name and theological bent from a variety of sources. Historically, the Scottish-Australian minister John Alexander Dowie who went to America and started the city of Zion movement which emphasised healing had a great influence on the formation of the Zionist churches in Africa. For example, Dowie exerted significant influence over the local South African Dutch Reformed missionary, Pieter L Le Roux, who became increasingly interested in the matter of healing after reading Dowie's works and coming across localised testimonies of healing. After resigning from the Dutch Reformed Church (DRC), Le Roux started a church for all members in South Africa which included Zulu speaking individuals. As M Nel writes, 'Le Roux's Zionist group was characterised by their accommodation to indigenous habits and beliefs. The worship was lively and loud and the clothing colourful' (See Nel, p. 206). Le Roux is thus credited with starting the Zionist movement in South Africa. 

A Biblical thematic central to both Dowie and Le Roux was the concept of the cultic centre (see Kelebogile Resane). In Hebrew Scriptures the Mount of Zion represented a centralised place of congregation and worship of God. In many respects it also represented the promises of Yahweh to the Jewish nation. Since Mount Zion also served as a place of ritual and worship, life itself was centred around the holy place. Zion City in Moria, Limpopo, has come to denote a similarly theologically significant place for the believers within the ZCC.

The ZCC and its African initiated affiliates were long overlooked in religious and theological inquiry because the emphasis on faith healing and the appreciation of African traditional practices was regarded as functioning outside of the theological. As a result religious phenomenon was relegated to the sociological and anthropological. Recent theological inquiry shows, however, a great wealth of knowledge that is just beginning to be uncovered by modern day scholars. 

Due to the fact that the ZCC and its annual meetings, in particular, are kept private and rarely opened to media, the information at researchers' disposal is scant.",1900,2022,1529,1153,Rozelle Bosch,40,Stephen Christopher,2022-04-18 13:02:12.417 +0200,2022-04-30 05:24:17.400 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.0005253782728738567,0.15319856738642224,4.438220079999047e-14,0.837878407502378,3.375990565325638e-15,5.006695243558654e-23,1.5664028450299384e-14,0.008296305121367299,0.00010134171689529293
1387,Spring and Autumn annals of Master LuÌ,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"A late Warring States text commissioned by LÃ¼ Buwei åä¸é. According to his biography in Sima Qianâs å¸é¦¬é·Records of the Historian å²è¨, LÃ¼ was a wealthy merchant in his home state of Wei è¡ when he met the Qin ç§¦ prince Zichu å­æ¥, who was held as a political hostage in the northern state of Zhao è¶. When the prince ascended to the throne in 249 BCE, he appointed LÃ¼ as assistant chancellor. When the king died two years later, his young son Ying Zheng å¬´æ¿, who succeeded him, appointed LÃ¼ as Prime Minister and Regent to the throne, a position that he held between 247 and 235 BCE. During his tenure, LÃ¼ assembled a group of retainers and visiting scholars in the Qin capital and commissioned them to create a comprehensive encyclopedic account of worldly knowledge to be used as a handbook for rulership. Often categorized as a miscellaneous é text by later bibliographers, the text includes material associated with Confucian å, Mohist å¢¨, Daoist é, and Legalist æ³ and other philosophical schools of thought. While it is not associated with any specific religious tradition or institution, the text contains a detailed blueprint for an orderly and harmonious state governed by the ruler, known as the Son of Heaven å¤©å­, in concordance with cosmic principles and natural cycles. The text includes 26 books and can be divided into three volumes: the Twelve Chronicles or Almanacs åäºç´, the Eight Examinations è¦§, and the Six Discourses è«. The first volume, organized according to the twelve months of the year, provides a detailed ritual calendar for a state religion headed by the Son of Heaven, whose performance of seasonal sacrifices is integral for the wellbeing of the state, its human subjects, and the natural world around it. These rituals include the Plowing Ceremony to mark the beginning of the agricultural year, the Sericulture Ceremony led by the Queen and her retinue, the Grand Exorcism performed at the end of winter to expel all of the previous yearâs misfortunes. The text is said to have played an influential role in the education of the young king, who eventually unified China and assumed the title the First Emperor of Qin ç§¦å§çå¸. While the religious vision described in the text was never fully implemented, especially after the rather swift demise of the Qin Empire, it is believed to have served as an inspiration for the imperial religion developed during the Han Dynasty and practiced, in some form or another, until 1911.",-247,-239,1546,1100,Ori Tavor,45,Matthew Hamm,2022-05-06 19:04:19.759 +0200,2022-05-14 22:54:31.198 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),9.634505588441003e-23,1.807873120312851e-44,0.9999999999999324,2.686746134551041e-14,2.2516780247084612e-14,4.57050586789055e-37,1.821440655616122e-14,7.126328470105743e-38,5.840261380388999e-20
1389,Writ of the Three Sovereigns,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Writ of the Three Sovereigns was originally a key source of local Southern Jiangnan lore in China during the early medieval period. Dated to around the third century, it collected esoteric techniques that can be traced back to the âmasters of methodsâ (fangshi), regional ritual specialists and influential court advisors from third century BCE to the third century CE. The scripture was thought to have been revealed in Antiquity by high gods to the first three rulers of China, the legendary Three Sovereigns, in order to assist them in ordering the realm and attaining the powers that came with spiritual accomplishment. 

The bulk of the text is devoted to a series of potent talismans written in a celestial script that is indecipherable to common mortals. When deployed correctly, they can summon supernatural beings ranging from local deities to high-ranking gods so that practitioners can obtain their favor, their protection, or, more commonly, to inquire about future events. The practice has a visualization component since the divine beings manifest in the mindâs eye; accordingly, some scholars term it âvisionary divination.â 

Other techniques that are associated with the scripture include a meditation method that involves generating a bodily god that is a perfect embryonic version of oneself (an enchymoma) and alchemical practices that consist of crafting medicines and elixirs.

In the fifth and sixth centuries CE, the Writ of the Three Sovereigns became the centerpiece of one of the three core divisions of the nascent Daoist canon. As a result, it also became one of the foundational sources of early institutional Daoism. This propelled the text from the fairly self-contained context of local Jiangnan lore to a far broader empire-wide setting. The purported efficacy of its summoning techniques, through which, it was rumored, that deities could grant even the status of emperor or empress to practitioners, were quickly identified as potentially seditious by Tang imperial authorities. The scripture was summarily banned in 648 CE. All known copies were collected and destroyed in the capital. The text was replaced in the Daoist canon by the Scripture of the Way and Virtue (Daode jing). Nevertheless, some fragments survived in citations or manuscripts, enough that the Writ of the Three Sovereigns could be reconstructed, at least in part, by contemporary scholars.

After the ban, during the Song dynasty (960â1279), the scripture was ârediscoveredâ as a result of renewed interest in its practices. A highly modified version, in actuality an antiquarian reconstruction, circulated around the tenth century, enjoying significant popularity among Daoists for a few centuries. Its tenets and methods spread throughout China once again. Later on, during the late medieval or early modern periods, the Writ of the Three Sovereigns reached as far as Japan.",200,1200,1544,1160,Dominic Steavu,45,Matthew Hamm,2022-05-11 21:07:49.084 +0200,2022-08-08 22:04:45.350 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),6.100057201199388e-15,1.8317195766457287e-22,0.9999999999988236,1.8535772224701213e-14,1.1439674743076557e-12,2.8324086750000038e-36,7.804827965044009e-15,1.6918952882651922e-26,7.48036244988906e-19
1390,Eastern Apache,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Central Band of the Eastern Apache are a Native American group residing in what is now New Mexico. This entry focuses on ethnographic evidence that reconstructs Eastern Apache life and beliefs in 1870, prior to the reservation era, at which time the Eastern Apache occupied territory west of the Rio Grande in what is now southern Arizona and New Mexico. The second half of the 19th century was marked by violent conflict between the United States government and the Eastern Apache, which ended in 1886 with the surrender of the Eastern Apache chief, Geronimo, to United States forces. Following his surrender, the Eastern Apache people were considered prisoners of war and imprisoned first in Florida, then in Alabama, and lastly, in Oklahoma. The combination of violence, imprisonment, and forced migration resulted in severe population loss among the Eastern Apache. In 1913, most of the Eastern Apache were again transferred, this time to the Mescalero Reservation in New Mexico (Beierle, 2012:2). In 1870, the Eastern Apache lived in autonomous settlements that engaged in warlike raids of both external societies and other Eastern Apache communities. Eastern Apache religion centered around the personal relationship that each individual had with a supernatural, animating principle known as âthe power.â Those with especially strong relationships with the power were known as shamans. Power was believed to come from different supernatural sources, including one of many supernatural beings, and could be used for multiple reasons, from curing to cursing people. For the Eastern Apache, religious beliefs were inseparable from almost all aspects of social and political life. Therefore, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society at large.",1855,1880,1545,1090,Anj Droe,1,M.

1392,Messalians,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Messalians or Euchites was a Christian heresy originated in Mesopotamia around 360-370 CE and existed to about the ninth century. Their teachings spread into Syria and Asia Minor and later to Thrace. The name âMessalianâ comes from the Syriac má¹£allyÄnÄ, meaning âthe person who praysâ. The name euchitÄs comes from the Greek translation of the Oriental name and means the same. The first references to Messalianism appear in the 370's in Ephrem the Syrianâs âContra haeresesâ, in Epiphaniusâs âPanarionâ and âAncoratusâ, and later in Jerome, Atticus and Sisinnius, Archbishops of Constantinople and Theodotus of Antioch. The term âMessalianismâ in fact does not refer to a specific group of people, but it was applied in a pejorative manner to any group of ascetics or monks who seemed to reject the sacramental ordinances of the Church, or who placed an emphasis on empirical aspects of prayer and demonstrated doctrinal and behavioural deviations from orthodox monastic norms. Messalians therefore were ascetics who practiced poverty, celibacy, and fasting, rejected the sacramental life of the Church and claimed that they were able to see God with their physical eyes. Messalianism was first condemned as a heresy at the Synod of Side (Pamphylia) in 388 or 390. They were finally anathematized by the Third Ecumenical Council of Ephesus in 431. Messalianism and Messalian tendencies continued to exist for several centuries, influencing the Bogomils of Bulgaria and, thereby, the Bosnian Church, and Catharism. By the 12th century Messalianism had reached Bohemia and Germany and, by a resolution of the Council of Trier in 1231, was condemned as heretical. Messalians held that the essence of the Holy Trinity could be perceived by the  senses. That the Threefold God transformed himself into a single substance to unite with the souls of the perfect and that has taken different forms in order to reveal himself to the senses. Only such sensible revelations of God confer perfection upon the Christian. They also taught that, once someone experienced the essence of God, he was freed from moral obligations or ecclesiastical discipline. They had male and female teachers, the ""perfecti"", whom they honored more than the clergy.",360,900,1549,1170,Lampros Alexopoulos,49,Ian Randall,2022-05-14 11:32:39.527 +0200,2022-05-18 07:48:16.614 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.010026507311240159,1.0538051657151942e-11,0.009890033983782836,0.10842735698912397,0.008201477049084747,3.1075927741502137e-13,1.8350434473165943e-05,0.11227868560596335,0.751157588615483
1393,The Ladder of Divine Ascent,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The âLadder of Divine Ascentâ is an ascetical treatise written by John of the Ladder (also called Scholasticus or Sinaites-of Sinai). John (579-650) received a general education and at the age of 16 he took monastic vows, lived as an anchorite at the foot of Mount Sinai and eventually became abbot of the monastery of St. Catherine of Sinai. The text is addressed to John, abbot of the Monastery of Raithou, who requested a text specifically for the spiritual benefit of the monks of his monastery. The treatise was inspired by the Biblical account of Jacobâs Ladder (Gen. 28:10 ff). The treatise consists of thirty chapters that represent the rungs of a ladder reaching from earth to heaven. The number thirty is symbolic of the thirty years of the âhidden lifeâ of Jesus Christ. The idea behind this symbolism is that the monk, through his gradual spiritual ascension, may become a perfect man in the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. The titles of the thirty rungs-chapters of the divine ladder are named after the virtues that a monk must pursue and cultivate, and the vices that must be banished. The distinctive feature of the treatise, which is actually the cause for its special popularity, is the particularly graphic concept of the Ladder, offering thus to the fervent monk-reader a means of ascent to heaven. The imagery of the Ladder to heaven is not a Christian invention. It operated as an allegory for spiritual development long before Christianity. Johnâs contribution lies on the transformation of an imagery of a rather vague allegory of spiritual progress into a practical -so to speak- spiritual exercise, by identifying each step of a monkâs effort with a particular and positive achievement. Hence, with the exception of the Scriptures and the liturgical books, no other text in Eastern Christendom has been studied, copied and translated to the same extent as the âLadder of Divine Ascentâ. It was the most widely used handbook of the ascetic life in the ancient Greek Church and became very popular among monks and laymen in both East and West. It spread across the Byzantine Empire and affected Christian spiritual leaders such as Theodore the Studite, Symeon the New Theologian, Nicetas Stethatus, the Hesychastic movement, while it was pivotal in the fifteenth-century monastic revival in Russia. In the West, the treatise enjoyed popularity especially among Franciscans, Benedictines, Cistercians, the monks of Chartreuse, who also wrote commentaries on it, and to a lesser degree among Jesuits. The text was translated in Arabic and Georgian before the tenth century, into Romanian by the early seventeenth century. A Latin translation, albeit fragmentary, appeared at least as early as the eleventh century. The first Italian translation was made in 1474. The text also appeared in Portuguese in the fourteenth century, in Spanish in 1504, in French in 1603, and in German in 1834. Furthermore, among the first books printed in America was a Spanish edition of the ""Ascent of the Divine Ladder"", published in Mexico during the sixteenth century. The first English translation appeared as late as 1858.",579,650,1550,1170,Lampros Alexopoulos,49,Ian Randall,2022-05-16 19:10:45.400 +0200,2022-05-20 11:31:22.163 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),8.280394038991037e-07,0.0017336926330442,0.0015727088354982471,0.01789957865863001,0.014150313706482204,5.765102672562781e-24,7.359399894244026e-07,4.112795993141033e-12,0.9646421421828393

1399,Religion in the Mittani Empire,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Mittani people were composed of a Late Bronze Age Hurrian-speaking set of communities, situated in the region around the Euphrates river between modern-day Aleppo, Erbil and DiyarbakÄ±r. At its peak in the 14th century BCE, the Mittani Empire or state would have included at least AÅ¡Å¡ur, Alalaá¸«, Arrapá¸«a, Kizzuwatna, Tunip, and probably Yamá¸«ad and á¸ªana. These were semi-independent, and sometimes ruled by their own Kings under the overlordship of Mittani with models of governance probably adapted on a case-by-case basis. 

This region has been difficult to access in recent times, which means that many potentially Mittani sites remain unexcavated and much about Mittani is still unknown. To complicate matters further, in the past data about Mittani and Assyria were often added together, and to date no large (royal) Mittani archive has been identified. A huge number of mostly economic documents is available from Nuzi, which was part of the Mittani vasal state of Arrapá¸«a â but it should not be assumed that any religious practices we can discern from these for Nuzi would reflect those of the entire Mittani Empire. There is only a handful of published cuneiform tablets that can be said with certainty to have been Mittani. The biggest source of information is perhaps the Mittani series of Amarna letters, and Mittani is also frequently mentioned in other contemporary letters and treaties, e.g. by the Assyrians and Hittites. Also significant are the so-called 'Assyro-Mittani' tablets found at BoÄazkÃ¶y, which describe witchcraft and rituals. It is usually unclear however who wrote these, when, and where â and as with Nuzi, it should not be assumed that the practices described in these texts would have consistently applied across the entire Mittani Empire.

While it is likely that the Mittani people would have primarily identified as Hurrian, not all Hurrians were Mittani. In addition, the Hurrians did not necessarily have homogenous theology, mythology, cults or rituals nor did they have a name for their religion â and as such should not be understood as a religious group. With that said â many people likely believed in a particular array of named deities, and held a related collection of beliefs with associated institutions and practices. For instance, Hurrian texts refer to an idea of heaven, earth and the underworld. The most significant Hurrian deity was the weather god TeÅ¡Å¡ub. He would have yielded storm, rain, and lighting, and travelled the skies in a chariot drawn by bulls. He was joined by the goddess of love and war, Å auska, who would have played an important role e.g. blessing marriages. There were likely also a sun and mood god, Å imike and KuÅ¡uh, linked to different omens and oaths; and of course many deities, such as Nergal and Ea, borrowed from other traditions. Deities were anthropomorphic and they were given offerings. Rituals, festivals, divination and incantation all played important roles in society, and cities had temples dedicated to deities. Many more details are available about Hurrian religious beliefs, but not necessarily from Mittani sources or the Mittani period.",-1550,-1350,1554,1171,Zenobia Homan,50,Andrew Danielson,2022-05-23 13:07:24.235 +0200,2024-06-05 22:00:14.955 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.07865291605590509,7.331148417091953e-10,0.023796721694271335,0.015251244015041104,8.361361756741332e-14,1.6557487523092754e-13,0.8818602552385723,0.00043885726443908767,4.998407160431663e-09
1401,"The ""On the Divine Names"" of Pseudo Denys the Areopagite",52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The treatise âOn the Divine Namesâ is written by Pseudo Denys (Dionysius) the Areopagite. The treatise extends to thirteen chapters which, when completed, leaves the reader intrigued and fascinated from the beautiful âspectaclesâ it contains: the infinite manifestation of God's providence; the silent reconciling effect of divine peace; the connecting power of divine eros; the undisputed dominance of the good that pervades everything; the unity of everything in the absolute one, God. Its author presents himself as Dionysius the Areopagite, originally a member of the Athenian judicial council (known as âthe Areopagusâ) in the 1st century C.E. who was converted by Paul and became his disciple (mentioned in âActsâ 17:34). For this reason, Dionysiusâs writings retained the status of apostolic authority until the 19th century, when studies proved that the author was deeply influenced by the Athenian Neoplatonic school of Proclus. Hence, the treatise was written in the time of Proclus (ca. 500, since Proclus died in 485 CE and since Severus of Antioch explicitly cites Dionysiusâs writings between the years 518-528) by one of his pupils, perhaps of Syrian origin, who knew enough of Platonism and the Christian tradition. The treatise is Dionysiusâs longest work. It consists of thirteen chapters and deals with affirmative theology, namely, the names attributed to God in the Scripture. It furthermore explores the limits and the capacities of human language, also involving negative theology. Dionysius deals particularly with the distinction into the multiple attributes of the godhead as a whole. Although the names applied to the godhead refer to it as a unity, each name however is different and it therefore differentiates the godhead. Dionysiusâs use of the prefix âover-â indicates the self-multiplication of the godhead, while the use of the prefix âpre-â indicates that God has the attributes of creatures in such a way that he transcends both creature and attribute. The so-called âCorpus Areopagiticumâ became extremely popular in the Latin West when the Byzantine emperor Michael II the Stammerer (770-829) sent a copy as a gift to king Louis the Pious in 827. The first translation, made in 838 by the abbot Hilduin of the monastery of Saint Denys near Paris, was so incomprehensible that Charles II the Bald asked John Scottus Eriugena to make a new translation, completed in 862 and revised in 875. The influence of Dionysius in Eriugenaâs thought is profound. Dionysiusâs writings also had a profound effect in the Franciscan tradition, especially in Robert Grosseteste and Bonaventure. Dionysiusâs ideas pervade not only the Italian and English Renaissance, but also the German mystical writers (Mystique rhÃ©nane; RheinlÃ¤ndische Mystik), such as Meister Eckhart, Jean Tauler, John van Ruysbroeck, Jean Charlier de Gerson, not to mention Nicholas of Cusa and the Spanish mystics, such as St. John of the Cross.",485,528,1556,1170,Lampros Alexopoulos,49,Ian Randall,2022-05-23 17:39:11.639 +0200,2022-06-10 10:59:29.010 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),1.2258675343361217e-07,0.0015141782507217063,0.0006864485366076154,0.024348565054610454,0.001148970603636115,1.113231086316365e-24,2.3494184252716765e-07,1.6648332025890217e-12,0.9723014800241633
1404,Religion in Nabataea,43,Religious Group (v6),"Religion in Nabataea was a confluence of native and foreign deities and practices which spread across the Arabian desert. Ranging from the worship of betyl blocks to figural sculpture, sacred high places to Greco-Roman temples, priestly worship in sacred places to traveling pocket-sized 'eye-idols,' religious practice adapted readily to the many needs of its people and the cultural heterogeneity which permeated the region. While the concept of a âNabataean religionâ is inauthentic, a general understanding of the polytheistic religious practice within the area controlled by the Nabataean king can be reconstructed from material evidence and the few remaining literary sources. Aniconic blocks are the most common aspect of Nabataean worship, in Petra and throughout the region. These rectangular blocks, sometimes including eye stones or engravings called âeye-idols,â were often dedicated to the primary deities of Nabataean polytheism, specifically Dushara and al-Uzza. Ritual feasting was also an important aspect of religious tradition, as was common in other Near Eastern and Semitic religious groups. These feasts took place commonly in triclinia as part of sacrificial and funerary ceremonies. Sacrifices, perhaps of live animals, but more likely of clay figurines, were fundamental aspects of these ceremonies.

Egyptian, Persian, and Greco-Roman influences were clearly prominent in the art and architecture of main Nabataean cities, including figural depictions of deities which was unusual for the aniconic traditions of the Nabataeans. While foreign deities were often amalgamated with Nabataean deities, such as Dushara-Zeus-Dionysus and al-Uzza-Isis-Aphrodite Ourania, the syncretization remained largely in public urban spaces. In practice, religious traditions seem to have remained unchanged even with the on-going contact with foreigners. Few foreign influences have been found in private spaces, sacred high places, or rural areas. 

As Nabataeans spread into the Mediterranean, for political and economic purposes during the later part of the Hellenistic period, their worship of the high god Dushara traveled with them. Cultic sites and altars dedicated to Dushara have been found as far away as Puteoli, Italy. This is likely due to the strong connection between Nabataean kingship and Dushara. While the king played a role in religious practice, much still remains unknown about the roles of worshippers and the organization of religion in Nabataea due to the lack of written records by contemporary, Nabataean sources.",-300,450,1560,1188,Anna Accettola,50,Andrew Danielson,2022-05-28 18:47:59.563 +0200,2022-05-28 18:49:38.852 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.01102947306771977,0.344165977894305,0.2860116835220254,0.1761676491822661,0.05263749829599115,0.0031119405369363817,0.12613419976803572,0.0007413886859643206,1.8904675608999325e-07
1406,Barlaam and Ioasaph,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Barlaam and Ioasaph is the legend of two mythical saints, enjoying remarkable popularity in the literatures of Islam, Judaism, and Christianity. It exists in dozens of versions. The legend takes place sometime after apostle Thomas evangelized India. It narrates the story of the Indian prince, Ioasaph, son of the pagan king Abenner, a persecutor of the Christian Church. Ioasaph despite his fatherâs confinement to a palace for being isolated from contact with Christians, embraces the religion after being taught by monk Barlaam. Abenner troubled by his sonâs conversion engages in more severe acts of persecutions and makes several unsuccessful attempts to make Ioasaph recant his faith. As a last resort, he tries to seduce Ioasaph with power and glory by letting him reign over the half of his kingdom. The secular, yet holy life of his son inspires conversion to Abenner who lives his last days as ascetic. After the death of Abenner, Ioasaph reigns during few more years but he then renounces his kingdom. He wanders for years through wilderness and finally finds Barlaam. After their death, their relics revered as holy are moved to the capital of the Indian kingdom where numerous miracles are performed.
The story goes back to Indian legends about the life of Buddha, but it is impossible to establish a single source. From India, the legend emerged in the Arab-speaking world between 750 and 900 CE and was later translated before 900 CE into Georgian. This version was used by Euthymios the Athonite (â  1028), cofounder of the monastery of Iviron on Mount Athos, for the Byzantine Greek translation assumed to have been completed shortly thereafter 985 CE. By 1019 CE the Greek revised version of the text was also in circulation. The legend was popularised in the West via a Latin translation known as the âVulgateâ and was soon adapted into several vernacular versions. Some of them derive from the Latin âVulgateâ, while others were adapted from the thirteenth-century CE abbreviated version found in Jacobus de Voragineâs Legenda Aurea. The surviving witnesses of the different versions of the text that have come down to us are numerous. A small minority among them has received cycles of illustrations.
Barlaam and Ioasaph includes a set of allegorical stories (or apologues) woven into the narrative framework of the text. These apologues were disseminated independently from it and can be found in many well-known European literary works, such as collections of fables or short stories like the Disciplina clericalis and Bocaccioâs Decameron, plays like Shakespeareâs The merchant of Venice and many others. Depictions inspired by the apologues are another proof of the wide dissemination of these apologues, since they can be found in different religious and secular monuments throughout Europe.",750,1700,1571,1178,Marina Toumpouri,49,Ian Randall,2022-05-31 10:03:00.864 +0200,2022-06-06 05:21:30.125 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.004554659889402143,0.144039234057111,2.95086377222363e-14,0.7493558799167559,0.0005703402900662748,0.02989418327049593,0.05523161692468194,0.016354012181915442,7.346954190306902e-08

1415,Anomeans,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Anomoeans was a religious group of the 4th century that represented an extreme form of Arianism. Arius and his followers, who formed the heresy of Arianism, believed that the essential difference between God and Christ was that God had always existed, while Christ was created by God. The Anomeans distorted the phraseology of the Nicene Creed the âSon of God, the only begotten of the Fatherâ to mean that the Father as unbegotten and the Son being begotten made God the Father the source of the Son; therefore Father and Son are unalike (Î±Î½ÏÎ¼Î¿Î¹Î¿Î¹). Founder of the Anomoeans was AÃ«tius of Antioch, a man of lowly origins who worked as a vine-dresser, a goldsmith and a traveling doctor, until the year 350, when he was ordained a deacon by Leontius of Antioch. AÃ«tius held that God and Christ could not be alike. Since ingenerateness consists a crucial part of the essence of God, Christ could not be like God because he lacked this essential quality. The second leader of the Anomeans was Eunomius. This latter studied theology at Alexandria under AÃ«tius, and afterwards came under the influence of Eudoxius of Antioch, who ordained him deacon. He became Bishop of Cyzicus in 360. His works have been recovered from Basil of Caesareaâs and Gregory of Nyssaâs Contra Eunomium. Eunomiusâs principal belief was the ingenerateness (á¼Î³ÎµÎ½Î½Î·ÏÎ¯Î±) of God the Father. Being ingenerated, the Father could never come into contact or communicate His nature to generated beings. Therefore the Son is generatedÂ (Î³ÎµÎ½Î½Î·ÏÏÏ), created by the power of the Ingenerated Father. After his exposition of faith to emperor Theodosius in 383 Eunomius was sent into exile in Caesarea until his death in 394. His followers, condemned at the Council of Constantinople in 381, were called Anomoeans for they denied any substantial similarity between the Father and the Son. Since 398 several imperial edicts forbade the possession of his writings and holders of their copies were advised to burn them.",350,398,1573,1170,Lampros Alexopoulos,49,Ian Randall,2022-06-07 11:14:07.369 +0200,2022-06-08 18:51:30.356 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.0009971199981002614,0.00547493995736125,0.10021099354053543,0.23315692499001256,0.004709683772507454,4.4657141682604824e-24,0.015983259947248807,2.229680514865726e-12,0.6394670777920046
1418,Book of Jonah,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Book of Jonah is a text within the Hebrew Bible, specifically within the Book of the Twelve Minor Prophets, describing the prophet Jonah ben Amittai's journey to and experience in Nineveh. 

The text is preserved in Hebrew and in Greek, with some small differences between the texts. Major themes within the text include prophetic disobedience, true and false prophecy, Gentile piety, repentance, and divine freedom.

The content of the text consists of God commanding Jonah to go to Nineveh because the city's wickedness has come up before God. Jonah attempts to flee God's commission by taking a boat. God sends a storm upon the sea, and the sailors realise that Jonah is the cause. They eventually throw Jonah overboard, he is swallowed by a fish, and he prays to God. The fish vomits Jonah onto dry land and he goes to Nineveh and very briefly proclaims its overthrow. The people of Nineveh repent, and God spares the city. Jonah seems displeased that they are spared and has a conversation with God about the justification for his anger.

As a consequence, the pharaohs began to control significant wealth, which they largely bestowed on their gods, especially the theban god Amon (also knows as Amon-Ra given its fusion with the sun god Ra).

1420,Creek,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Creek (preferred name âMvskoke Creekâ) is a multiethnic Native American society composed of multiple tribes, the majority of which currently reside in Oklahoma, in the United States of America. This entry focuses on ethnographic evidence that reconstructs Creek life and beliefs in 1800, prior to the reservation era, at which time the Creek lived in what is now Georgia and eastern Alabama. Beginning in 1680 and continuing through 1830, the Creek formed and maintained a powerful coalition of four main tribes, known as the Creek Confederacy. As relations with the United States grew more strained following the Revolutionary War, the Creek Confederacy was forced to cede land and move to Indian Territory in Oklahoma in the 1830s. In 1898, the tribal governments were forced to dissolve. Most members of the Mvskoke Creek remain in Oklahoma today. In 1800, when the Creek Confederacy was still in power, contact with other cultures occurred primarily through warfare, or through missionary presence in the region. However, most of the Creek still practiced the traditional indigenous religion. While a supreme high god was present, Creek religion was primarily focused on a diverse assortment of non-human supernatural beings, many of whom took the form of animals. All sentient beings, as well as some inanimate objects (including geographical features) were believed to possess a spiritual soul, and a spiritual power was believed to be ubiquitous. This power was used by religious leaders for primarily healing and other medical purposes, so much so that medicine and religion were essentially inseparable. For the Creek, religious beliefs were inseparable from almost all aspects of social and political life.

1421,Tian wen å¤©å,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Tianwen å¤©å (âHeavenly questionsâ) is a long poem structured in a series of questions (wen å) directly asked to Heaven (tian å¤©) or concerning heavenly matters, included in the ancient poetry collection entitled Chuci æ¥è¾­ (âSongs of Chuâ, often translated into English as âSongs of the southâ). Alternative translation for the title Tian wen, besides âHeavenly questionsâ, are âAsking Heavenâ and âHeaven asksâ. The poem is attributed to the 4th century BCE Chu æ¥ state official and poet Qu Yuan å±å (340â278 BCE), yet his authorship of the poem as a whole is debated. The broad range of topics treated and their loose arrangement (possibly due to the mixing up of the slips in the original bamboo copy of the text) support the hypothesis of a collective authorship. Field advances the thesis that Qu Yuan, during one of his trips to Qi, collected diversified fragments circulating at the Ji Xia ç¨·ä¸ and put them together forming the Tian wen (Field 1986). Hinton suggests that Qu Yuan, in writing the Tian wen, might have drawn most of the material from ancient oral sources (Hinton 2009).
The Eastern Han æ±æ¼¢ (25 CE â 220 CE) poet and librarian Wang Yi çé¸ (fl. 130â140 CE), claiming to have based on Liu Xiangâs åå (79 CE - 8 CE) text, edited the first Chuci anthology with a commentary, the Chuci zhangju æ¥è¾­ç« å¥, transmitted in the received version, compiled in the 12th century CE, under the title Chuci buzhu æ¥è¾­è£æ³¨. Wang Yiâs edition of the Chuci is preserved in the received text, and comprises both a general foreword and several distinct introductions specific for each of the various works, in which he ascribes the Tianwen and other poems, such as the Li sao é¢é¨·, to Qu Yuan. Regarding Qu Yuanâs inspiration for the writing of the poem, Wang Yi refers to an anecdote that allegedly occurred during the author's exile, an episode that is generally considered not to be historically reliable: according to Wang Yiâs introduction (or rather, according to the source to which the commentator refers), the author would have been inspired by seeing murals depicting spirits, deities, landscapes, mythological characters, and more, painted on the walls of the Chu ancestral temple, and would have written these questions on the same walls (Chuci zhangju, Tianwen zhangju å¤©åç« å¥). Also in Sima Qianâs å¸é¦¬é· Shiji å²è¨ the Tian wen is ascribed to Qu Yuan.
Regarding its structure and content, the Tianwen lists circa 170 enigmatic and mysterious questions, which remain unanswered, directed to Heaven. It consists of about 370 tetrasyllabic lines arranged in around 90 quatrains, of which the even lines rhyme. On a general level, but there are various exceptions, two lines form a semantic unity, in which the first one introduces the topic, while the second one asks the actual question. In contradistinction to all the other poems attributed to Qu Yuan, in the Tian wen the nonce word xi å® is completely absent, fueling skepticism about his authorship of the work. The language is archaic as nowhere else in the Chuci, with the exception of few lines of the Li sao. The topics of the diverse lines are extremely varied and range from cosmogonic matters to the actions of divine and mythological beings and religious beliefs. The poem is traditionally divided into three sections, at least starting from the Tang dynasty å (618-907) times, that separate heavenly, earthly, and human matters (although different commentators divide the poem differently). The first section is concerned with cosmogonic myths and theories, cosmology, and celestial mechanics (e.g. the unaccountability of the origins of the world, the sun and moonâs celestial motion, the starsâ array, etc.); the second sectionâs focus is put on the asset of earth (e.g. the flood myth, the tilt between the sky and earth resulted from Kang Huiâs åº·å anger, Yiâs ç¾¿ shooting at the suns, etc.); the third and last section refers to the deeds and achievements of legendary characters and to human events (e.g. Yuâs ç¦¹ vicissitudes, the decline of the Xia å¤ dynasty, NÃ¼waâs å¥³å¨² myth, etc.). Of the questions asked, although for none is an answer offered in the text, some appear to possibly have a knowledgeable answer, while for others a sharp skepticism on the part of the author is evident. It is the case, for example, of the opening verses of the first section: 

éå¤ä¹åï¼èª°å³éä¹ï¼At the beginning of distant antiquity, who transmitted the account?
ä¸ä¸æªå½¢ï¼ä½ç±èä¹ï¼When above and below had not yet achieved form, how could it be examined?
å¥æ­ç¢æï¼èª°è½æ¥µä¹ï¼When darkness and brightness were confused and indiscernible, who could tell them apart? 

The poem is almost unique in his genre of listing unanswered questions. The only comparable literary work consisting of a list of riddles on a similar subject, yet considerably shorter, is found in the opening lines of chapter Tian yun å¤©é (âHeavenâs revolutionâ) of the Zhuangzi èå­.",-340,140,1272,1195,Francesca Puglia,45,Matthew Hamm,2022-06-17 16:19:14.606 +0200,2022-07-12 17:13:47.161 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.12285481850905443,0.07722526613680245,0.06482856533808462,0.11640746354576165,0.01076218443528214,0.01661358109282792,0.5882136546427061,0.0030944003542442296,6.594523638895959e-08
1422,Defense of Icon Veneration by John of Damascus,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The three treatises on the holy icons by St. John of Damascus were written during the first phase of the iconoclastic conflict, between the years 726 and 730-731 CE, on the occasion of the uproar caused in Byzantium after the issue of a decree by the emperor Leo III the Isaurian, which forbade the faithful to kneel in front of the holy icons and ordered that the icons should be hanged higher, so that it would not be possible to worship them. Despite the careful wording of the first decrees issued by emperor Leo, the rage of the iconoclasts against the holy icons did not take long to show its true face, as they were also opposed to the veneration of the Virgin Mary and the relics of the saints. Thus, iconoclasm took on explosive proportions and afflicted Byzantium and the Orthodox Church for more than 110 years. Among the reactions provoked by emperor Leo's measures against the holy icons were the intense theological debates, in which John of Damascus took part. John was a monk, priest, hymnographer, and apologist. He was born and raised in Damascus circa 675 to a prominent Damascene Christian Arab family. His father, Sarjun ibn Mansur, served as an official of the early Umayyad Caliphate. John was a savant, whose fields of interest and contribution included law, theology, philosophy, and music. He became a priest and monk at Mar Saba monastery near Jerusalem and undertook a spirited defence of the holy images in three separate treatises. The earliest among these works is his âApologetic Treatises against those Decrying the Holy Imagesâ. The purpose of this first treatise was not to defeat the rival iconoclasts, but to offer a helping hand to the truth. However, because the content of his treatise was not properly understood, John was motivated to write a second treatise shortly following a second decree issued by emperor Leo. John wrote a third treatise in late 730 or early 731, where he attempted a more systematic account of the teaching on the holy icons, the veneration of the Virgin Mary, the saints and the holy relics. According to Damascene, the iconoclastic notions that the miracles, passions and achievements of Christ and the saints are not allowed to be depicted, is nothing but an evil inspiration, as are all heresies. In the case of the holy icons, the devil envies man because, by honouring the holy icons he can see the image of Christ and be sanctified through Him. According to Damascene, the purpose for which the holy icons are made is to reveal and show things that refer to the invisible reality, for which direct and complete knowledge cannot be otherwise accessed. This is considered an aid for oneâs spiritual benefit and, ultimately, salvation. The concept of âholy iconâ includes inter alia the following types: the âphysicalâ image because the physical existence comes first and then the imitation follows. More specifically, and as far as the holy icons are concerned, the first natural and unchanging image of the invisible God is his Son, Jesus Christ, who revealed the Father through himself. Another kind of image is man, who was created in the image and likeness of God. In addition, there is the painted image, which represents shapes, forms and types of the invisible and incorporeal in a perceptible way, in order to obtain a vague idea of God and the angels, since it is impossible to perceive and understand the incorporeal without figures. There are also the icons that represent religious events, miracles or virtues in order to be preserved in the memory of the faithful and as a glorification for those who excelled in virtue. Damascene concludes that we worship only God creator, for the veneration given to the icon passes over to its prototype. Decades after John Damasceneâs death, presumably at Mar Saba monastery on 4 December 749, his writings would play an important role during the Second Council of Nicaea (787), which was convened in order to settle the icon dispute.",726,730,1579,1178,Marina Toumpouri,49,Ian Randall,2022-06-18 17:30:39.531 +0200,2022-06-21 18:14:30.799 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),6.625517772037345e-05,0.002885316368496511,0.002177672369807334,0.07500334501648785,0.004089281619199037,2.7521120682833537e-23,2.9014978961733533e-05,1.3680792512100092e-11,0.9157491144556463

In terms of the latter, it emphasizes the replacement of the corrupt and despicable Six Heavens (the cosmology of the Confucian ritual system) with the pure and eminent Three Heavens of the Dao, made up of the three qi: original, beginning, and primordial. The three qi also gave rise to Lord Lao, who then created his own mother, the Jade Maiden of Mystery and Wonder (Xuanmiao yunÃ¼) from cosmic energies, then orchestrated his own birth and life. At the end of the latter, he moreover ordered Yin Xi to become the Buddha and thereby deliver the pure Dao to the western barbarians. The text provides an integrated worldview and represents as justification of Celestial Mastersâ beliefs for the benefit of the Liu- Song court. The second juan deals more specifically with moral rules and theoretical doctrines, associated the Dao with nonaction and outlining details of zhai or purgations.

Speaking of Christianity in China, the early missionary period, compared with the later nineteenth century when both the Catholic and Protestant missionaries appeared, is usually defined as from the late sixteenth to the early eighteenth centuries. It was the time when the first most active Christian mission was developed in China. Then, during the European Reformation and overseas expansion, the Catholic missionary was the sole actor in evangelization financed both by the Church and states. The Society of Jesus was officially founded in 1540 and became a significant contributor to the China mission over the centuries. This religious order tied with Asia in the very beginning. Francis Xavier (1506-1552), the first generation of the Jesuits, embarked from Lisbon in 1541 under the auspice of the Portuguese court on behalf of the crownâs colony in India. Although Xavier only died on an island outside Macao, not yet set foot on Mainland China, the Padroado, the Portuguese royal supporting system of the Jesuit missionary, became the primary channel to initiate the Catholic missionary history in East Asia. The Italian Jesuit Matteo Ricci (1552-1610) was the most crucial figure in the inception of the Jesuit China mission, who arrived in Macao in 1582. Thenceforth until around 1724, when the Chinese Emperor officially prohibited the religion, this early missionary period of Christianity in China was well-known for its vigorous religious and cultural encounters and thought as the first and most fascinating cultural interaction between Europe and China. The Jesuit evangelization in Japan and China, starting with learning native languages and accommodating cultural elements to their preaching, was proposed by the Jesuit Visitor Alessandro Valignano (1539-1606). Ricci substantially realized this method of accommodation, to fully dress as a Chinese literatus and deeply engage in the Confucian/Mandarin atmosphere. Ricciâs most prominent and influential interpretation for the Chinese is to understand Christian God in the original Confucian classics, in which the supreme Shangdi ä¸å¸or tian å¤© (heaven) could be equivalently termed as Catholic Deus. Ricciâs return to the Chinese antiquity to conduct his religious adaptation to Chinese culture, standing in conflict with contemporary Neo-Confucianism, was an original way to invent an indigenous comprehension of Christianity. Ricciâs argument for early Chinese awareness of the Christian God was to appropriate ancient Chinese terms and imposed on it the Christian meaning of the highest Creator. Although the following controversy after Ricciâs death regarding this terminology abandoned them and preferably officiated the Tianzhu å¤©ä¸», the Lord of Heaven, as the newly coined Chinese term for God, we have considered this âConfucian Christianityâ as a highly original hybrid: a monotheist religion and a purist Confucian tradition. It is not merely a result of an ambitious cultural accommodation but also, from the perspective of religious history, one of the most significant characteristic products of the early missionary Christianity in China.
The second characteristic of this period could point to another outcome resulting from the intensive and interactive dialogues of the Jesuits and Chinese Mandarins. Tianxue å¤©å­¸, learning of Heaven, appeared as a new discipline in the intellectual landscape of Late-Ming China. It indicates the Jesuit evangelization through European sciences and knowledge, which were also expected, in the missionary view, to meet Chinese intellectual interests and political needs. The above two characteristics demonstrate the importance of Jesuit accommodation, and also which raised one of the most well-known debates for Christian evangelization during this period, the Chinese Rites Controversy. One of the central controversial issues was the Jesuit interpretation of the Chinese worship of ancestors as the civil and social meanings without conflict with Christian monotheism. Deriving both from the criticisms of other Catholic religious orders, also working in East Asia on a comparatively smaller scale than the Jesuits, and from those doubts inside the Society itself, the Controversy lasted over one century. The Roman Church issued the final rejection of the Jesuit accommodation in 1742.",1580,1740,1583,1197,Hui-Hung Chen,45,Matthew Hamm,2022-06-24 11:06:27.662 +0200,2022-07-22 11:47:54.357 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.03889908955680644,0.14850445386805372,7.569673686244473e-14,0.36147072294318183,0.009116687727388403,0.1922427369018251,0.20388866367238115,0.04587758461602675,6.07142608049594e-08
1427,The Chaldaean Oracles,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The âChaldaean Oraclesâ comprise a body of fragments, survived through quotes and commentary by Neoplatonic writers, of a lost text from Graeco-Roman antiquity. The text is supposed to consist of utterances coming directly from the gods themselves, as well as from the soul of Plato. Originally composed in Greek language, the text uses the poetic form of dactylic hexameters, which was the traditional metre that was used both for divine oracles and for epic poetry. The authorship of the âOraclesâ is a controversial issue. They are usually attributed to a father and son by the names of Julian the Chaldaean and Julian the Theurgist, who are believed to have lived during the reign of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius (161â180 CE), or perhaps that of Trajan (98â117 CE). The place of origin of the âOraclesâ remains unknown. The fact that the text is written in Greek makes it likely that it originates from the eastern part of the Roman Empire. The term âChaldeanâ attributed to the text goes back to antiquity: philosophers in the Platonic tradition venerated Chaldaea âa name that Greeks of the 4th century BCE and later used for Babylonâ as a source of religious enlightenment. The region had a wider reputation in Graeco-Roman antiquity as the home of astrology and other esoteric doctrines and practices, while it is possible, by the time of the composition of the text, that the term âChaldeanâ designated âmagicianâ or âpractitioner of mysterious artsâ. The content of the âChaldean Oraclesâ is abstruse, mystical and not necessarily self-consistent. It makes metaphysical claims about the structure of reality and refers to techniques of practical ritual magic. The âOraclesâ embrace the basic Platonic division between a higher spiritual realm (Intelligible World) and an inferior material realm (Sublunar World). Presiding over the Cosmos is a divine trinity: Father, Mind and Power. Beneath these divinities are to be found a variety of lesser spiritual beings. The âOraclesâ affirm that the divine realm is accessible to human beings. Through the use of meditation and magical ritual practices, the soul of the worshiper can ascend upwards from the world of matter to the world of spirit and can achieve communion with the divine. Neoplatonic philosophers, from Porphyry (c. 234âc. 305) to Damascius (480âc. 550), considered the âOraclesâ as authoritative revelatory literature, equal in importance only to the âTimaeusâ of Plato. Other ancient Neoplatonists who used the âOraclesâ in their writings include Plotinus, the Emperor Julian, Syrianus, Hermias, Hierocles, Simplicius, and Olympiodorus. The Byzantine monk and scholar Michael Psellus (1018-1078) made the âChaldean Oraclesâ a pillar of his philosophy. Îe wrote commentaries on the âOraclesâ, for the composition of which he drew from Proclus. Psellusâs commentaries profoundly shaped the way in which other Byzantine writers engaged with the âOraclesâ, including Michael Italicus (d. before 1157), Nicephorus Gregoras (c. 1292âc. 1360), Gregory Palamas (c. 1296â1359) and George Gemistos Plethon (c. 1355âc. 1450). The âChaldaean Oraclesâ entered Western European culture at the Renaissance and influenced Italian philosophers, such as Marsilio Ficino and Giovanni Pico della Mirandola. The first printed edition of the âChaldean Oraclesâ went on sale in Paris, in 1538, published by Ludovicus Tiletanus (Jean Loys de Thielt), and it was based on the work of Plethon. The esoteric use of the Oracles began to gather steam in the late eighteenth century. It has been suggested that they might have influenced Mozartâs opera âThe Magic Fluteâ (1791), while they formed part of the work of Thomas Taylor (1758â1835), the Platonic philosopher who was one of the first people in modern British history to embrace revived paganism as a philosophical and religious system.",100,199,1584,1170,Lampros Alexopoulos,49,Ian Randall,2022-06-25 15:50:27.248 +0200,2022-06-28 10:59:29.476 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),5.187932867702393e-28,6.330916139259393e-26,0.9772022256150327,0.022797774384965094,9.15686896788065e-25,2.6705055680886314e-47,9.341709917152933e-17,4.2256075450021226e-37,2.0969676395830754e-15
1429,Enheduana's Exaltation of Inana,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Exaltation of Inana is a hymnic and narrative poem attributed to Enheduana, the daughter of king Sargon of Akkad, who served as the high priestess of Nanna in the city of Ur. She appears as the narrator and protagonist of the poem, but because all manuscripts of the text date to five centuries after her lifetime, the attribution is uncertain. The poem details Enheduana's expulsion from the city of Ur following a revolt led by a man named Lugal-Ane. She prays to Nanna, the god she has served, but he does not answer; so she turns instead to Nanna's daughter Inana, the goddess of love, war, transformation, and paradox, aiming to recruit Inana to her cause and elevate her to the top of the Sumerian pantheon. Most of the poem is a passionate, metaphor-laden paean to the terrifying powers of Inana, culminating in a self-referential scene where Enheduana composes the text we have been reading in a night-time encounter with Inana - swaying and exalting the goddess, and thus saving herself.",-2300,1700,1586,1129,Sophus Helle,50,Andrew Danielson,2022-06-27 17:08:19.760 +0200,2022-06-27 17:08:19.761 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.007838499998975455,1.526303014549956e-09,0.0369727419778726,0.07120836022629191,5.300030696404174e-14,3.342117730486736e-13,0.8831305184460851,0.000849861700140957,1.6123943561091245e-08
1431,Elements of Theology,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Proclusâs âElements of Theologyâ is the most systematic exposition of Neoplatonic metaphysics, an academic text in a systematic form that connects Greco-Roman antiquity with the Christian Middle Ages. This text, in fact, like most of the Neoplatonic writings, having influenced Christian theology mainly through the strange figure of pseudo-Denys the Aeropagite, appeared in its entirety at the beginning of the early humanist renaissance, both in Byzantium as well as in Italy, although, like other Neoplatonic texts, it survived in Arab philosophy through commentaries. Its author, Proclus of Lycia, or Proclus the Successor, was one of the most influential philosophical commentators of antiquity and is regarded as the greatest Neoplatonic philosopher of the fifth century CE. The title âSuccessorâ  was given to the head of the School of Plato in Athens and signified that Proclus was the successor of his predecessor and also the latest successor of continuous Platonic scholarship going back to Plato, the founder of the Academy in Athens. In 430 or 431 CE, probably at the age of 19 or 20 years old, Proclus sailed from Alexandria to Athens. His teacher was Plutarch of Athens, who instructed Proclus on Aristotle's âDe Animaâ and Plato's Phaedo. After Plutarchâs death in 432 CE Proclus was under the guidance of Syrianus, the head of the Academy in Athens. He is also said to have been taught and initiated into Chaldaean wisdom by the fifth century Greek philosopher Asclepigenia, wife of Theagenes, and the daughter of Archiades and Plutarch of Athens. After Syrianusâs death, c. 437 CE Proclus became the head of the School of Plato in Athens. Proclus was a prolific writer of ancient Greek philosophy leaving behind extensive commentaries on Plato, Aristotle, Porphyry and Plotinus, books and treaties on Neoplatonic theology, epigrams and hymns. He set forth one of the most authentic and systematic expositions of Neoplatonism and his works represent the most complete statement of Platonism. Proclus stands at the end of ancient Greek philosophy and at the beginning of the philosophy of the Middle Ages. The importance of the âElements of Theologyâ, and what highlights the dynamics of both its spread and influence, is not the fact that it is a mere summary form of late Greco-Roman Neoplatonism, but it is the unity of the systematic form with the transitional content, which concerns concepts that broadly establish the way of philosophical meaning-making and living that we follow to this day. The unity of the systematic form with the conceptual content is an essential parameter of this text. The concepts involved in this ground-breaking text are the result of its systematic form. It is innovative because of this unity, as the tendency of the Neoplatonism of late Greco-Roman philosophy to produce systematic forms finds here its supreme expression, which decisively influenced the entire Western philosophy. The text is divided into two main sections. The first (propositions 1 to 112) presents successively the general metaphysical âoppositionsâ used by Neoplatonism: the one and the many, cause and effect, immovable, self-moving, and passively mobile, the transcendence and persistence, decay and continuity, progress and return, the concepts of âcausa suiâ and âcausatumâ, eternity and time, substance and thought, the whole and the part, active and passive possibility, end and infinity, being, life, and knowledge. The second section (sentences 113 to 211) explains, in the light of the above âoppositionsâ, the relations formed in each of the three great categories of spiritual being: the Gods or entities, the minds and souls, and the relations connecting each of these categories with the lower ranks of being. As far as the influence of the text is concerned, an Arabic adaptation of it was made in the 9th century, called the âKitÄb al-Äªá¸Äá¸¥ fÄ« al-khayr al-maá¸¥á¸â, which was falsely attributed to Aristotle. This work was in turn translated into Latin in the 12th century by Gerhard of Cremona under the name âLiber de causisâ, which became a standard part of the university curriculum in the 13th century. In Byzantium, the text was studied by Michael Psellos (11th century) and translated into Georgian by Psellosâs pupil Ioanne Petritsi, who also wrote a commentary on it. A christian refutation of the work was written by the bishop Nicolaus of Methone in the 12th century. William of Moerbeke's Latin translations of Proclus' works were not widely read in the Middle Ages, though in the 14th century a Latin commentary on the âElements of Theologyâ was written by Berthold of Moosburg. Dante (c.â1265-1321) probably drew upon the âLiber de causisâ for the Neoplatonic ideas in his âDivine Comedyâ.",412,485,1633,1170,Lampros Alexopoulos,49,Ian Randall,2022-06-29 16:44:09.269 +0200,2022-08-17 09:38:54.604 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),4.986326761232292e-41,4.057863915609709e-38,0.9999999999999456,5.3827900771499947e-14,2.5474937271290937e-26,2.514900579306039e-60,6.172228592123784e-19,3.937999862973342e-49,6.399410731430949e-16
1432,Preparation for the Gospel-Demonstration of the Gospel,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The âPraeparatio Evangelicaâ and the âDemonstratio Evangelicaâ of Eusebius of Caesarea are two parts of a single treatise that was apparently the most comprehensive apologetic and polemical work written in the early Christian era. The text attempts to prove the excellence of Christianity over every pagan religion and philosophy, on the one hand. On the other, it focuses on Christianity's relationship to Judaism as the fulfillment of biblical prophecies. The âPraeparatio Evangelicaâ consists of fifteen books which have been completely preserved, while the âDemonstratio Evangelicaâ comprised twenty, of which only the first ten have survived.  Both works are addressed to the same audience, that is, new Christians of Gentile origin, and curious, educated pagans willing to learn about Christianity. Christian apologists had to fight against the claim that Christianity was a danger to the state, a crime against the official cult and religion and even against the Emperor himself. They fought for their legal and moral right to exist. Emphasizing the superiority of Christian morality and decency over the corrupt and degenerate social mores of the pagans, Christian apologists leveled against them the very same accusations which the pagans had used against Christianity. The apologists sought to weaken anti-Christian bias and to underline the superiority of Christianity over other religions and cults. Their attempt explains the often repeated claim that the Christian faith played a major role in maintaining world order, the status of the Emperor and the integrity of state and society. According to the apologists, a rational defense of the faith was necessary for the establishment of the right of the Christians to exist. Along with their effort to expose the absurdity and corruption of pagan religion, mythology and social norms, the apologists offered proof that only Christianity possessed a true understanding of God and of the universe. In this sense, the âPraeparatio Evangelicaâ is a quite interesting work, not so much because of its polemical content, but because of the abundance of its citations from the now lost works of ancient authors. Eusebius studded the âPraeparatio Evangelicaâ with many fragments from historians and philosophers, which are nowhere else preserved. The âPraeparatio Evangelicaâ preserves Pyrrho's translation of the Buddhist three marks of existence, upon which Pyrrho based Pyrrhonism; the text also provides a summary of the writings of the Phoenician priest Sanchuniathon, of which the accuracy has been shown by the mythological accounts found on the Ugaritic tables; the account of Diodorus Siculus on the wondrous voyage of Euhemerus to the island of Panchaea, where Euhemerus purports to have found the true history of the gods; it preserves fragments from the writings of the neoplatonic philosopher Atticus. There are no quotes from comedy, tragedy, or lyric poetry, but there are references to all the works of Plato and to an extensive range of later philosophic works, largely from Middle Platonists from Philo to the late 2nd century, as well as several more fragments from now lost works. The author of the text, Eusebius of Caesarea, c. 260/265â339, also known as Eusebius Pamphilus, was historian of Christianity, exegete, and Christian polemicist. He became the bishop of Caesarea Maritima, were he was born, in the Roman province of Syria Palaestina in around 314. He composed the texts in question between 313 and 324 CE, as apologetic works for the practice of verbal confrontation with Greeks and Jews. He conceived his apologetic work with a threefold purpose: To shatter the foundations of pagan religion and philosophy; To demonstrate that the Hebrew religion and philosophy are superior in every way to pagan culture; And to explain how Christianity diverges from Judaism and is thereby superior. The first part of the text, the âPraeparatio Evangelicaâ attempts to prove the superiority of Christianity by criticizing pagan religion and philosophy. The second part, the âDemonstratio Evangelicaâ, was intended to prove the validity of Christianity and the Gospel as the fulfillment of ancient prophecies. This could happen only after the reader of pagan origin had received suitable âpreparationâ, that is, the preparation for the presentation-demonstration of the Gospel. Hence, the âPraeparatio Evangelicaâ treats subjects familiar to the educated pagan, such as religion, mythology, philosophy, cosmology, theology, and ethics. At the âDemonstratio Evangelicaâ Eusebius proceeds to deal with particular problems that Christian belief presented to the educated pagan, such as the Son of God or the Logos, the incarnation, virgin birth, passion, crucifixion and resurrection.",312,324,1591,1170,Lampros Alexopoulos,49,Ian Randall,2022-06-30 06:54:21.074 +0200,2022-08-02 17:40:32.006 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),2.8423395757227562e-05,0.0035746751833923497,0.003218991142949796,0.3226647312880769,0.006697885028575447,8.4576889704832e-13,2.3205578232250464e-05,3.919267598737978e-12,0.663792088378251
1434,Kuna,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Kuna, whose name for themselves is âTule,â are an indigenous Central American group living along the northern coast of Panama. Originally from the Gulf of UrabÃ¡ in present-day Colombia, the Kuna fled Spanish occupation in the 17th century and settled in what is now the DariÃ©n Province of Panama, eventually relocating to their current location on the San Blas Islands and northern coast. Through a combination of strategic alliances, negotiation, and rebellion, the Kuna have managed to maintain much of their cultural and political identity in the face of colonial pressure to assimilate. This entry focuses on ethnographic evidence collected during fieldwork with the Kuna shortly after 1925, when La RevoluciÃ³n Tule (the Kuna Revolution), in response to assimilation pressure, won the Kuna semi-autonomous status for their land. During this time, traditional Kuna religion was still practiced, although syncretism with Christianity, and in particular Protestantism, was present. Living a righteous life, so as to avoid angering the supreme high god Pab Dummat, was of central importance in Kuna religion. The righteous were rewarded in the afterlife and wrongdoers were punished. Considerable political and religious overlap appears to have been present both in community leaders and in ceremonies. For example, large religious singing or chanting ceremonies took place in the same community meeting houses used for political purposes. Because religious beliefs were inseparable from almost all aspects of social and political life, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society at large.",1912,1937,1589,1090,Anj Droe,1,M.

In 1870, despite centuries of contact with the Spanish, the Tehuelche had maintained their traditional religious beliefs and practices. The Tehuelche believed in both a high god, who had little to do with human affairs, and troublemaking supernatural beings that are also referred to as devils. Religious specialists, who had powers that gave them the ability to treat illnesses, predict the future, and prevent harassment by the devils, played an important role in everyday life.

1452,Soushen ji æç¥è¨,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Soushen ji æç¥è¨ (âAnnotations on searching for spiritsâ) is canonically considered to be the first example of the zhiguai xiaoshuo å¿æªå°èªª literary strand, which comprises novels or stories about extraordinary events, characterized by the presence of spirits, ghosts, and supernatural phenomena. The Soushen ji has been compiled during the first half of the IV century (more precisely, around the year 350) by Gan Bao å¹²å¯¶, writer and historiographer at the Jin æ court (265-420) during the reign of Emperor Yuan å. 
Since the Soushen ji is the first real anthology of passages on supernatural events that has come down to us, the first written records of numerous well-known Chinese legends, as well as the first descriptions of real and mythological characters that inspired later texts, can be traced to it. It not only influenced the later evolution of the zhiguai genre, but it also laid the foundation for the development of the later chuanqi å³å¥ (reports on extraordinary events) that developed during the Tang å dynasty (618 â 907).
As with most texts from ancient China, we do not possess the original edition of the text, but the work of later editors, and it is therefore impossible to determine precisely how the original text was structured. Regarding the contemporary audience's perception of the anomalous themes dealt with in the Soushen ji, not much is known, yet the affiliation to the zhiguai genre is undoubted, based on some peculiar characteristics of the text:
-	the title reflects the classic structure that usually characterizes anthologies on the subject: a verb indicating the research or narrative (sou æ), followed by a noun explicating the supernatural, spiritual or anomalous content (shen ç¥), and, at the end, a character indicating the collection of documents itself (ji è¨), since it consists of numerous independent pieces and not of a continuous and organic narrative;
-	the prose is classical but lightened by the insertion of non-essential grammatical particles that make it reminiscent of the spoken language, yet never trespassing into the vernacular; 
-	the narrative is focused on extraordinary events, juxtaposed against a context of everydayness and normality.
Regarding the dating of the work, the almost complete absence of references to Buddhism suggests that the collected stories are dated between the 2nd and 3rd centuries. 
Moreover, none of the dates or events mentioned are later than the year 323, so it can be assumed that all the events narrated are prior to that year. Yet, some interpolations on the text and the specification, through the insertion of the character Jin æ, of the affiliation of the various emperors and eras to that dynasty (unnecessary for a reader belonging to the same historical period) prove its redaction by a later editor. Some references to the Soushen ji found in immediately later works confirm a dating around the year 350. These texts are: the Shui jing zhu æ°´ ç¶ ä¸» (""Commentary on the Water Classics""), the Soushen hou ji æ ç¥ å¾ è¨ (""Subsequent Annotations on searching for spirits"") by Tao Qian é¶ æ½ and the Hou Han shu å¾ æ¼¢ æ¸ (""Book of the Posterior Han"") by Fan Ye è æ , whose thirteenth and fourteenth chapters find almost complete correspondence in the sixth chapter of the Soushen ji.
The intent behind the writing of the Soushen ji, clarified by Gan Bao himself in the preface to the work, goes far beyond entertainment and is historical-didactic, stimulated by the author's strong interest in proving the great power of supernatural forces in a rational and coherent way.
Thanks to the author's biography in the Jin shu æ æ¸ (""Book of the Jin""), we know the peculiar circumstances under which Gan Bao is said to have decided to start gathering the material for the drafting of the Soushen ji: some extraordinary events seem to have affected his family, namely at the death of his father and at the time of his brother's illness. Although the historicity of such events has not been proven, nor it is certain that such stories associated with Gan Bao's biography actually involved his family (and have not even been elaborated on after the author's death and associated with his name only later by historiographers), such facts are traditionally considered to be the prerequisite for the realization of the work.
The structure of the work is very simple, the excerpts are collected into chapters based on a thematic rather than chronological choice, and the literary finesse is less accurate when compared to later works pertaining to the same genre (e.g.: the Liaozhai zhiyi è é½ å¿ ç° written by Pu Songling è²æ¾é¾ in 1740). Moreover, unlike other later zhiguai or chuanqi works, it is not declared to be literary fiction: it is defined as a chronicle of extraordinary events, mostly gathered from older sources, and, to a lesser extent, also from contemporary events.
The bibliographical sources from which the author certainly drew are at least thirty-three and among the various titles, one can mention the Zuozhuan å·¦ å³, the Guoyu å èª, the Han shu æ¼¢æ¸, and, above all, the Yijing æç¶.
In the preface to the text, Gan Bao states that none of the facts narrated were invented by him. The repetition of some anecdotes, which unequivocally represent different versions of the same event or references to the same folkloric tradition, supports the author's assertion. Again in the preface, Gan Bao justifies the possible presence of errors or imprecisions due to eventual inaccuracies in the sources: this is a typical problem of historical and historiographical work in relation to the accuracy and truthfulness of the testimonies. This emphasizes Gan Bao's goal of discussing the supernatural through the tools of chronicle and historiography, to prove the veracity of such events to the skeptical contemporary public.
Based on Gan Baoâs biography in the Jin shu ææ¸, Gan Bao wrote a text in 30 chapters entitled Soushen ji, while the received text consists of 20 chapters. Scholars agree that the original work was lost in the early years of the Song å® dynasty (960 - 1279) and that the version consisting of 464 passages, divided into twenty chapters, is actually an accurate Ming-era reproduction, based on collections of passages from the periods of the Six Dynasties, the Tang, and Song Dynasties. It was Hu Yinglin è¡ æ éº (a Ming scholar, historian, poet, literary theorist, and owner of one of the most well-stocked libraries of the time) who recompiled the text based on various sources accessible to him. The oldest account of the Soushen ji in 20 chapters is part of the collection Bice Huihan ç§åå½æ¶µ (""Collection of Secret Volumes""), compiled by Hu Zhenheng è¡ éäº¨ and engraved on wood in 1603. The reduction in the number of chapters from 30 to 20 is presumed to be due to the gradual loss of passages during the various recompilations of the text.
None of the passages included in the collection are particularly long, the shortest being less than ten characters, while the longest does not exceed five hundred characters. The language used is the classical language (as for all tales of anomalies from the Chinese Middle Ages): although some of the material included was evidently taken from oral sources, in fact, the text was written to be read in the same way as historical texts. 
Some of the many themes that emerge in Soushen ji: hagiographic accounts of the lives and deeds of immortal beings; good and bad omens associated with pre-Han cosmology based on the interaction between yin and yang and the Wuxing äºè¡ (five phases); dozens of different types of spirits and demons; unusual and miraculous births; encounters with the death and resurrections; medical and magical prescriptions; accounts on metamorphoses, demonic possessions and exorcisms; strange animals with unusual powers.",100,350,103,1195,Francesca Puglia,45,Matthew Hamm,2022-07-15 20:34:20.679 +0200,2022-07-28 12:52:50.417 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.6191560220341497,6.154269768851023e-09,0.35151593376780343,0.028996506639782812,4.224851270420827e-13,3.87072213758975e-13,2.3533212469191627e-11,0.0003315313796514389,8.250588124416382e-19
1454,Hesychastic Controversy,43,Religious Group (v6),"The hesychast controversy which lasted for some two decades started as a theological dispute but evolved into a political matter, relating to the strife between the contenders of the Byzantine throne. Hesychasm was a method of monastic prayer and contemplation practiced in quietude, in âhesychiaâ in Greek, and thus the name hesychasm. The term designates the process of retiring inward by ceasing to register the senses, in order to achieve an experiential knowledge of God. The term âHesychasmâ was originally used in the 4th century to denote any kind of hermit or anchorite monk. Evagrius Ponticus or Evagrius the Solitary (345-399 AD), a disciple of Basil of Caesarea, was the first to systematize the various contemplative practices into a unified system of prayer. He explained what the act of praying is, and what its effect is on the individual. The goal of monasticism was not to proclaim the Kingdom of God through a particular kind of material existence but to attain the total disembodiment of the mind through prayer. Proper activity of the mind is to detach itself from the body so it can be united to God. Ps. Macarius (a conventional designation of the anonymous author of works falsely attributed to Macarius of Egypt, 300-391 AD) made Evagriusâs ideas more compatible with Orthodox teaching. He shifted the focus of contemplative prayer away from the mind and its detachment from the body and located the Incarnation as the focal point for contemplative prayer. According to Ps. Macarius, the presence of the incarnated God meant that God had become accessible through physical reality. By attaining what Ps. Macarius called âpurity of heart,â one can enter into the eschatological reality of Christâs presence in our mind, body, and spirit. This mystical method was centered around unceasing prayer that opened the monk to the way Christ was present in him. The monastic practices in question became a crucial subject of debate following the reaction towards the teachings of Barlaam of Calabria, or Barlaam of Seminara, who attacked them. Barlaam (1290-1348) was an Orthodox monk on Mount Athos. He was educated in the West, and he was a supporter of humanistic renaissance thinking. He was a faithful proponent of Orthodoxy. In the early 1330s, Barlaam met the monks of Mount Athos and doubted about their hesychastic method of prayer. The monks he met were poorly educated-if not completely illiterate and therefore unable to answer his questions about their practices. After this encounter, Barlaam insistent that their use of the human body in prayer and their direct experience of God was misguided and heretical. He wrote treatises condemning their practices, mocking the bodily positions involved during Hesychastic prayer. 
He rejected their claim to bodily awareness of the divine presence and their visions of the un-created light. He was concerned that these visions, if they were occurring, were not affecting the monks in ways he thought they should. The reaction to Barlaamâs opinions was headed mainly by the monk â and later bishop of Thessaloniki â Gregory Palamas (1296-1357/9), who became the main representative of hesychasm and the leader of the hesychast party. In 1341 Andronikos III Palaiologos summoned a Council which didnât reach a conclusion. Following the emperorâs death, a civil war broke out between John Kantakouzinos and the supporters of the underage heir John V, concerning his succession. Kantakouzenos supported Palamas but so did his opponents, Alexios Apokaukos and Anna of Savoy. The aristocrats supported Palamas largely due to their conservative and anti-Western tendencies as well as their links to the Orthodox monasteries. It was not until the triumph of Kantakouzenos in taking Constantinople in 1347 that the Palamists were able to achieve a lasting victory over the anti-Palamists. The Council of 1351, summoned by the usurper John VI Kantakouzinos (reg. 1347â1354), recognised hesychasm as an official doctrine of the Orthodox Church, remaining thus until today.",1337,1351,1612,1170,Lampros Alexopoulos,49,Ian Randall,2022-07-18 08:23:39.200 +0200,2022-07-27 19:00:52.804 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),9.533508070136415e-06,0.00244928157500046,0.0009238310899962638,0.0991634372685362,0.00032272324345404736,5.165171781620516e-24,9.002862226893092e-06,5.382514309491613e-12,0.8971221904473334
1458,Mbuti,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Mbuti are a traditionally hunting and gathering-based society located in the Ituri Forest of what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Mbuti are also typically divided by hunting method: some bands use archery for hunting, while others use a net-hunting method (Beierle, 1995:1). This entry focuses on the net-hunting Mbuti located near the village of Epulu in 1950. At this time, the region had been under Belgian control for over 70 years. However, most cultural contact occurred with the neighboring Bantu villages, many of whose traits (including language and circumcision) the Mbuti adopted. Mbuti religion centers around the relationship of the society to the forest, which is understood to be sacred and to protect the Mbuti. The deity worshiped by the Mbuti (referred to by many different names) is simultaneously benevolent and a god of death, and is, by some understandings, the forest itself. A ceremony called the molimo is undertaken at various crises, during which songs are sung and noise is made to âwake upâ the forest. Satani, tricky and clever spirits that were once people, are also important in Mbuti religion, and especially in the improvisatory legends (Beierle, 1995:5). For the Mbuti, religious beliefs were inseparable from almost all aspects of social life. Therefore, this entry considers the religious group to be coterminous with the society at large.",1935,1960,1615,1090,Anj Droe,1,M.

1466,Islamic modernists,43,Religious Group (v6),"""Islamic modernists"" (hereafter ""modernists"") can be described as thinkers who try to reinterpret or ""reform"" practices, institutions, norms, and foundational texts of Islam in line with what they understand to be the challenges of modernity. They are a capacious ""group"" active since roughly the start of the 19th century, working in a variety of settings within and outside of ""the Muslim world,"" especially in governments and educational centres, from traditional mosque-universities in the Middle East and North Africa to universities in Europe and North America. Historians argue that modernists were at their most prominent from the late 19th to the mid-20th century, in other words, during the most intensive period of colonialism in Africa and Asia. Subsequently, they lost much of their momentum and were increasingly peripheral in intellectual and political debates. Historians offer different explanations for the waning of the modernist project. For instance, Henri LauziÃ¨re (2016) argues that the need for unity in anti-colonial movements in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) provided a supportive context for modernism (he uses the Arabic term, ""al-islah al-mua'tadil,"" ""moderate reform""), which shifted towards a conservative, ""purist"" Salafism when activists and intellectuals drifted apart after independence. In his 2018 monograph, Islam in Pakistan, Muhammad Qasim Zaman links the weakness of modernists to their failure to establish a social base comparable to that of 'ulama' (Muslim scholars) and Islamists, and their tendency to ally themselves with authoritarian rulers. The mid-20th century historian Albert Hourani suggests that modernists ""opened the door to"" secularism. This was inadvertent, since the modernist goal was to steer a ""middle way"" between tradition and secularism, broadly defined. From another perspective, historians such as James McDougall explore the modernist investment in (secular) nationalism. To sum up this literature, it can be said that modernists gave way to both secularism and Islamism, the balance between these forces depending on place and time. Today, those who position themselves as successors of 19th and 20th century modernists include everyone from ""liberal"" and ""secular"" intellectuals to leaders of Islamist political parties. 

Scholarship on modernists addresses not only ""the Muslim world,"" but also areas such as Britain, Germany, Canada, and the United States, since some modernists have had careers at western universities. To indicate modernism's broad geography, the map with the present entry encompasses western Europe along with several representative universities in North America, specifically McGill University and the University of Chicago. These are among the key institutions highlighted in the 2021 book by Megan Brankley Abbas, Whose Islam? The Western University and Modern Islamic Thought in Indonesia.

The question of what to select as an ""end date"" for modernists is complex, partly because of the success of modernism at Euro-American universities. A case can be made for describing modernism as an ongoing movement, but I have selected 1980 to indicate the precariousness of modernists in the regions where they first emerged and on which their ambitions have focused, the MENA, South Asia, South-East Asia, Central Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa.",1800,1980,1624,1209,Julian Weideman,1,M.

1468,Eastern Christianity From Nicaea to Chalcedon,43,Religious Group (v6),"The main task of the Council of Nicaea (325) was, on the one hand, the unanimous condemnation of the Arian heresy by all members of the Council. On the one other, the unanimous acceptance of a common and binding theological basis for the restoration of the unity of the bishops of the East. The first was achieved after long synodical procedures and discussions between the various theological groups. The second was founded on the baptismal symbol of the Church of Caesarea in Palestine, which was significantly improved after theological objections, with the addition of clearly anti-Arian terms, and was accepted after the various interventions of the emperor Constantine. The Council of Nicaea was motivated by the Trinitarian debates caused by the views of Arius (256-336). The purpose of the council was to clarify the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity as completely as possible and to faithfully express the teaching of Scripture. Arius wished to make the relation of the Father to the Son comprehensible. He and his followers equated the limits of their understanding with the limits of reality: what they could not conceive, could not therefore be. They held that the Father and the Son were of similar substances, but Jesus did not share in the same divine substance of the Father, He was not fully divine in the same way as the Father. Furthermore, Arius denied both the personality and deity of the Spirit. He considered it to be an impersonal causal agent, definitely not divine, operating as the power by which God the Father worked in creation. Although Ariusâs views were condemned by the Synod of Alexandria in 321, the spread of Arianism made it clear that the Apostlesâ Creed was no longer sufficient to protect orthodoxy. The Council of Nicaea, however, did not put an end to the controversies, but only gave the parties a new rallying point, initiating a half century of theological turmoil that was marked by political interference and changing fortunes for Athanasius of Alexandria and his supporters (the Orthodox party) and Arianism. In 381, one hundred and fifty bishops met in Constantinople, at the Council summoned by the emperor Theodosius I, with the view to declare the faith of the Nicene Creed in its original form, as the sole legitimate religion in the empire, and to condemn all forms of Arianism. The controversy between the parties at Nicaea and Constantinople raged over the proper term to express the kind of substance that the Trinity shares. The debate focused on the terms homoiousios and homoousios. Though the words look very similar, both meaning âof the same substanceâ they were poles apart in what they conveyed about the nature of Jesus. The difference was whether the Son is of the same or a similar substance with the Father. The Orthodox party favored the term âhomoousiosâ, âof the same essence,â to describe the relation of the Son to the Father. This term identified the Son sharing the same essence with the Father as uncreated and essential in His existence. The Arian party preferred the term âhomoiousiosâ, âlike the Fatherâ or âof a like essence with the Father.â Christology hence was the main concern. At the request of the Archbishop of Constantinople Nestorius, Emperor Theodosius II called together all the major bishops of the Eastern and a few of the Western Roman Empire to meet at Pentecost of 431 in Ephesus, in an effort to resolve the Christological question. Nestorius, who had been trained in the theological tradition of the school of Antioch, was reluctant in calling the Virgin Mary âTheotokosâ (Mother of God) and preferred to speak of her as âChristotokosâ (mother of Jesus as the one united with the Logos). Nestoriusâs opponents accused him for detaching Christâs divinity and humanity into two persons existing in one body, thereby denying the reality of the Incarnation. Accusations against Nestorius had focused on the claim that he divided Christ and was affirming two Christs and two Sons, a man and God, by considering the union of man and God in Christ as merely an external union. One of the main opponents of Nestorius, besides Cyril, Patriarch of Alexandria (376-444 CE), was the influential monk Eutyches of Constantinople, whose opposition to the teachings of Nestorius led him to an equally extreme, although opposite view. He promoted an extreme Monophysite (i.e. one divine nature) teaching which denied that Christ is co-substantial with humankind. Eventually, Emperor Marcian and his wife Pulcheria summoned a Council which met at Chalcedon in 451. The Council of Chalcedon was directed at the Nestorian and Eutychean heresies, which, although concurred with the Nicene Creed, they however worked out the deity of Jesus Christ in false relation to His humanity. The error of Nestorius and his teaching was the failure to unite the two natures in one person. Each nature represented separate persons in some way possessed by the man Jesus. Eutyches and his teaching drew the opposite conclusion: the human nature was subsumed by the divine nature, producing thus a hybrid and unique kind of nature. The Council of Chalcedon affirmed the unity of Jesusâs person and the duality of His natures, as well as His identity with the divine substance and pointed to four principles for an accurate understanding of Jesus: deity, humanity, the unity of one person, and the distinction of the two natures. These define the boundaries of orthodoxy.",325,451,1626,1170,Lampros Alexopoulos,49,Ian Randall,2022-08-04 15:03:10.496 +0200,2022-08-09 15:50:34.750 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),7.801679409204327e-07,0.062130309585922625,0.19372607254888505,0.7308281261034127,1.0030911166206118e-13,1.9049345503530492e-23,9.287313090158375e-17,0.01017271975686829,0.0031419918368699295
1469,Huamachuco Religion,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Huamachuco area, located in the Peruvian Northern Highlands at about 3,000 meters above sea level, was approximately occupied since the Initial Period (2000 â 1000 BCE) by people practicing both camelid herding and mixed farming (e.g. tubers, maize, fruits, etcâ¦). The dispersed households of the Colpa phase (until 900 BCE) were followed by a three-tier settlement system during the Sausagocha phase (900-200 BCE). Even though some sites may have featured special structures with a ceremonial function, this area was not influenced by the pan Andean ChavÃ­n cult. The following Purpucala phase (200 BCE â 300 CE) may have been marked by a population increase, the possible emergence of elites, and an increase in warfare and interaction with the Cajamarca area and the CallejÃ³n de Huaylas. The first examples of monumental architecture (residential structures called circular galleries) also appeared during this phase. People kept growing and large, monumental sites spread during the later Early Huamachuco phase (300 â 600 CE), including the well-known ceremonial site of Marcahuamachuco. Sites with monumental architecture were close to each other, had different functions, and were likely part of the same settlement system. The complex composed of Cerro SazÃ³n and Cerro Tuscan may have been the political core of the settlement system. In the Amaru phase (600 â ca. 800 CE) the area was briefly influenced by the Wari state (Peruvian Central Highlands), especially at the shrine of Cerro Amaru, with no major impact on the settlement patterns. The unfinished site of Viracochapampa may represent an attempt by Cerro SazÃ³n/Tuscan elites to replace Marcahuamachuco as the main ceremonial center in the area. However, in the Late Huamachuco phase (ca. 800 â 1000 CE) the importance of Cerro SazÃ³n/Tuscan decreased, the monumentality of Marcahuamachuco kept growing, and the importance of the site reached its peak. During the Tuscan phase (1000 â 1470 CE), monumental construction stopped at Marcahuamachuco and two site clusters emerged, each one likely representing an independent polity. The Santa Barbara phase (1470 â 1532 CE) encompasses the Inka domination of Huamachuco, a time marked by profound social, political, and economic changes in this area. The modern town covers the Inka administrative center, and storage rooms ('qollqa') surrounded the settlement. While no written accounts are available about the sociopolitical organization and religious practices of the Huamachuco people, archaeological investigations and colonial documents provide us valuable information, especially about the late prehispanic phases. Niched halls, which were found at various sites including Marcahuamachuco and Viracochapampa, were key ceremonial buildings. These structures were roofed rectangular structures featuring niches along the walls and were built since the Early Huamachuco phase. Bones of ancestors were placed in the niches, and lineage-based feasts were celebrated in these buildings. Such celebrations highlighted the autonomy of the communities living in the area, and an ideology centered around the unity of community members eventually prevailed over the idea of an elite-dominated society expressed by the rich mausoleum (300 - 600 CE) found at the pilgrimage center of Cerro Amaru. The document (RelaciÃ³n) written by the Augustinian friars residing in Huamachuco around 1560 has shed light on myths, deities, rituals, and places considered sacred ('wak'as') by Huamachuco people, leading archaeologists to identify what was deemed the ancestral place of origin of this group (Cerro Huacate) and the oracular sanctuary (Cerro Icchal) dedicated to Catequil, the principal deity of Huamachuco.",300,1532,1627,1198,Amedeo Sghinolfi,54,Diana Moreiras,2022-08-05 18:57:24.743 +0200,2024-05-14 20:20:53.357 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.024878190986329086,0.017495037166726894,0.08649343681100231,1.1994088404562252e-08,0.01802867144647114,0.006344942408436175,0.8467597091868968,4.918784342981443e-14,4.0368951084626404e-18
1471,Book of Ezekiel,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The book of Ezekiel is one of the prophetic books (Neviâim) canonized in the Hebrew Bible. It is a text of 48 chapters associated with the sayings and actions of the priest-prophet Ezekiel. Ezekiel is identified as one of the Judean elites exiled by the Neo-Babylonian empire alongside King Jehoiachin of Judah in 597 BCE. The book is set during the period 593-571 BCE and largely reflects the viewpoint of this first group of Judean exiles, who were displaced before the destruction of the Jerusalem temple and additional Judean migrations in 587 BCE. The earliest text of the book of Ezekiel was composed in Hebrew and has been preserved in slightly differing versions: the Masoretic text and fragments from Qumran and Masada in Hebrew, and the Old Greek and an alternative version attested by Papyrus 967 in Greek. The existence of alternative Greek versions of the text indicates that redactional activity on the book of Ezekiel was still taking place at the time of the bookâs translation into Greek, probably during the second century BCE. This means that, although many aspects of the book (including its language) reflect its sixth century BCE setting, some parts of it can be attributed to editors from later periods. The text consists of different genres, including narratives about the prophet Ezekielâs call and sign acts; descriptions of his visions; oracles attributed to the god Yahweh addressed to Judeans in Babylonia and in Jerusalem; and a lengthy law code (chapters 40-48) describing the reconstruction of Yahwehâs temple and the activities that will take place in it. The book of Ezekielâs primary message is that the Babylonian exile and destruction of Jerusalem are Yahwehâs punishment for the Judeansâ wrongdoing, including their worship of other gods and other cultic transgressions; violent mistreatment of their fellow Judeans; and constantly shifting alliances between foreign nations. Hope for the future is only possible for the Judeans in exile, who have the chance to accept their punishment, continuing to identify as Yahwehâs people and anticipating the day when Yahweh will give them ânew hearts and a new spiritâ that will allow them (or their descendants) to finally be faithful to him.",-593,-100,1629,1214,Rosanne Liebermann,50,Andrew Danielson,2022-08-09 11:13:50.948 +0200,2022-08-09 11:29:07.301 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),3.366748485768237e-13,2.4039261744455557e-19,1.0062784692108859e-11,1.65232195055116e-11,5.086992185481024e-13,1.5048978287770575e-32,0.013335533178271687,3.944444533219039e-10,0.9866644663998524

The magazine ran between 1936 and 1955, producing nine full volumes along with a tenth volume serving as a comprehensive index for the entire print run. Among its notable contributors was Muhammad al-Tahir ibn Ê¿Ashur (ÙØ­ÙØ¯ Ø§ÙØ·Ø§ÙØ± Ø§Ø¨Ù Ø¹Ø§Ø´ÙØ±, whose name is usually transliterated following the French orthography as ""Mohamed Tahar Ben Achour""), 20th century Tunisia's leading reformist scholar. Ben Achour's typical contribution to the magazine was an article-length Qur'anic commentary (tafsir/ØªÙØ³ÙØ±). These articles provided a starting point for his magnum-opus, the thirty-volume Qur'anic commentary, Verification and Enlightenment (Ø§ÙØªØ­Ø±ÙØ± ÙØ§ÙÙØªÙÙØ±), published in 1970 near the end of his life (1879-1970). In addition to Ben Achour's works of exegesis, the Zaytuna Magazine also featured articles discussing, among other topics, the hadith, the shari'a, episodes from the histories of Islam and of Tunisia, and social and political questions related to life in a colonized society.

1525,Changsha Zidanku Chu bo shu é·æ²å­å½åº«æ¥å¸æ¸ 1 (Chu Silk Manuscript),52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Zidanku Silk Manuscript 1, also known as the Chu Silk Manuscript from Zidanku in Changsha (Changsha Zidanku Chu bo shu é·æ²å­å½åº«æ¥å¸æ¸), and commonly referred to as the Chu bo shu æ¥å¸æ¸ (Chu silk manuscript), is a silk manuscript (47 cm long and 38 cm wide) unearthed by robbers in 1942 from a Warring States tomb in Zidanku, southeast of the former city walls of Changsha. The tomb has been dated by archaeologists as having been closed around 300 BCE. The manuscript, which contains a brief cosmogonic account, is mainly concerned with astronomical and astrological content and is deemed to have been used in divination practice. The Chu bo shu has been buried together with at least two other silk manuscripts, and these three texts represent the only silk manuscripts from Warring States China that have been discovered to date. After having been stolen, the Chu bo shu has been first acquired by an art collector called Cai Jixiang è¡å­£è¥ (1897â1980). In 1945, he personally published the first examination of the manuscript. Subsequently, the manuscript has been transferred to the United States of America and is now stored at the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery in Washington, D.C. The most distinctive feature of this manuscript is that it consists of both text and illustrations. The central part of the silk cloth displays two main texts, that are arranged in opposite directions. These two central texts are surrounded by twelve zoomorphic figures pictured in the peripheral area of the cloth, each of which is accompanied by a brief text. Each figure (with its respective short text) corresponds to one of the twelve months of the year. The three months making up each season are oriented toward a particular direction and each side of the cloth represents a season. There are four colored trees, each drawn in one of the four angles of the cloth. Due to exposure to light, folds, and worn edges, the Chu bo shu is unreadable in several spots. Nevertheless, the division into three main sections is clearly noticeable. Each of the three sections is concerned with some aspects of the lunisolar calendar: the longer one in the central section of the cloth is focused on the year; the shorter one in the central section, with the seasons; the short captions which accompany the twelve figures ringed around the main texts, with the twelve months. The main interest of the author of the Chu bo shu seems to be to avoid catastrophic events by having the calendar used with proper respect and knowledge. The three sections of the Chu bo shu: - The short text: the main subjects of the inner short text are the seasons. This section displays cosmogonical mythologies dealing with gods and with the establishment of natural order, based on the proceeding of the sun, the moon, and the seasons. - The long text: the main subject of the inner long text is sui æ­² (year). This section focuses on the possibility of disrupting the established natural order accounted for in the seasons' section of the manuscript. The main concern is the danger subsequent to a possible disruption of this order and therefore the importance attached to the knowledge and the understanding of the year for the purpose of avoiding this risk. The knowledge of the year is based on the observation of the proceeding of the celestial bodies, and in particular of the sun and the moon. - The twelve short texts: twelve hemerological captions which accompany the same number of zoomorphic figures, understood as gods associated with the twelve months. Each of the twelve texts presents the name of the lunar month (or its spirit), followed by a two-character definition of its functions, and a brief paragraph in which it is stated whether certain actions are permissible or not in a given month, in the guise of the monthly ordinances that we find in the LÃ¼shi Chunqiu åæ°æ¥ç§. The longer text written in the center of the silk cloth is positioned with the three winter months on top, spring months on the right, summer months below, and autumn months on the left, with the shorter text (also written in the middle of the cloth) arranged upside-down on its side. The manuscriptâs layout suggests that it is purposely cardinally oriented and probably conceived in such a way to be rotated during its reading and use. The fact that the layout of the Chu bo shu requires its reader or user to rotate it (or to circle around it) suggests that it is related to divination practices. In fact, this mechanism of rotation, together with the concern with the motion of the celestial bodies and the flowing of time, is reminiscent of the function and the working of a divination object known as the shi å¼ (cosmograph or divinerâs board), in which a round disk (that represents the sky) rotates upon a square base (that represents the earth).",-400,-300,1688,1195,Francesca Puglia,45,Matthew Hamm,2022-09-30 19:01:22.518 +0200,2022-10-03 10:58:42.740 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.07502761305796134,1.5015794141222492e-09,7.796391153313574e-14,0.03375410193360803,2.833005246471428e-14,1.6895726652894908e-13,0.890713081944255,0.0005051996889087064,1.8734121596842537e-09
1534,Shorter SukhÄvatÄ«vyÅ«ha SÅ«tra,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Shorter SukhÄvatÄ«vyÅ«ha SÅ«tra

The Shorter SukhÄvatÄ«vyÅ«ha SÅ«tra (The AmitÄbha  Sutra; ä½èªªé¿å½éç¶; T12, 366) is one of the most fundamental texts for Pure Land Buddhism. It depicts the SukhÄvatÄ«, the wonderous Pure Land of AmitÄbha, and lists the salvific benefits of being reborn there. Together with the Longer SukhÄvatÄ«vyÅ«ha SÅ«tra (Infinite Life Sutra; ä½èªªç¡éå£½ç¶) and the AmitÄyus Contemplation SÅ«tra (Sutra on the Contemplation of the Buddha Immeasurable Life; ä½èªªè§ç¡éå£½ç¶), three sutras constitute the textual pillar of Pure Land Buddhism in East Asia. 
The sutra starts at the ÅÄkyamuni Buddhaâs preaching at Jetavana VihÄra, ÅrÄvastÄ«, to his major disciples and numerous Boddhisattvas. The Buddha introduces SukhÄvatÄ«, the AmitÄbhaâs distant pure land of ultimate bliss. In his Western Pure Land, all objectsâthe land, architecture, adornments, and living beingsâare the manifestation of the Dharma. Those who are reborn in SukhÄvatÄ« do not even know the ideas of ""evil"" and ""suffering."" The three lower realms of rebirth (animal, hungry ghost, hell) do not exist. Those who are reborn there automatically gain salvific progress from hearing the miraculous and dharmic sounds of its heavenly beings. The Buddha then explains the meanings of the name âAmitayusâ/âAmitÄbhaâ as the Buddha of immeasurable lifespan and immeasurable light.
The Pure Land rebirth requires the person to hear the name of AmitÄbha and hold this name in mind for seven days, without any disturbance. If at the moment of death, one remains mentally undisturbed, AmitÄbha and his assemblies will appear to facilitate the person to be reborn in the Pure Land. Then, the sutra moves to the confirmation sections. The sutra offers the praises and endorsements of the AmitÄbha Buddha by all other Buddhas. It proclaims the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas from the six directions all affirm the inconceivable qualities of SukhÄvatÄ« and exhort the listeners to seek rebirth there. Finally, the sutra emphasizes the importance of faith and bodhisattva vows. The Bodhisattva Vows made by the realized Buddhas, including AmitÄbha, are the core tenet that affirms the efficacy of Pure Land practices. And compared to all other practices in the Saha World, the Pure Land belief in AmitÄbha is the most accessible and easy one.
In contrast to other Pure Land sutras, the Shorter SukhÄvatÄ«vyÅ«ha SÅ«tra does not contain the specific forty-eight Bodhisattva vows made by the then DharmÄkara Bodhisattva, including to create a field with inconceivable wondrous qualities and who collects the mind to the AmitÄbha Buddha ten times will be reborn in his land (except who violated five deadly precepts). Based on scholastic commentaries, the path of Pure Land is the âeasy path.â In Japan, the power of AmitÄbha is further labeled as the Tariki (the Power of the Other).
Philologically speaking, the origin of the Shorter SukhÄvatÄ«vyÅ«ha SÅ«tra is still a mystery. The earliest Sanskrit copy was discovered in the GandhÄra region, northern India, and probably composed in the first century CE. Presumably the sutra, as part of the MahÄyÄna repertoire, was popular in pre-Islamic Central Asia. The Sanskrit edition was first translated by Max MÃ¼ller and his cohorts in 1875. It was translated again by Luis O. Gomez in 1996. 
Since its translation into Chinese, the sutra gradually became the most fundamental text in East Asia. The first Chinese translation was by KumÄrajÄ«va in 402. It was subsequently translated again by Guá¹abhadra from 454-456 and by Xuanzang in 650. The text was also translated into Tibetan from the ninth century onward.
The sutra received extensive commentaries from East Asia monastics. In China, nianfo (being Mindful of the Buddha) became a diffused Buddhist practice that was adopted by many indigenous traditions. In Japan, monastics who favored the text formed JÅdo shÅ«, JÅdo ShinshÅ«, and Nichiren.",100,2022,1722,727,Guanxiong Qi,45,Matthew Hamm,2022-10-07 11:56:45.528 +0200,2023-01-03 15:42:39.674 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),2.8569234602730355e-26,7.584060714256011e-25,0.9998560123547349,1.738932592329953e-12,3.691993633422088e-14,8.268547285418347e-47,0.0001439875952895928,4.005506731789763e-34,4.819969559223922e-11

1540,The Sanskrit Yasna,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Yasna is the Zoroastrian long liturgy. Originally composed in Avestan, it was then translated into Pahlavi and some comments to the text were added. Then, the text was brought to India by the Parsi community and, presumably between the 12th and the 14th century, further translated into Sanskrit. The Sanskrit text includes many layers, namely a proper translation of the original text of the Yasna, based however on the Pahlavi version, with occasional direct reference to the original Avestan text; the translation into Sanskrit of some Pahlavi comments to the text; original Sanskrit comments, added to explain further the Zoroastrian concepts and adapt them to the Indian sociocultural environment. Finally, a few Sanskrit ritual instructions were added to the text.
The Sanskrit version has never had a ritual value, but it is in any case interesting from a religious point of view. In fact, the significant terms of the Zoroastrian cult are rendered with meaningful terms belonging to other religious traditions such as Hinduism, Buddhism and, above all, Jainism. The Jaina environment of Gujarat has deeply influenced the Sanskrit version of the Yasna: for instance, the script, the so-called Parsi NÄgarÄ«, is very close to the Jaina NÄgarÄ«; the palaeography is close to the Jaina one, too; the text includes graphical elements which recalls the ones present in Jaina manuscripts, etc. 

A systematic translation project is recognisable behind the Sanskrit text, whose compilation was influenced by both Indian regional features and the Zoroastrian tradition. In the translation process, the passage from one language to the other implies the adaptation of all the formal and semantic aspects of terms and expressions. In this case, the passage went through two steps, first from Avestan to Pahlavi and then from Pahlavi to Sanskrit. The translators into Sanskrit were philologists ante litteram, who carried out a refined work of Indo-Iranian comparative philology. 

Finally, the geographical settlement of the Parsi community in (north-)western India, a land which has always been characterised by religious and cultural syncretism, has for sure encouraged such kind of refined study and comment to the text. 

There are still many open questions and the reason of the translation into Sanskrit is not clear, since the Parsi ritual language has always been Avestan and their mother tongue Gujarati. Were they trying to reach out other Indian communities and promote themselves at court? Were they providing a well-known Indian format to the Parsi community itself? The Sanskrit text of the Yasna is therefore not useful on a ritual level, but it may be extremely meaningful to throw light on the socio-cultural context of its compilation.",1100,1400,677,1119,Martina Palladino,24,Travis Chilcott,2022-10-11 18:13:00.395 +0200,2023-01-01 20:04:53.587 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),2.7892578887167796e-14,8.503311288062186e-14,0.05106928195984273,0.9373823200944018,0.0009271666095976525,6.076758704695123e-15,0.010620989193966349,1.7612752084796979e-25,2.42142072585893e-07
1544,Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church is both a minority faith in Ukraine yet also a Church that has exerted a great deal of influence on Ukrainian culture and politics throughout the 19th and 20th centuries until today. While most Ukrainians identify as Orthodox, in the regions of western Ukraine it was the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church that historically served as the religious affiliation for the Ukrainian-speaking population. Created as a hybrid Church through a church union (the 1596 Union of Brest) as a way to absorb Orthodox Slavs into Catholic jurisdictions in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, this religious institution remained an influential force in the territories of present-day western Ukraine as empires rose and fell in eastern Europe. The Church endured as its parishes became part of Habsburg Austria-Hungary, interwar Poland, and even under Nazi occupation. This endurance is credited to one of the most influential leaders of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, Metropolitan Andrei Sheptytsky, who served as Metropolitan from 1900-1944. Under his tenure, the Church sought to create a path for itself as both a religious institution and a Ukrainian cultural institution. Metropolitan Sheptytskyâs death coincided with the imposition of Soviet power in western Ukraine in 1944. Over the course of this history, the rituals and beliefs of Ukrainian Greek Catholics were deeply influenced by the more powerful religious institutions surrounding it, the Vatican and the Russian Orthodox Church. The Church endured campaigns of forced transfer to Russian Orthodoxy in territories conquered by imperial Russia and in territories ruled by Catholic monarchies, forced latinizations of its rituals. In the aftermath of the Second World War and the Sovietization of western Ukraine, the Soviet state did not simply ban the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, but embarked on a religious campaign that resembled that of its imperial predecessors, forcing its three million Ukrainian Greek Catholics to join the state-sponsored Russian Orthodox Church. Some accepted Orthodoxy, others simply pretended to accept Orthodoxy, while others maintained the practices of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in the underground. Through these experiences, the Church developed its own particular liturgical practices and rituals that reflected its interpretations of what a church union between Orthodoxy and Catholicism meant in practice. These practices reflect a complex negotiation of religious influences imposed by force, as well as influences welcomed into the Church through natural processes of cultural exchange. Because of its hybrid nature, the Church also became a religious institution that tolerated a great deal of variation among rituals between its parishes. In practice this means that while Church institutions have taken formal positions on the correct interpretation of variances between the Byzantine and Latin-rite, variances that include the sacrament of the Eucharist and the filioque, different parishes will follow different customs based on their particular histories and the practices and traditions most familiar to local parishioners. The Church's recent history has been shaped by its role in independent Ukraine. As the Soviet Union began to collapse in the early 1990s, the Church was permitted to emerge from the underground and its activists became instrumental in the movement for Ukraine's independence from the Soviet Union. In recent decades, the Vatican has attempted to codify the rituals and practices of Eastern churches like the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church as part of a project of recognizing the contributions of these unique spiritual cultures, rather than seeing them as aberrations that need to be âlatinized.â Today, the Church's endurance is seen as tied up with the endurance of the Ukrainian nation itself, even though that nation is primarily Orthodox. As an institution, the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church maintains an intensive involvement in Ukrainian society through its network of educational institutions, charitable endeavors, and military chaplaincy, involvement which influences Ukrainians of all faith traditions.",1596,2022,331,1110,Kathryn David,40,Stephen Christopher,2022-10-17 17:51:16.716 +0200,2022-12-02 00:08:01.710 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.03889908955680644,0.14850445386805372,7.569673686244473e-14,0.36147072294318183,0.009116687727388403,0.1922427369018251,0.20388866367238115,0.04587758461602675,6.07142608049594e-08
1546,4QPseudo Ezekiel,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Words of Ezekiel (WoEzek) or Pseudo-Ezekiel are the designated names to a group of manuscripts found among the Dead Sea Scrolls. The composition which was not known prior to its discovery in Qumran is commonly associated with the prophet Ezekiel and his oracles. WoEzek was preserved in at least three fragmentary parchment copies, sharing an overlapping textual section: 4Q385, 4Q386 and 4Q388. Two additional sigla numbers are associated with the composition: 4Q385b which contains a single fragment, and the papyrus scroll 4Q391. These manuscripts do not share any textual parallels with the scrolls stated above, yet 4Q385b and 4Q391 are identified as additional copies of WoEzek based on their rewriting style of the scriptural text of Ezekiel. The earliest manuscript, 4Q391 is dated to 150-100 BCE, while the other scrolls are roughly dated to 50-25 BCE. Although the composition was found in Qumran, its content does not show any special connection to the religious movement settled at the site (the Yahad), and thus it could have originated among different social groups in the Second Temple period. The composition contains a series of visions revealed to the prophet Ezekiel. Some of the preserved oracles also appear in the biblical (or the scriptural) versions of the Book of Ezekiel known today, such as the vision of the dry bones (Ezek 37) or the merkavah (chariot) vision (Ezek 1 and 10). Other sections are not known from any textual witnesses of scriptural Ezekiel, and their context is rather the Jewish literary and ideological framework in the Second Temple period. WoEzek is often categorised as âpseudo-propheticâ text (Dimant, 2001), and ârewritten scriptureâ (Zahn, 2014). It means that the composition uses the voice of the prophet and rewrites the scriptural source by setting it in a new framework and putting it to a different use. While the fragmentary state of the composition makes it difficult to determine its context, the principal orientation of the text is most likely apocalyptic, as it often highlights the apocalyptic connotation which can be attributed to Ezekielâs oracles. The text contains references to the âday of the lordâ and suggests that the redemption reflected through the vision of the dry bones is promised exclusively to the righteous among Israel, whose reward will be an actual resurrection at the eschatological end of the current universe.",-150,-25,1753,1091,Anna Shirav,50,Andrew Danielson,2022-10-19 13:14:57.361 +0200,2022-11-10 23:51:37.395 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.001034145734573229,0.032735554087467394,3.078985490002698e-15,0.06678064512166394,0.0021137176657055295,0.2921571852073027,0.0004072177527073317,0.5886791415712541,0.01609239285932257
1549,Slaying of Husayn Texts,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"A series of succession crises followed the death of the Islamic Prophet Muá¸¥ammad. One such crisis took place in the year 680 CE. Those who favored Muá¸¥ammadâs bloodline believed Ê¿AlÄ«âs eldest son á¸¤asan (c. 625-670) to be the divinely appointed leader. á¸¤asan capitulated to the Caliph MuÊ¿Äwiya in order to avoid bloodshed, but there seems to have been a tacit agreement that at MuÊ¿Äwiyaâs death the leadership would return to the Prophetâs household.  á¸¤asan predeceased MuÊ¿Äwiya, leaving á¸¤usayn as the supposed successor, but on his deathbed MuÊ¿Äwiya transferred power to his own son YazÄ«d. Unlike his older brother, á¸¤usayn was not content to trade deference for peace, and in the 61st year of the Islamic calendar á¸¤usayn and a handful of his companions met YazÄ«dâs forces on the plains of KarbalÄÊ¾ on the banks of the Euphrates River in Iraq. The outcome of the âbattleâ was a foregone conclusionâaccording to traditional sources of this narrative á¸¤usaynâs band of a hundred-odd men, women, and children was several orders of magnitude smaller than YazÄ«dâs army.  Virtually all who fought with á¸¤usayn died in a massacre which has thence served as the definitive event for ShÄ«Ê¿ite piety. From relatively soon after the battle á¸¤usaynâs partisans have commemorated his martyrdom through a series of rituals, legends, and elegies which have grown increasingly elaborate through the centuries.

1551,Donation Texts from Ur during the Isin-Larsa Period,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"At Ur, a range of documents called âdonation textsâ were unearthed. They are small tablets that registered quantities of semi-precious stones, silver and gold given to the temple of Ningal, the goddess protector of the city of Ur. The items were delivered by individual, including women. These documents belong to the archives of the unique religious complex of the city which included in its centre a ziggurat. The texts was excavated by Sir L. Woolley at Ur and are now preserved in the British Museum. I started to work on these texts during my doctoral dissertation and edited them in my book on the ornamentation of the gods in the Old Babylonian period (Maggio 2012). I take great interest in these documents because they are a rich source of information on worshipping practices, despite the difficulties that persist in the interpretation of certain cuneiform signs. These difficulties make us feel as though they are written at a turning point in Mesopotamian history. In this southern city, customs were changing. There was a tension between Sumerian traditions and the Akkadian traditions being introduced in the region. This tension implies some difficulties in the use of those two languages in the documentation. It is well established in this documentation that the objects belonging to the goddess Ningal and occasionally also to other deities were undoubtedly linked to her cult at Ur. Most probably, there were chapels dedicated to these deities in the temple of Ningal. The ornamental stone fragments were probably part of a larger piece of jewellery, such as necklace, but were torn off and dedicated to Ningal by their owners. From that moment on, they became the property of the temple and were used to adorn the goddess Ningal, and maybe other statues of lesser deities. In addition, one may wonder whether a particular area of the temple of Ningal itself was used for the storage of the goods, altough the available documentation does not mention it. Instead we know that the objects dedicated to the deities of the Ningal temple could be stored along with other materials in the nearby Ganunmaá¸«.",-1970,-1850,1586,1261,MichÃ¨le Maggio,50,Andrew Danielson,2022-10-24 11:42:12.250 +0200,2022-10-25 18:56:21.481 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.014387632925078771,0.058248573693316215,0.13198329126511574,0.1562359982418322,0.010564672290203818,0.01507164171277677,0.6104271546499745,0.0030809674868355367,6.773486644165314e-08
1552,The Key of Ilme Ká¹£num to Understand the Zoroastrian Religion,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"âThe key of Ilme Ká¹£num to understand the Zoroastrian religionâ is the first book authored by Behramshah Naoroji Shroff (1858-1927), a Parsi gentleman from Surat, Gujarat (India). In 1906, Shroff made known Ilm-e-Khshnoom, an esoteric interpretation of Zoroastrianism, among the Parsis and spread its beliefs until his death. It is believed that he acquired such esoteric knowledge over three years, while he was staying with a community of Zoroastrian sages secluded in a village situated on Mount Damavand, in Iran. Ilm-e-Khshnoom offers a reconciliation between Persianate and Western systems of esoteric knowledge. âThe Key of Ilme Ká¹£num to Understand the Zoroastrian Religionâ is the first book published by Shroff and represents his only publication where the beliefs of Ilm-e-Khshnoom are systematically presented as a set of natural laws. In this regard, it is a fundamental text to further our understanding of Ilm-e-Khshnoom from a historical, cultural, sociological, and linguistic point of view. The following publications of Shroff, instead, focus on specific aspects of the Zoroastrian liturgy or of the Parsi life.
Being the first publication of Shroff as well as the first book on the subject of Ilm-e-Khshnoom, âThe Key of Ilme Ká¹£num to Understand the Zoroastrian Religionâ inaugurates the religious literature consisting of hundreds of books and articles, mainly composed in Gujarati. This knowledge production still continues nowadays, though English has become the main language used for publications.
Besides offering a thorough overview of the system of beliefs of Ilm-e-Khshnoom, one of the key features of this book is the presence of a large number of technical terms (also known in Gujarati as logato) whose genealogical study sheds light on the hermeneutical choices adopted by Shroff. Further, the dedication note and the foreword contain important elements that allow to ascribe the story of the initiation of Shroff and the relation with his masters to some narrative elements of the nationalist discourse of the 19th and 20th centuries-Iran. The textual analysis of this book, in effect, uncovers the cultural entanglements between the Persianate world, the Western sphere of influence, and India. The Parsis play a critical role in these entanglements, furthering connections and favouring cultural transfers; in particular, transculturation. Ilm-e-Khshnoom and âThe Key of Ilme Ká¹£num to Understand the Zoroastrian Religionâ, in this regard, are the result of such entanglements and activities of transculturation between the Persianate, the West, and India.",1911,2022,1760,755,Mariano Errichiello,43,Quinn Clark,2022-10-24 19:12:06.947 +0200,2024-05-31 23:21:17.152 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),4.758941553252686e-28,1.9735241541277406e-34,0.991123102509084,2.1962975701104818e-14,2.6366641410842077e-14,1.4142911830260696e-48,3.013287248990955e-05,3.3703829749466814e-36,0.008846764618377663

1558,Acts of Paul and Thecla,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Acts of Paul and Thecla (APTh) is a popular second-century Christian text, with an entertaining tone and a message in favor of female chastity. It tells the story of Thecla, an elite virgin of the city of Iconium (in present-day Turkey) who overcomes severe persecution - through miracles, divine interventions, and a sturdy personality - to become an itinerant preacher and baptizer. The text once circulated independently but itâs now part of the larger collection of the Acts of Paul. It has clear narrative parallels with womenâs stories in the other apocryphal acts.
In more detail, the story tells how Thecla converts to Christianity after hearing the words of the Apostle Paul in one of his itinerant preachings. She decides to leave her family behind to join Paulâs group, but her mother and her fiancÃ©Ã© search the authorities to denounce the apostle for corrupting female youth. As a result, Paul is banned from Iconium, and Thecla is condemned to death. Miracles happen while sheâs in the arena - the beasts and the fire cannot hurt her and she baptizes herself in a pool full of seals. The authorities decide to release her and she finally receives approval from Paul to go around the world and teach the word of God. She travels to Seleucia and, according to one manuscript variation, lives as an ascetic teacher for 72 years in a cave in the desert.
The authorship of the text is uncertain. Scholars debate whether the story originates from oral legends or from a male writer. In De Baptismo (190 CE), the Church Father Tertullian presents it as a forgery from a male presbyter and reproaches those who had been using Theclaâs story as a justification for female leadership. 
With themes such as conversion, conflicts between the birth family and spiritual family, opposition to the Roman Empire, and gender relations, the APTh has been a popular text among Christians in Antiquity, the followers of the cult of Saint Thecla (still active today in Turkey) and scholars.
There are over forty primitive manuscripts of the APTh only in Greek, and also Latin, Syriac, Armenian and Slavonic versions. Modern scholars, however, have been cautious in considering it a reliable source for the historical reconstruction of Christian communities and womenâs lives around the ancient Mediterranean.",150,200,1495,1136,Naiara LeÃ£o,49,Ian Randall,2022-10-31 17:52:47.376 +0100,2022-12-02 00:20:43.487 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),3.405055742357652e-15,2.9677390721739516e-14,0.09117867519036102,1.7458204954862598e-12,0.90878727668284,6.808024312062014e-23,3.0105788010001903e-05,7.298715358461212e-23,3.942337009995099e-06

The âcommentaryâ grew out of other texts and was written down as The Peerless Method by Muá¸¥ammad al-WÄlÄ« ibn SulaymÄn al-FulÄnÄ« al-BaghirmÄwÄ« al-BarnÄwÄ«  (ÙØ­ÙØ¯ Ø§ÙÙØ§ÙÙ Ø¨Ù Ø³ÙÙÙØ§Ù Ø§ÙÙÙØ§ÙÙ Ø§ÙØ¨ØºØ±ÙØ§ÙÙ Ø§ÙØ¨Ø±ÙØ§ÙÙ) in the second half of the seventeenth century.  
Its importance for Muslims in the region appears from the fact that it was often copied and 32 copies are still extant today. They are kept in libraries across West Africa, in Paris and in the Herskovits Library of Northwestern University, Evanston, Michigan.
Al-WÄlÄ« claims that his Peerless Method is the translation of a pre-existing comment by Fulani (Peul) scholars, and it is indeed clearly related to the Fulani tradition of the kabbe, which elaborated the á¹¢ughra into an oral âtextbookâ for the teaching of Islam to ordinary, and mostly illiterate believers. 
All-SanÅ«sÄ«âs á¹¢ughra was popular almost as soon as it left the hands of its author. It was versified and commented on early in the sixteenth century and it has played a role in the spread of Islam from Africa to Indonesia. Essentially it is a scholastic work in which Godâs attributes (ØµÙØ§Øª Ø§ÙÙÙ ) and those of the prophets are explained according to Aristotleâs categories of what is necessary  (God is eternal, for instance), what is impossible (that God would resemble temporal things, for instance) and what is possible (that God causes particular things, for instance). But it is also short and simple. It was meant to give believers more knowledge of a central (Ashê¤ari) doctrine of their religion.  
Moreover, the final lines of al-SanÅ«sÄ«âs text take into account that intellect was not the only route to the knowledge of religious truth. Understanding could also be reached by methods of mysticism, in particular by internalising the knowledge represented by the words of the shahÄda, the words with which Muslims testify that there is no god except God. Essentially, al-SanÅ«sÄ«âs aim was the commitment to Islam of as many believers as possible. It was an inclusive goal. 
The same was true of the oral kabbe tradition. In texts that belong to this tradition the á¹¢ughra is reformulated to teach it to Muslims in West Africa. General information about the culture and the religion of Islam was added for new converts. The kabbe was taught in Fulfulde, the language of the Fulani âmissionariesâ. Kabbe versions of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries continued to address a very broad audience of mainly illiterate believers. They, too, present their content as one of two equally important âfieldsâ of religious knowledgeânotably, knowledge about the manifest laws and principles, and knowledge about hidden truths, which could be obtained by following the path of the mystic. 
Al-WÄlÄ«âs Peerless Method  turns this inclusiveness of the á¹¢ughra and the kabbe completely around, in spite of the tight format of the commentary in which explanations are added to the original text line by line. It does this by hammering away at the idea that anyone who cannot reproduce the proofs of Godâs oneness as they are presented in the PM and who can only parrot the words of shahÄda without all this knowledge behind it, is an imitator, a muqallid ( ÙÙÙØ¯ ). 
This knowledge which the believer was supposed to memorise â not even in his mother tongue, but in fuá¹£á¸¥a Arabic - was much more extensive than what the á¹¢ughra had laid out. It included for instance an explanation of the relation between Godâs oneness and the creation of the world, according to Muê¤tazili philosophy. Saying that anyone who did not master such knowledge was an imitator, came down to saying that anyone who did not spend a lot of time with an ê¤Älim and submitted to his authority, was an imitator. Moreover, the PM repeats many times that the muqallid is an unbeliever. That was an unorthodox point of view, which did however also surface among groups of proselytizers towards the west, for instance in Sijilmasa. By giving the idea a place within the canonic tradition of the á¹¢ughra and the kabbe, al-WÄlÄ« made it salon-fÃ¤hig. 
The popularity of the PM bears witness of a concern among many Muslims in al-WÄlÄ«âs environment with defining as clearly as possible who belonged and who did not belong to the Muslim community. A second concern it reveals is that with the position of the scholar. The role of scholars was under pressure by a trend in sufism that attached much importance to knowledge obtained by meditation or in dreams and played down the role of book-learning. Against this background, the PM presented the ê¤ulamÄâs specialised knowledge as indispensable for the ordinary believer who did not want to be mistaken for an unbeliever. But the most important contribution al-WÄlÄ« made to support his colleagues was that he put the popular and authoritative text based on the oral kabbe in writing. By doing so he claimed it as âpropertyâ of  the religious scholars, whose trademark and monopoly was the craft of writing. And to write it, the Fulfulde text had to be translated into Arabic.",1650,1850,1772,1267,Dorrit van Dalen,55,Julian Weideman,2022-11-01 10:34:00.447 +0100,2022-11-08 23:51:53.905 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),7.63601850901237e-18,4.487143846707672e-15,0.04800136519244112,1.2971946687874557e-13,0.5051674827101539,2.1156944378044754e-24,1.6249697435137819e-07,2.649575477121652e-23,0.4468309896002963

1570,Tamil Muslims,43,Religious Group (v6),"Tamil Muslims are a community in southern India who practice Islam. Although a very diverse group, they share some common religious, cultural, and linguistic affinities. They are primarily located in Tamil Nadu, India, with populations spread across India, Sri Lanka, South East Asia, Gulf Cooperation Countries (GCC), and the United States. Muslims in Tamil Nadu are not a monolithic community; they speak multiple languages (mainly Tamil, Urdu, Telugu, and Bohri Gujarati), and have diverse histories and practices. This entry primarily focuses on Tamil-speaking Muslims in India.

Islam has a long and distinctive history in the Tamil region, at least since ninth century through centuries-old Arab trade, and largely separate from the more familiar narratives of Muslim conquest in north India. The circulation of religious practices and the maintenance of oceanic connections is an important aspect of both Tamil Muslim history as well as the present. The Tamil region has had historical connections with the Bay of Bengal littoral through the circulation of Muslims and their textual practicesâbetween Tamil-speaking South India (Maâbar) and Southeast Asia (Nusuntara)âsince at least the fifteenth century. 

Coastal trading towns in Tamil Nadu became well-known for their religious spaces and institutionsâmosques, dargahs (tomb-shrines of Muslim saints), and madrassas (Islamic religious schools). It was not just the southern coastal belt but also northern Tamil Nadu where notable Islamic seminaries were established. The inland city of Madurai was briefly ruled by the Madurai Sultanates in the fourteenth century, while the Urdu-speaking Arcot Nawabs have also had a presence in the region since the seventeenth century.

A simplified sociological and caste-like classification of Tamil-speaking Muslims exists, namely the distinction between Maraikkayar (elite, coastal Sunni Muslims who were originally seafaring merchants),  Lebbai (religious scholars but from a lower social-economic strata), and Rowther (descendants of former Muslim cavalrymen who traded in horses). However, scholars such as Torsten Tschacher have cautioned against the homogenizing imperative and orientalist presuppositions of such sociological distinctions. Although this terminology continues to be used by Muslims today, the diverse ways in which people self-identity with one âsub-groupâ or the other cannot stand in for a classificatory schema. 

Today, Tamil Nadu is home to various Muslim shrines (dargahs), important pilgrimage centers, historical mosques built in the Dravida style of architecture, and Islamic seminaries. Tamil Muslim cuisine is distinctive, with influences from Arab, Malay, Sri Lankan, and Southeast Asia regions.",1900,2024,1117,1248,Harini Kumar,43,Quinn Clark,2022-11-11 01:51:51.538 +0100,2024-05-31 23:18:25.652 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),5.992459470017911e-18,1.9834184289047645e-14,0.007051742511038414,0.081849680127048,0.0007345045469533231,3.763382919709758e-25,1.4335762327643046e-07,3.056015157535171e-23,0.910363929457317
1574,Household religion at Ur,43,Religious Group (v6),"Ur, modern Tell el-Muqayyar, in southern Iraq, is one of the most ancient cities of Mesopotamia; it hosted a very important cult complex dedicated to the Moon-God â Nanna in Sumerian, Suen in Akkadian â including a temple, a ziqqurat and residences for the king and the high priestess. Two extended quarters of private houses, dating from the beginning of the 2nd millennium BCE were brought to light; they are quite well preserved and many of them featured burials under their floors. Of particular interest are some built underground tombs: according to L. Woolley, their excavator, these tombs were related to large rooms, with special features interpreted as cult installations, and with the largest  room of the house, interpreted as a reception room. The final interpretation was that at Ur they practiced funerary cults  for the ancestors in private chapels, accessible to the members of the household and to their guests. Upon a new analysis of the evidence, it was observed that the connection between built tombs and chapels was not a constant element: in 15 houses there were chapels only; in 15 houses the chapel was related with a tomb; in 17 houses there were the tombs but no chapel. Chapels for private cults are also attested in the same period at Nippur, Tell Asmar and Tell Brak, but they are not associated with tombs. The chapels feature altars ca. 50 cm high and structures looking like miniature temples, up to 1.40 m high; a hearth with a long chimney reaching to the roof was interpreted as an incense-burner. The main interpretations for these chapels are: 1) places for funerary cults (to be dismissed for the lack of a constant correlation with tombs); 2) cult for ""family gods"" (doubtful because minor gods had their small temples within the domestic quarters); 3) places for private ceremonies connecting the extended family and other social groups to enhance social bonds, for instance for marriages and/or economic contracts.",-2000,-1800,1328,1258,Frances Pinnock,50,Andrew Danielson,2022-11-14 14:26:47.018 +0100,2022-11-14 14:26:47.018 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.005147472502170108,6.066558286536027e-10,3.504731714769577e-16,0.0007739043568558694,1.2626804101162209e-26,4.136413609010027e-15,0.994078622513674,2.0639852230104568e-11,7.546362753860482e-22

1576,Book of Amos,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The book of Amos is one of the prophetic books (Nevi'im) canonized in the Hebrew Bible. It is one of twelve ""Minor"" or shorter prophetic books, which in the Jewish Tanakh appear together as a single ""Book of the Twelve,"" whereas they are twelve separate books in the Christian Old Testament. The book of Amos consists of 9 chapters associated with the words and actions of a Judean prophet named Amos. Amos is identified as a pastoralist and agriculturalist from Tekoa in the southern kingdom of Judah, whom Yahweh called to prophesy in the northern kingdom of Israel around the year 760 BCE (1:1; 7:14-15). There is no historical evidence concerning this person outside of the book of Amos. The book claims that the reason Amos was commissioned as a prophet was to warn the Israelites about how their abuses of social justice and their wrongheaded and hypocritical worship practices are going to lead to severe punishment from Yahweh. The sayings and events described in the book appear to take place within a short time period (perhaps no more than a year) during the mid-8th century BCE. The punishment predicted by the prophet Amos has a long tradition of being interpreted as referring to Israel's defeat and exile at the hands of the Neo-Assyrian empire in 721 BCE, but the book never refers to this event explicitly. The book of Amos was originally written in Hebrew, but in its oldest forms it has been preserved in slightly different versions: the Masoretic Text in Hebrew and the Septuagint in Greek. Both of these traditions are attested at Qumran, suggesting that the text of the book of Amos had not been finalized by the first century BCE. Many scholars suggest that parts of the book can be traced back to an 8th-century BCE prophet, but the book as a literary product is mostly the work of later Judean editors, including some belonging to the Deuteronomistic school of thought. The text consists mostly of poetic oracles presented as the words of Yahweh spoken through the prophet Amos, but there are also a few short prose extracts (e.g. Amos 7:10-17).",-760,-100,1795,1214,Rosanne Liebermann,50,Andrew Danielson,2022-11-15 19:07:58.293 +0100,2022-11-23 23:03:29.653 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),9.242930856356832e-05,3.941376462537738e-09,3.6474364353212187e-13,0.062430177477762534,1.4763150858374276e-13,9.386314193852365e-23,0.00026471471538099786,0.8178746004611817,0.11933807409522235

1582,Cult of Bona Dea,43,Religious Group (v6),"Who exactly was Bona Dea (âGood Goddessâ) can be extrapolated from the myths found in a couple of imperial sources. According to Plutarch (Plut. Quaest. Rom. 29.268DE; Arnobius Nat. 5.18; Lactantius D.I. 1.22.9-11) (Versnel 2006), Bona Dea was the wife of Faunus who was so pure that she never left her room. Yet, one day she secretly became drunk that Faunus beat her to death but repented and made her a deity. Or she, called Fauna, Ops, or Fatua, was the daughter of Faunus who lusted after her, pursued her, and beat her with myrtle branches; he finally achieved his goal after transforming into a snake (Macrob.Sat.1.12.24) (Versnel 2006, 1992). Additionally, there is an account that states that Hercules was celebrating the festival of Bona Dea but was refused a drink by the women; therefore, Hercules excluded women from celebrating his sacrifice at the Ara Maxima (Versnel 2006). There are also some Bacchanal associations in antiquity with the Bona Dea practice (Mulroy 1988; Dieterich 1893), such as the identification of the goddess with Semele (Macrobius 1.12.23), the exaggeration of the ceremony as an orgy (Juvenal 6.314-34), flagellation, the presence of serpents that point to the Maenads, and this would explain Clodiusâ cross-dressing (see the account below). Yet, Lott (2014/15), following Brouwer (1989), has claimed that Bona Dea had no male consort in the Roman cult, despite the story given by Plutarch.

What we know about the cult of Bona Dea from literary and archeological evidence is that the cult of Bona Dea may have had origins in Latium and non-uniform cultic practice depending on the social class of the worshipper. In the state cult of Roman religion only women participated in the ceremonies in nocturnal and secret celebrations on December 1st in the house of the leading Roman consul (Brouwer 1989). Under supervision of the wife or mother of the Roman consul of that year, the consul had to leave his house and all the images of male members of the familia (âRoman familyâ) had to be removed (Versnel 1992, Brouwer 1989). In participation were also the Vestal Virgins (Cic.Har.res.37; Plut.Caes.9), priestesses who took vows of celibacy and attended to the Sacred Flame.

There is some information about the rituals from Cicero and imperial sources. According to ancient literary sources (North 2018; Versnel 2006), the room where the ritual took place was decorated with vine twigs, though myrtle was banned (Plut. Quaest. Rom. 20.268D). There was the sacrifice of a porca (âsowâ) (Macrob.Sat.1.12.23), and the drinking of wine, called lac (âmilkâ), and brought in a mellarium (âhoney potâ) (Macrob.Sat.1.12.25; Plut. Quaest. Rom. 20.268D), and there was music and dancing. Versnel 2006 sees this aristocratic practice as a vestigial element of an older Roman practice that celebrated human and agricultural activity, and its closeness to the Greek festival of Demeter, the Thesmophoria, which took place in the political center of the city, denied men access, celebrated female reproductivity, allowed women the rights of men, such as the enjoyment of wine (Versnel 2006; 1992; not absolute rule, see Piccaluga 1964; De Cazanova 1987; Aulus Gellius 10.23.1-2), but excluded myrtle, because myrtle was closely associated with Venus (sexuality) in the ancient sources, such as Plutarch (Quaest.Rom.20), Pliny (NH 15.121), and Varro (de ling.lat. 5.154) (Brouwer 1989). Because wine was also an aphrodisiac (Val. Max. 2.1.5), myrtle was removed in order to highlight a ritualistic use of the wine traditionally offered to the gods (temetum) (Versnel 1992) (Brouwer 1989). If one considers the presence of the Vestal Virgins as well, the Roman matrons too are considered ambiguously virgins (Versnel 1992).

Hence the great scandal in 62 BC involving Publius Clodius Pulcher whose account is detailed fully in Plutarchâs Caesar 9-10 (his political enemy Cicero also makes some remarks on Clodiusâ cross dressing: Ad Atticum.1.12.2; 1.13.3). As the story goes, Clodius was in love with Pompeia, married to Caesar and who was being watched by her mother-in-law Aurelia. Because of this, Clodius dressed up as a flute girl in order to see Pompeia on the night of the Bona Dea at her house (also in Cic.de Haruspicum Responsis 5.8). He was admitted by a slave girl who was involved in the scheme, and Clodius, tired of waiting for Pompeia, went to go find her. In some accounts (Velleius Paterculus 2.45.1, Suet.Caesar 6.2; Appian Bella Civilia .2.14.52; Cassius Dio 37.45; Livyâs epitome 103), building upon Ciceroâs speeches (Mil.72, Harusp.8; Pis.95) Clodius and Pompeia committed adultery (Mulroy 1988). In Plutarchâs version, however, he was accosted by another slave girl, who first asked him to play with her, and he answered that he was waiting for Habra, the very name of his inquirer. Habra recognized the male voice and screamed that a man was present. Aurelia stopped the service and Clodius was found hiding in Habraâs room. The women went home, told their husbands, and political outcry occurred. As a result, Caesar divorced Pompeia.

Another important cult site in the city of Rome was that of the Aventine Hill where a temple and images of snakes were found. At first, the cult utilized the image and symbol of the Italic serpent which was a protective and guardian spirit; yet over time with the association of Bona Dea and Hygieia and other Greek influence, the snake became associated with prophecy and healing (Brouwer 1989). Returning to the temple and grove on the Aventine (Morgan 2014, Merlin 1906, Rubino 1868, Gilbert 1883-90), it has been identified as Bona Dea Subsaxsana (Propertius 4.9.24, 25, 33, 35, 53, 59-60; Ovid. Fasti. 3.327-30; and a Severan marble plan) and her celebrations occurred on May 1st. This festival in May mirrors that of the State Cult practice on December 1st where a female sacerdos (âpriestessâ in this context) led a secret rite that included the sacrifice of a (pregnant) sow, the use of wine, and prohibition of men from participation. Here, it is important to note that the sacrifice of the sow (Macrobius Saturnalia 1.12.20-29 and Juvenal 1.2.92-90) is rather scanty and there are examples in non-state cult functions, such as a fowls (Pliny NH 10.61 (77)) and heifers (via Ostiense , CIL Vi 68= ILS 3513)(Brouwer 1989).

There were also imperial practices outside the city of Rome. For example in Aquileia, although numerous inscriptions (CIL 5 761-762=ILS 3498-3499) point to a goddess with agricultural characteristics not emphasized in the Roman cult (Lott 2014/15), there was a temple dedicated to Augusta Bona Dea Cereria at Aquileia (Ov.Fas.5.157-8), restored by Livia, the wife of the emperor of Augustus. This location was not only for honoring Livia, but a center of worship of the goddess in which there was cake distribution on Liviaâs birthday (ILS 154)(Lott 2015/15)(Brouwer 1989). Imperial Augustan involvement might be corroborated by Berryâs (2011) analysis of the Bona Dea and Hercules episode recounted in Propertius 4, 9 where Hercules (representing imperial legislation on proper sexual behavior) bursts into the Sacred Grove, its waters, and dancing girls (private and elegiac context). According to Berry, the episode is a commentary on the legislation of 18 BC lex Iulia de maritandis ordinibus the intrusion of public world into Roman private lives. Yet, the combination of imperial nomenclature at Aquileia and the local goddess demonstrates how local communities built a consensus and relationship with the new imperial regime (Lott 2015/15) (Ando 2000).
 
We also know that throughout Latium and Rome there was the involvement of collegia (âprofessional clubsâ) that invoked Bona Dea as their patroness. Inscriptions paint a different picture from the aristocratic, political rituals detailed above (North 2018, and Versnel 2006). In the cultic practice by Roman collegia, there was no secrecy and men could participate (Brouwer 1989). Collegia members and ritual activity involving Bona Dea could include children, such as a seven-year-old priest (Waltzing I)(Brouwer 1989) and numbers of participants from 16 (CIL XIV 252 = Waltzing III, p.618, #2233) to 1,5000 (CIL VI 1060, 9405, 10.300 = Waltzing III, pp.199-200)(Brouwer 1989). Leaders of collegia and cult activity had numerous titles associated with them: curator, magister, minister, with sacerdos usually in the east (Brouwer 1989) and meeting locations could include aedes (âshrinesâ) or templa where the patron deity resided.

Other non-Roman cult practices included a Liburnian Bona Dea (CIL 5 757=ILS 4894), who was paired with the male deity, Fonio (Lott 2014/15). Also, a temple found in Ostia with paintings, excavated in 1938-1942 by Calza dating to the AD first century (Falzone 2006). The temple occupied a trapezoidal area in the back of the via degli augustali and had Late Republic to Domitian phases (Falzone 2006). The paintings found in the temple and portico depicted dancing Maenads and, perhaps, a Satyr, the offering of the grape (wine), and Dionysian elements all recall themes found in the myths of the Bona Dea (Falzone 2006). There is also a second temple found in Ostia outside the Porta Marina (Calza 1942; Meiggs 1973; Brouwer 1989). Finally, numerous inscriptions, such as in Segni in south Latium (EE VIII 624 = Dessau, ILS 3496)  and Fidenae (NSc.1929,263,Nr.11) that show that clothes were dedicated to the goddess, are attested throughout Italy and demonstrate is popular practice.

Bona Dea, moreover, was worshiped in private homes and demonstrate a multiplicity of ideas regarding the role Bona Dea played in the lives of private individuals under the Roman Empire. The most notable is the dedication of Calpurnia found in Dalmatia that included a host of titles, such as Heiae, Dominae, Augustae, Triumphali, terrae/marisque Dominatrici, Conservatrici, Mentiumque bonarum ac remediorum Potenti, Dea bene iudicanti  (Brouwer 1989, ch.1 #127). Here we can see Greek and Eastern influence on the salvific powers of Bona Dea. Some scholars have suggested that the Greek goddess was introduced in the 3rd century BC, while others, argued for a genuine Italian character. Versnel 2006 suggests that there was one Italian and one Greek, and at some point, the cults merged into one. Whatever the case may be, it seems that the female goddess was the protector of her locality.

In sum, the cult of the Bona Dea, perhaps, began in Latium and as Roman power expanded in the Mediterranean so did the cult (found also in Africa and Gaul), while it also adopted ideas from Greek and Eastern religions. The cult, perhaps, although epigraphic and literary sources at earliest date back to the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC, began in the prehistory of Latium (Brouwer 1989) and lasted until the 5th century AD, although some have argued for an earlier date of demist to the Antonine plague in 2nd and the Cyprian plague in the 3rd century AD (Ambasciano 2016). The cult of Bona Dea, however, nevertheless continued to enjoy literary discussion well into the 8th century AD, such as the Epitome of Paulus Diaconus (ca. AD 720/730-797) (Epitome s.v. Damium). Finally, the cult enjoyed worship from every facet of Roman life, ranging from the aristocratic state cult practices to that of even freedmen and slaves.

The book was somewhat famous because, despite having been written by a scholar educated in conservative al-Zaytuna mosque, it was one of the first in Tunisia to rally for women's education.

The book covers almost all of the Qur'anic dispositions regarding women, such as polygyny and testimony, from a conservative point of view that aligns with hegemonic interpretations of the times. The only topic that is portrayed under a different light is that of education. The book is filled with Qur'anic quotations as well as ahadith (Ø£Ø­Ø§Ø¯ÙØ«) to back the author's explanations of said issues and the laws related to them.

Despite the fact that the book was not too well-known (except among fellow Zaytuna scholars), it did serve as a precedent for the educational reform, particularly with regards to the inclusion of women in education. The time scope we have chosen for the present entry reflects the period from the publication of the book until the Tunisian independence because it was in 1956 that the Law of Personal Status was published. Considering the topics covered by the text at hand and those present in the aforementioned law, we believe it is safe to assume that what little influence the text at hand could possibly have had in Tunisian society and the female emancipation and educational reform debates ended after the proclamation of the law.",1890,1956,341,1229,Tatiana HernÃ¡ndez-Justo,55,Julian Weideman,2022-11-22 14:01:01.790 +0100,2022-12-24 22:21:42.203 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.001436389408412549,0.04349245456468567,2.4205253401043623e-15,0.09946488263213588,0.004850084416834748,0.6940968980955915,0.00022582137595037981,0.15643341393136986,5.557501699752987e-08
1585,Jingde chuandeng lu æ¯å¾·å³çé,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Jingde chuandenglu (Record of the Transmission of the Lamp [Compiled in] the Jingde era) was initially titled the Fozu tongcan ji ä½ç¥ååé when the Buddhist monk Daoyuan éå (ï¬. ca. 1000) presented his compilation of Chan transmission records to the Song court in 1004. Daoyuan, known as a Fayan-lineage æ³ç¼å® monk from the Chengtian Yongâan Monastery æ¿å¤©æ°¸å®é¢ in Suzhou èå·, was a disciple of Tiantai Deshao å¤©å°å¾·é¶ (891-972) who served as preceptor of the state of the Wuyue regime. It is documented that Daoyuanâs compilation adopted a multilineal framework that arranged the name of 1701 figures (52 generations predicated on the master-disciple relationship) and delineated the transmission histories from the Seven Buddhas of the Past, Indian patriarchs, and eventually, to the Fayan lineage. //
Under Emperor Zhenzongâs çå® (r. 997-1022) imperial edict, leading scholarly literati Yang Yi æ¥å (974-1020), Li Wei æç¶­ and Wang Shu çæ (963-1034) supervised the editorial work of Daoyuanâs compilation. According to the Xu zizhi tongjian changbian çºè³æ²»ééé·ç·¨, the thirty-fascicle Jingde chuandeng lu was accomplished and issued in 1009. In this current title, âJingdeâ refers to the reign title of Emperor Zhenzong, and âchuangdeng luâ represents the way that dharma was transmitted from master to disciple similar to how one lamp lights up another. In Yang Yiâs accounts, this edited compilation included the names of 1760 figures and 1169 entries. However, extant woodblock-printed editions of the Jingde chuandeng lu went through later editing and did not preserve the full text of the original records. Among varied extant editions, two main editions are the TÅji æ±å¯º edition (printed in 1080 in the Dongchan Monastery æ±ç¦ªå¯º in Fuzhou ç¦å·) and the Sibu congkan åé¨å¢å edition (issued in 1316 in the Daochang chanyou Temple éå ´ç¦ªå¹½åºµ in Huzhou æ¹å·). The standard text cited in modern scholarship came from the TaishÅ shinshu daizÅkyÅ å¤§æ­£æ°ä¿®å¤§èµçµ, which employed the Sibu congkan edition. Both the TÅji and Sibu congkan editions contain the name of 1709 people and 966 entries. //
Entries of Chan masters in the Jingde chuandeng lu include their sermons, transmission verses, poems, and dialogues with disciples. According to recent scholarship, the compilation of this work drew on earlier Chan transmission records. The multilineal style first appeared as the arrangement format of the Zutang ji ç¥å é. The list of Indian patriarchs came from the Baolin zhuan å¯¶æå³. In addition to these two collections, other extant Chan genealogical histories prior to the Jingde chuandeng lu include the Chuan Fabao ji å³æ³å¯¶ç´, the Lengqie shizi ji æ¥ä¼½å¸«è³è¨, and the Lidai Fabao ji æä»£æ³å¯¶è¨. However, the Jingde chuandeng lu was distinct from previous Chan genealogical histories as it received imperial sanction from the Song court and had its influence transcending the regional boundaries. //
In 1011, the Jingde chuandeng lu obtained Emperor Zhenzongâs permission to be incorporated into the Song Buddhist canon. Another version of this work, the fifteen-fascicle abridged version compiled by scholarly bureaucrat Wang Sui çé¨ (973-1039) and titled Chuandeng yuying ji å³ççè±é, was submitted to Emperor Renzong ä»å® (r. 1022-1063) in 1034 and granted to become an inclusion of the Buddhist canon as well. As the first work of the denglu (lamp records) genre, the Jingde chuandeng lu established a model for subsequent Chan genealogical histories sanctioned by the Song court, such as the Tiansheng guangdeng lu å¤©èå»£çé, the Jianzhong jingguo xudeng lu å»ºä¸­éåçºçé, and the Jiatai pudeng lu åæ³°æ®çé. //
Besides its impact on later genealogical histories, the Jingde chuandeng lu was also involved with the development of other genres of Chan texts. Recent studies proved that cases of Chan masters compiled in later gongâan å¬æ¡ collections were initially documented in the Jingde chuandeng lu. Similarities in language styles between denglu and yulu èªé were also discerned.//
Considering the historicity of Chan transmission records, scholars suggest that the Jingde chuandeng lu should be viewed as didactic work that served certain religious purposes. According to existing scholarship, Daoyuanâs compilation aimed at promoting the Fayan lineage. Meanwhile, Yang Yiâs editing portrayed Chan as âa separate practice outside the teachingâ to help provide a literary model that distinguished Song culture. With the effort of Chan monks and scholarly literati, the compilation of this work was influential in defining the self-identity of Chan.",1004,1004,1248,730,Yi Liu,45,Matthew Hamm,2022-11-23 01:32:55.405 +0100,2022-12-29 05:55:07.747 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.009300690418385467,0.0985431286044854,0.04020562859200134,0.2560468650766101,0.0024844550589334245,6.940193053837597e-13,0.07660076093233584,0.2875727988359129,0.22924567248064145

1589,Peshitta,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Peshitta (P) is the Syriac translation of the Bible. It consists of both the Old and the New Testament. Its translation process started already during the second century CE, and the translation itself has been used until today (This is the reason for the timeframe/2CE-21CE/ given to this article). It is only in the 9th century that this corpus was given the name 'Peshitta'. One can speak of P as both the earliest translation of biblical narratives into Syriac and a corpus reflected in the manuscript tradition. As for the first point, previous scholarship has extensively debated about the earliest date of the translation, but has never been able to clearly answer the question of its origins. The scholars basically all agree that it is impossible to determine the starting date of the translation. The answers to this question depend on the angle with which it is approached. Weitzman argued that the translation must predate the fourth-century Syriac fathers Aphrahat and Ephrem, who quoted it extensively, but cannot be later than about 200 CE because P-Gen uses a particle (yt) that Ephrem no longer understood. What can be debated, on the other hand, is the Syriac of P as attested in the manuscripts available for each biblical book and their complete compilation by the various editors. Given its textual history, the text of P is, therefore, the result of three interrelated processes. First, the initial (oral or textual) process of translating the biblical narratives. Second, the compilation of the originally translated narratives into larger units. For example, complete biblical books or liturgical readings. Third, Syriac biblical narratives attested in the manuscript tradition. In this respect, we can say that P is the title given to a collection of translated biblical texts which includes both biblical narratives and independent manuscript headings. The main characteristic of P is that it spans several centuries of use, involving multiple processes of textual interpolation that are visible in either minor or major textual differences in the manuscripts. Textual idiosyncrasies of the Peshitta reflect its rich history and importance within the Syriac tradition.
Nota bene - the region indicated here is the approx. region restricted to the first centuries of the Peshitta.  Today, it is basically used wherever there is a Syriac community, Peshitta user or scholar (and this would probably cover the whole world).
(For better understanding of this entry, I recommend you read it along with the 'Targums' and 'Septuagint' entries. Namely, Peshitta, Septuagint and Targums reflect similar methodological questions, and occasionally they can share some features).",2,21,1800,770,Srecko Koralija,18,Robyn Walsh,2022-11-28 16:29:38.906 +0100,2022-12-16 22:20:43.896 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.05885927663636867,2.055100898983673e-12,4.012399546497257e-15,0.13863804273338923,0.005135664255816201,0.6897592651918412,0.00021999393640590462,0.10738770872317686,4.8520942920922374e-08
1595,The Five Yi Yin Texts,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Five Yi Yin Texts are a group of ancient Chinese bamboo-slip manuscripts that were looted, sold to the Hong Kong Antiquites Market, and purchased by Tsinghua University in 2008.

Scholars have come to treat these five manuscripts of unknown authorship as a group, because they all focus on the exemplary relationship between Tang, the first king of Shang, and his legendary minister Yi Yin. The first two texts, *Yin zhi and *Yin gao, tell stories about Tang and Yi Yinâs conquest of Jie, the last king of Xia. They are identified by most scholars as belonging to the textual tradition of the Shang shu å°æ¸ or âExalted Scriptures.â The third text, Chi jiu, was originally bound together with *Yin zhi and *Yin gao and copied by the same scribe, but unlike the historical anecdotes in the other two texts, it is a fantastic story about magic, exorcism, and numinous animals. The last two, *Tang zai chimen and *Tang chu yu Tangqiu, were also bound together and copied by the same hand (though not the one that copied the above three). Both are philosophical dialogues between Tang and Yi Yin. While *Tang zai chimen constructs a systematic cosmology of heaven, earth, state, and person, *Tang chu yu Tangqiu centers around the virtue of the king and its political significance. Prior to the discovery of these manuscript, there were already numerous anecdotes about Yi Yin in ancient Chinese texts. As philosophers and storytellers often used him to illustrate their arguments, Yi Yin came to assume several new identities as a spy, a cook, and a dowry escort in the Warring States period.

Accordingly, they were often connected to the royal court, as well as official and religious institutions in various cities. However, exorcists were not priests. Among the tools of their trade were numerous rituals, medical remedies, prayers, and incantations. Exorcists in the Neo-Assyrian period did not distinguish between what we today label as âmagicâ and âmedicineâ, instead believing that most illnesses were caused by supernatural forces, such as gods or demons. Once a patient was seized by an illness, healing could be achieved through identifying the ailment and the agent causing the malady, and subsequently applying therapeutic or ritual treatments to cure the illness and its symptoms, as well as ritual actions to appease the god in question. Healing therefore consisted of both medical and magical treatments, and the term encapsulates the combined focus in the exorcistâs methods for diagnosing and treating illness as well as ensuring social, physical, or mental wellbeing. Although an exorcistâs duties partially overlapped with those of the physician (asÃ») and diviner (bÄrÃ»), the exorcist appears to have been the primary professional practicing a broad selection of traditional Assyrian and Babylonian healing methods in the Neo-Assyrian period. Accordingly, the translation âexorcistâ is inadequate and often incorrect in describing his competences and duties. The majority of sources from this period can be dated roughly to the 8th and 7th centuries BCE, and they were excavated in the royal text collections at Nineveh, a temple library in Kalhu (Nimrud), private libraries in Assur (especially the âHaus des BeschwÃ¶rungspriestersâ), and a private text collection from Huzirina (Sultantepe).",-900,-612,582,1132,Troels Pank ArbÃ¸ll,50,Andrew Danielson,2023-01-06 11:21:20.969 +0100,2023-01-17 13:21:21.264 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.06467256391207796,0.277739656389193,0.04842177199328256,0.01829431797373211,1.2985201803381324e-12,0.005054760015444142,0.5858169127639621,1.6950653604253445e-08,3.5599251565245985e-13

Ces investigations expriment la difficultÃ© Ã  dÃ©terminer l'auteur du livre et l'Ã©poque de sa rÃ©daction.
L'enquÃªte la plus rÃ©cente du livre est celle que Bandar Al-Zaidi a dÃ©posÃ©e dans le cadre d'un Master des Ã©tudes religieuse dans une universitÃ© saoudienne.
Avant l'enquÃªte de Bandar Al-Zaidi, on retrouve l'Ã©dition de Beyrouth avec un trÃ¨s mauvais travail de Khaled Abdel-Fattah Shebl en 2004. Avant cela, le Dr Al-Taher Bin Salama avait suggÃ©rÃ© une enquÃªte sur le livre dans le cadre de son doctorat, son ouvrage a Ã©tÃ© publiÃ© en 1998. Quant Ã  la quatriÃ¨me enquÃªte, qui est la plus ancienne, elle a Ã©tÃ© rÃ©alisÃ©e par l'orientaliste allemand Einsenberg et publiÃ©e en 1922.
Ces enquÃªtes donnent quatre exemplaires du livre d'Al-Kisa'i et sa personnalitÃ©. Chaque Ã©dition faisait rÃ©fÃ©rence Ã  un auteur et dÃ©finissait pour lui une Ã©poque diffÃ©rente des autres Ã©ditions, et fournissait un titre au livre diffÃ©rent des autres titres.
L'Ã©dition d'Eisenberg avait comme titre ""Histoires des prophÃ¨tes"" elle est attribuÃ©e Ã  Abu Hamza al-Kisa'i, le linguiste, professeur d'al-Amin et d'al-Ma'mun, dÃ©cÃ©dÃ© en 179, 180 ou 189 AH (795 , 796 CE ou 805 CE).
Le travail de at-Taher bin Salma s'intitule ""Le dÃ©but de la crÃ©ation et les histoires des prophÃ¨tes par Al-Kisa'i."" L'auteur de l'enquÃªte a suggÃ©rÃ© qu'Al-Kisa'i vivait dans le sixiÃ¨me siÃ¨cle AH (12 CE)
Le titre de la copie du Dar Al-Kutub al-'Ilmiyyah est ""Histoires et naissances des prophÃ¨tes"", elle prÃ©tend  que al-Kisa'i est mort en l'an 1234 AH (1818 AD),
Quant Ã  l'enquÃªte de Bandar Al-Zaidi, elle s'intitule ""Le livre du commencement et les histoires des prophÃ¨tes, que la paix et les bÃ©nÃ©dictions soient sur eux"", il l'attribue Ã  la mÃªme personnalitÃ© que at-Taher bin Salma, Ã  savoir Abu Bakr Muhammad bin Abdullah Al-Kisa'i, mais il prÃ©cise l'Ã©poque Ã  laquelle il a vÃ©cu entre 250 et 350 AH (864-961 CE).
La vÃ©ritÃ© est que la dÃ©claration d'Eisenberg et la prÃ©cision de Dar al-Kutub al-'Ilmiyyah sont incorrectes.
Al-Kisa'i se rÃ©fÃ¨re dans son livre, dans de nombreux cas, Ã  Ibn 'Asaker, l'auteur de l'Histoire de Damas, dÃ©cÃ©dÃ© en l'an 571 AH (1176 CE), il n'est donc pas possible que la personne visÃ©e soit al-Kisa'i Abu Hamzah le linguiste dÃ©cÃ©dÃ© avant Ibn 'Asaker de prÃ¨s de 4 siÃ¨cle. Al-Qurtubi, dans son interprÃ©tation du Coran, se rÃ©fÃ¨re au livre d'al-Kisa'i verbalement il le dit : ""Son miracle a Ã©tÃ© mentionnÃ© dans ce qu'al-Kisa'i a mentionnÃ© dans les histoires de les prophÃ¨tesâ¦ Â» Al-Qurtubi est mort en l'an 631 AH (1234 ÙÙ), il n'est donc pas possible qu'al-Kisa'i, qui nous intÃ©resse, soit celui mentionnÃ© par Dar al-Kutub al-'Ilmiyyah. Quant Ã  at-Taher bin Salma et Vadet, ils prÃ©cisent deux dates proches pour la mort de l'auteur, le Ve siÃ¨cle AH (11 CE) pour vadet et le VIe siÃ¨cle AH (12 CE) pour Bin Salma.
La pÃ©riode pendant laquelle Al-Kisa'i a vÃ©cu s'Ã©tend sur les sixiÃ¨me et septiÃ¨me siÃ¨cles, avec une forte probabilitÃ© qu'il ait vÃ©cu entre l'annÃ©e 571 AH, l'annÃ©e de la mort d'Ibn Asaker, et l'annÃ©e 617 AH , la date du plus ancien exemplaire de son livre, ce qui signifie qu'il est contemporain d'historiens et de commentateurs de premier plan, dont les plus cÃ©lÃ¨bres sont Ibn Al-Jawzi, Ibn Al-Atheer et Al-Qurtubi...
Nous pouvons en apprendre davantage sur la zone gÃ©ographique dans laquelle Al-Kisa'i a vÃ©cu en regardant les emplacements des copies manuscrites de son livre.
Ben Salma travaillait sur seize exemplaires manuscrits, tous rÃ©partis entre Tunis et Paris, cependant il attribut au dernier exemplaire, le nom de ""l'exemplaire de Damas"".
Les exemplaires de Paris sont des exemplaires originaux conservÃ©s Ã  la BibliothÃ¨que Nationale de Tunisie.
La plupart des copies de Paris ont Ã©tÃ© Ã©crites en Ã©criture orientale, ce qui suggÃ¨re fortement qu'elles ont Ã©tÃ© Ã©crites au proche orient. Bin Salama a mentionnÃ© que les copies les plus anciennes, qui ont Ã©tÃ© copiÃ©es en l'an 877 AH, ont Ã©tÃ© vues par ""Botrus Diab al-Halabi, le traducteur du sultan de France en l'an mil six cent soixante-dix chrÃ©tiens"", correspondant Ã  l'annÃ©e 1081 AH.
La plupart des copies Ã©taient associÃ©es Ã  Damas, et il n'est pas exclu en ce qui concerne le reste des copies Ã  Paris ou en Tunisie qu'elles soient originaires de Syrie en raison des relations Ã©troites que l'Empire franÃ§ais entretenait avec la Syrie et l'orient.

1653,Visigothic Homoian Christianity,43,Religious Group (v6),"Homoian (also homoean) Christians, from the ancient Greek homoios (á½Î¼Î¿Î¹Î¿Ï), meaning similar, believed that God the Father, and Christ the Son were similar in nature. This was distinct from Nicene Christianity which adhered to the view that the Father and Son were identical (homos-á½Î¼ÏÏ) in nature. The theological position of Homoianism was presented at the Councils of Ariminium and Seleucia in 359 and ratified at the Council of Constantinople in 360 CE. Homoianism was favored by the emperors Constantius II and Valens. Homoian Christianity was championed by Acacius of Caesarea (died in 365 CE) and its followers were sometimes called 'Acacians'.

Arianism is often used (erroneously) in scholarship as a synonym for Homoian Christianity (as well as other theological positions rejecting the notion that the Son and Father are of the same nature). This stems from attempts by fifth-century CE opponents to slander Homoianism through association with the Alexandrian priest Arius (c.250 or 256-336 CE), who also believed that the nature of the Son was distinct from that of the Father.

Like other instances of religious conversion in Antiquity, the adoption of Homoian Christianity amongst Goths was a gradual process rather than a punctual event. The genesis of Homoian gothic communities occurred in 341 when Ulfilas (also Wulfila, c.311-383 CE), considered the apostle of the Goths, was appointed bishop of the Homoian (or a theological position best described as Homoian) communities in Gothic-controlled lands at the Council of Antioch. This would imply that there were indeed Christians already living in this area who had requested for a bishop. These may have been the descendants of Christian, Roman prisoners. He preached to and converted Gothic communities north of the Danube until he was expelled, along with many of his followers in 347/8 due to a Christian persecution in Gothia. Ulfilas and his followers settled in Moesia, in the Roman Empire. He developed a Gothic script and translated the Bible into Gothic. Homoian Christianity received imperial patronage from the emperors Constantius II from 350-61, during his time as sole ruler of the Empire, and from Valens until his death in 378. During this time, Ulfila' Gothic followers would adopt Homoianism, understood as a compromise between so-called 'Arianism' and Nicene Christianity due to its stipulation that the nature of Christ was similar to that of the Father.

During the reign of these two emperors, two other events can be pinpointed as part of the conversion process of Goths.
In 369, a power struggle occurred within the Thervingian people between Athanaric and Fritigern. Fritigern petitioned for support from the Roman emperor Valens. The Thervingian Goths under Fritigern's command converted to Homoian Christianity and requested theological teachers.
In 376, the westward movement of the Huns and Alans encroached on Gothic land and two gothic Groups, the Thervingi and Greuthungi, requested to cross the Danube into Roman land to seek refuge. The Thervingi were allowed to cross but the Greuthungi were denied entry. Nevertheless, the Greuthungi crossed into Roman land illegally. Conversion to Homoianism was a condition for admission and would have applied to all Goths entering the Empire at this time. 

The Council of Constantinople of 381, which was summoned by emperor Theodosius I and followed the Edict of Thessalonica, condemned Arianism (and its associate theological doctrine, Homoianism). Nevertheless, the council decreed that barbarian peoples could continue to practice Homoianism in the ways that their ancestors had. Scholars such as Herwig Wolfram argue that the conversion of Goths to Homoianism would have created a sense of unity, a distinct change from the heterogenous pagan beliefs from the pre-Christian era.

The exact ethnogenesis of the Visigoths, as a sub-group of Goths and other barbarian peoples has been disputed, but it seems likely that the identity of this group solidified under the Alaric in the 390s, until their definitive settlement in Aquitaine in 419 by the Roman Empire. Homoian Christianity became deeply entrenched within the ranks of the Visigothic aristocracy. Many Homoian bishops originated from aristocratic families.
In 579, Hermenegild, the son of king Liuvigild, converted to Nicene Christianity and led a revolt in Baetica. Liuvigild called a synod in Toledo in 580 which revised Homoian beliefs to be more acceptable to Nicene Christians. These reforms would have little impact given that Homoianism had already largely lost its appeal since the 560s, if not earlier. In the second half of the sixth century, Nicene and Homoian clergy, bishops and churches would be operating in parallel in most major cities in the Visigothic Kingdom.
Homoian Christianity would be replaced by Nicene Christianity as the state-sponsored religion at the third council of Toledo, in 589, convoked by king Reccared, who had himself converted to Nicene Christianity in 587. Former Homoian bishops were allowed to keep their posts and shared their duties with their Nicene counterparts, but metropolitans lost their province-wide authority.",341,589,1869,1339,CÃ©drik Michel,49,Ian Randall,2023-02-11 18:59:53.441 +0100,2023-10-01 18:55:31.332 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),2.635229347228003e-14,1.3371862276966047e-12,0.03713231445165179,2.243997579354769e-12,0.005168494775682144,8.584861040251104e-24,0.0005429738579670972,1.4104650419921779e-11,0.9571562168969867

Au cours de l'annÃ©e 1972, un groupe d'Ã©tudiants a annoncÃ© sa propre identitÃ© politique et idÃ©ologique (religieuse), diffÃ©rente des identitÃ©s politiques et idÃ©ologiques de gauche qui dominaient l'universitÃ© Ã  l'Ã©poque. Leur signature sur les dÃ©clarations qu'ils ont Ã©mises et accrochÃ©es aux murs de l'universitÃ© ou du collÃ¨ge Ã©tait ""Ãtudiants qui font la priÃ¨re"".
Le 6 juin 1981, un groupe de personnalitÃ©s politiques et scientifiques appartenant Ã  la classe moyenne organisent une confÃ©rence de presse au cours de laquelle ils annoncent la formation d'un nouveau parti en Tunisie, l'appelant la Â«Mouvement de Tendance IslamiqueÂ» (M.T.I.).

Ce qui a poussÃ© ces personnalitÃ©s Ã  annoncer un parti Ã  tendance islamique, c'est la vague d'ouverture apparue Ã  l'horizon lorsque la figure destourienne (qui appartient au parti du pouvoir) Ã  orientation arabo-islamique et africaine a pris les rÃªnes du premier ministÃ¨re de l'Etat tunisien.
Cependant, ce parti a rapidement connu un affrontement avec l'Ãtat, qui a refusÃ© de lui accorder un visa de travail lÃ©gal et emprisonnÃ© ses dirigeants, ce qui a entraÃ®nÃ© de nouvelles figures de leadership, dont la plus cÃ©lÃ¨bre est l'ingÃ©nieur Hammadi al-Jabali.
Pendant l'Ã©tÃ© de 1987, une forte confrontation a eu lieu entre la tendance islamique et le rÃ©gime de Bourguiba. Cette confrontation s'est terminÃ©e par l'arrestation de la plupart des dirigeants historiques et de quelques dirigeants de la classe moyenne de l'organisation. La peine de mort attendait certains dirigeants, en particulier Rashid Al-Ghannouchi et le mathÃ©maticien Moncef Ben Salem.
Cependant, le coup d'Ãtat doux menÃ© par le gÃ©nÃ©ral Zine El Abidine Ben Ali a empÃªchÃ© ces peines de mort, et il semblait que la crise avec l'Ãtat se dirige vers une solution finale. Le mouvement a de nouveau cherchÃ© Ã  obtenir un visa de travail lÃ©gal et a changÃ© son nom de Â«Tendance islamiqueÂ» en Â«Mouvement NahdaÂ». 
Cependant, l'affrontement violent entre le mouvement islamique et le rÃ©gime n'a pas tardÃ©, surtout aprÃ¨s l'incendie du siÃ¨ge de l'AssemblÃ©e constitutionnelle dÃ©mocratique au pouvoir Ã  Bab Souika (l'ancien centre-ville de Tunis), qui a Ã©tÃ© menÃ©e par le mouvement Nahda, et Ã  la suite de quoi l'un des gardiens de la place est mort.
AprÃ¨s cela, le mouvement Nahda a traversÃ© des annÃ©es que ses adhÃ©rents les nomment les annÃ©es du JÃ©nocide. Jusqu'Ã  ce que la rÃ©volution du 17 dÃ©cembre 2010 au 14 janvier 2011 ait lieu. Les immigrÃ©s islamistes sont revenus en Tunisie et ils ont reformÃ© avec le reste des islamistes leur parti. Ensuite, ils ont demandÃ© un visa pour un parti lÃ©gal, qu'ils ont obtenu, et ils ont changÃ© le nom de leur parti pour devenir le Â«Parti du mouvement NahdaÂ».",1981,2023,1866,1225,Ali Makhlabi,55,Julian Weideman,2023-02-11 22:06:56.237 +0100,2024-05-15 20:04:00.637 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),7.930853178492787e-15,5.667256395521961e-13,7.606626810570087e-25,7.266788185834883e-12,0.29638080111421183,0.7036111468152033,8.052062743346819e-06,3.1170193213280573e-23,2.2004884210648392e-16
1659,The Conferences of John Cassian,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"This document was written in the 5th century by a monk named John Cassian in order to help found a monastery in the Roman-controlled region of Gaul (in modern-day France). The Conferences are the second volume of Cassian's instructions (the first volume is The Institutes) on how to correctly practice monasticism based on his experience living as a monk in Egypt. Unlike The Institutes, however, The Conferences is written as a series of conversations between a young Cassian, his monastic compatriot Germanus, and several venerable Egyptian monks.

1661,Ludlul Bel Nemeqi,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Ludlul bÄl nÄmeqi, âI will praise the lord of wisdom,â is the incipit title of a Babylonian narrative poem that recounts the divinely-imposed suffering of the poemâs protagonist, one Shubshi-meshre-Shakkan, and his divinely-effected restoration. The poem is sometimes referred to as the âBabylonian Job,â though its contents differ significantly from the biblical book. About seventy cuneiform tablets and fragments attest the poem (a number that grows every few months due to new discoveries), from which scholars have reconstructed about three-quarters of its original text. The poem likely extended to some six hundred lines in antiquity, which ancient copyists divided into five sections called âTablets.â Modern scholars number these with Roman numerals (IâV); Arabic numerals indicate line numbers within each Tablet.

The poem opens in the first-person voice of the protagonist, who praises the wrath and mercy of the Babylonian high god Marduk (I 1â40), the deity responsible for the manâs suffering and eventual recovery. In the lines immediately following the hymn the protagonist describes in a retrospective manner Mardukâs past anger toward him, which resulted in his loss of divine protectors and his reception of unfavorable signs and terrifying dreams. Expelled from his house, the protagonist recounts how he evoked the ire of his king and the jealousy of his colleagues, who schemed against him. Alienated from his community, family, and friends, the protagonist found himself completely alone; no one came to his aide. At the end of Tablet I without possessions, property, or professional position; grief-stricken, afraid, and helpless, Shubshi-meshre-Shakkan resolutely hoped for the arrival of relief. But, at the start of Tablet II, the second year of his trials, he was utterly disappointed. 

Surrounded by evil and without help from his personal deities and ritual experts, the protagonist tells how confused he was about his mistreat despite his sincere piety and ritual observances. This cognitive dissonance induced doubt in him about the knowability of the gods and elicited musings on the frailty and vacillations of human life. Giving up on such lofty and troubling thoughts, the protagonist describes a litany of demonically-delivered infirmities that plagued him, the language of which resonates strongly with lamentations and lists of symptoms in medical texts. As his condition worsened, he was confined to his bed; he gained no help from ritual specialists; and he received no mercy from his gods. At the end of Tablet II, with burial preparations and mourning complete, he tells how he awaited death.

In the first half of Tablet III, the protagonist describes (three or) four dreams (interpretations vary), in which several divine beings appeared to him, speaking a message of deliverance and healing. Mardukâs wrath was finally appeased; the high god had heard the manâs pleas for salvation. In a broken passage, it seems that the protagonist admits to his sins and acts of negligence. In the remainder of Tablet III, the ending of which is unrecovered, the protagonist describes the reversal of his infirmities, which continues into the very fragmentary and incompletely reconstructed Tablet IV. 

At the opening of Tablet V, Shubshi-meshre-Shakkan, now fully restored to health, praises Marduk, who is explicitly and emphatically referred to as the protagonistâs lord. Shubshi-meshre-Shakkan describes how after his restoration he entered the Esagil temple complex, the temple of Marduk in Babylon, to perform rituals of thanksgiving. As he entered twelve different temple gates, he received items related to his restoration (e.g., abundance, life, clear signs, release from guilt, relief of lamentation, etc.). After recounting these ritual activities at the temple, the poem leaves the protagonistâs first-person voice behind as it offers a crescendo of praise that moves from the citizens of Babylon to all of humanity. Although the conclusion to the poem, now cast in the voice of an omniscient third-person narrator, is not entirely recovered, its doxological intent is without doubt: âyour (Mardukâs) praise is sweet!â (V 120).

Ludlul bÄl nÄmeqi was a literary classic in ancient Mesopotamia. The dozens of inscribed tablets bearing the poemâs text all come from major libraries and archives in first millennium BCE cities, including Nineveh, Ashur, Kalá¸«u, Sippar, Babylon, and Kish. At least fifteen of these textual witnesses are school exercise tablets, providing evidence of the poemâs use in scribal training and enculturation. The poem was also the subject of an ancient commentary, which indicates an active interest in the poem in the middle of the first millennium. Moreover, a few of the poemâs lines are used as explanatory citations in commentaries on other texts, including one from Hellenistic Uruk (late 4th century BCE), which attests to the poemâs on-going cultural cachet. 

Many scholars believe the poem was composed in the last quarter of the second millennium, but there is currently no solid proof for this reasonable hypothesis. It was certainly composed sometime between the reign of Babylonian Kassite king Nazimaruttash (r. 1301â1277 BCE), who the poem mentions by name (in V 100 or V 101 [reconstructions vary]), and the copying of the earliest Neo-Assyrian textual witnesses (c. 9â8th century BCE). 

The author of the poem is unknown. Since, however, the poem betrays a knowledge of medical vocabulary, the incantatory and lament traditions, anti-witchcraft texts, demonology, temple ritual and geography, as well as learned scribal hermeneutics, its author was very likely a scribal scholar from the ranks of the professional exorcists.",-1300,-300,1631,1352,Alan Lenzi,58,Jennifer Singletary,2023-02-16 05:54:42.441 +0100,2023-03-08 06:58:45.071 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.02999539668836575,0.3300599196656702,5.491289574351213e-14,0.2466661982737327,0.00012578126069806694,1.9098249044411935e-13,0.28664676593187066,0.07387314775208355,0.032632790427333226

1674,New Hampshire Declaration of Faith,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The New Hampshire Declaration of Faith was the statement of faith adopted by the  Baptist State Convention of New Hampshire on January 15, 1833. It was composed by a committee including I. Pearson, B. Stow, and J. Newton Brown.

The first edition and Brown's edition included references to the Bible to explain or defend the articles. Sometimes, the Scripture references were omitted or abridged.

A significant number of Baptist churches adopted the New Hampshire Declaration as a summary statement of Baptist beliefs. Many different kinds of Baptists adopted this document as well, or modified it to fit local or institutional needs.  Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary's adoption of the New Hampshire Declaration with amendment is one example of the malleability of the Declaration.

1677,Royal Hittite Religion,43,Religious Group (v6),"Just as its contemporaries in the Late Bronze Age, Hittite state had a polytheist religion. The pantheon included hundreds of deities, which grew over time with the deities various cultures (e.g. Hattians, Palaeans, Luwians, Hurrians, etc.) that were incorporated through conquest or close contact, so much so that Hittites referred to their pantheon in general as the âThousand Gods of Hatti,â the last word being a reference to their country. While the actual number of gods and goddesses may not reach a thousand, if all divine beings, like the demons (mythological creatures, animals, mixed beings) and topographical features (mountains, rivers, springs, etc.) included, the number certainly exceeds a thousand. The top deities of the pantheon were the Sun-deities, both male and female, and the Storm-gods. Syncretism only occurred in a limited fashion in the later periods of the empire. Thus, many local gods were distinguished from similar deities, resulting in numerous variations by location, e.g. Storm God of Hatti, Storm God of Zippalanda, Storm God of Nerik, etc. The divine world was conceived as a mirror of the human world, where anthropomorphic deities were organized in a hierarchy of various families and like humans had needs to eat, sleep, and even be entertained. Temples were the houses of the deities where they inhibited an image, typically an anthropomorphic statue, but in some occasions it could also be a zoomorphic statue, a worked or unworked stele, or even a manufactured symbol, such as a golden disk for a Sun deity. Of course, such man-made objects would only be inhibited by the deities through special rituals. While the most prominent gods, the Sun-deities and the Storm-gods were responsible for the essence of life with their sun-light and waters, other deities presided over various matters like warfare, birth, death, reproduction, love, and so forth. 
Since almost all of the written documentation of Hittites originates from the administrative archives of the Hittite state, what we know of their beliefs pertains almost entirely to the official cult of the state that was headed by the king and the royal family. The king as the high priest of all the deities had a special role between the gods and the humans. He had to ensure the deities of the land were served and taken care of by the people of Hatti, so that the deities would take care of the land and the people. To that effect the state maintained numerous temples all over the land for various deities. While not many Hittite cities have been explored, at their capital city Hattusa, modern day BoÄazkale in central Turkey, ruins of over 30 temples have been unearthed. The administration ensured that temples all over Hatti were adequately staffed and maintained and the deities were properly served, which included daily ritual offerings. The temples were an extension of the state administration. They were provided by property and personnel, including slaves, to maintain their own economies, but were definitely not independent of the state. Annually, seasonally, or monthly, over a hundred religious festivals were conducted by the state cult throughout the year. The king was responsible in guiding all societal religious activities.  He and/or royal family members regularly travelled to various locations to attend the festival ceremonies. In festivals, deities are praised, provided with offerings, entertained with singers, dancers, and even sports activities, and in some instances the images of the deities were paraded in processions giving the public a rare opportunity to view them, who normally remained in the inner sancta of the temples accessible only to a select few. To oversee his duties properly, the king had to communicate with the gods, which was accomplished through various divinatory methods, such as extispicy, augury, lot oracles, dream incubation, or by interpreting unsolicited omens. Cultic specialists were experienced with numerous rituals that were performed for rite de passage like birth, puberty, marriage, death, or to treat illnesses and ailments. The funerals of the royal family involved cremation of the body. The dead kings and other royal family members were believed have âbecome gods,â and passed into the divine domain for a pleasant afterlife.",-1650,-1180,1884,1019,Tayfun Bilgin,50,Andrew Danielson,2023-02-28 03:53:30.873 +0100,2023-05-09 06:34:50.329 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.0073223216129651965,6.108378719817925e-10,1.6312785858482477e-15,0.0010263970367093013,1.3252953863727772e-25,6.752295199093373e-14,0.9916512803914659,3.479526255224057e-10,2.4514169698202902e-21

1688,Arianism,43,Religious Group (v6),"Arianism has been used as a term to designate theological beliefs attributed to Arius (c.250-336 CE), a Christian priest from Alexandria. Ariusâ written works survive only in fragments, making it difficult to reconstruct his beliefs. This is only complicated by countless attempts made by Ariusâ opponents to distort and ridicule his theological views.

 The most distinctive feature of Arianism is the relationship of the Son, Christ, to the Father, God. God, the Father, has absolute priority over all else, including the Son. According to Arius, the superiority of God, the Father, over Christ, the Son, was expressed by familial hierarchy according to which the Father was superior to the Son. Christ was begotten by God as a product of His will. Consequently, there was a time when Christ did not exist. As a creature of God, Christ cannot comprehend the nature of God, nor his own nature, but can lead others towards the worship of the one God.
Arius' theological beliefs brought him into conflict with Alexander of Alexandria (250-326 or 328 CE), who supported the Origenâs view of the eternal coexistence of the Father and the Son. Arius travelled to North Africa and the Near East and gained the support of other bishops, such as Eusebius of Caesarea and Eusebius of Nicomedia, who also believed that Alexanderâs stance jeopardized the unity of God and the primacy of the God-Father.
The emperor Constantine summoned the Council of Nicaea in 325 CE and its debate generated the belief that Christ was coeternal and of the 'same substance' (á½Î¼Î¿Î¿ÏÏÎ¹Î¿Ï-homoousios, composed of á½Î¼ÏÏ-homÃ³s, 'same' and Î¿á½ÏÎ¯Î±-ousÃ­a, 'substance') as God. 
This council consequently deemed Ariusâ beliefs as heretic and he, along with two bishops who refused to accept the outcome of the council, were sent into exile. Constantineâs decision to invite bishops throughout the Empire to condemn Arius' beliefs helped to cement a precedent according to which imperial intervention could summon councils to maintain the unity of the Christian church, and by extension, the Roman Empire.
However, the Council of Nicaea would not resolve the conflict over Arianism. Arius was recalled from exile by Emperor Constantine in 328, and invited to return to Alexandria, but prevented from reintegrating the community of the Egyptian Church by Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria (296 or 298-373 CE). Arius was reinstated in 335 and even accepted the tenets of Nicene creed when examined by Constantine at a council in Constantinople in early 336.
Arius died in 336 before he could return to Alexandria. When Arius died, Constantine considered his beliefs orthodox. Sources from the late fourth and fifth centuries generated gruesome accounts of Ariusâ death. A bitter critic, Socrates Scholasticus, wrote that Arius shamefully died from an intestinal hemorrhage, a fitting punishment for his heretic views.
The narratives that âArianismâ was characterized by a coherent set of beliefs and that âAriansâ were a defined groups with shared beliefs and continuity over times are a fantasy. The term 'Arian' was never used by its adherents but was rather employed to slander the beliefs of individuals deemed heretics, who may not even have practiced any beliefs held by Arius himself. The Homoian beliefs of emperors Constantius II, Valens, the Goths (and later Ostrogoths, Visigoths) as well as Anomoeans (also called Eunomians) were stigmatized as heretics by their opponents through the label of 'Arian'. 
Arianism (and its associate theological doctrine, Homoianism) was once again condemned in the Edict of Thessalonica (27 February 380) and at the Council of Constantinople of 381, summoned by emperor Theodosius I. Nevertheless, at the turn of the fifth century, scholars believe that Homoian Christians would have composed a majority in Constantinople.",325,671,2006,1339,CÃ©drik Michel,49,Ian Randall,2023-03-13 18:06:33.369 +0100,2023-10-01 18:52:07.566 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.0003036857640932551,0.026341806773536147,1.778897188823537e-15,0.033433137816339595,0.00013187420492354575,2.2090623598624163e-12,6.549260936274293e-05,0.9113341694201208,0.02838983340941306

1690,Christianity in Byzantium: between the end of Iconoclasm and the Schism,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Council of Constantinople that the Byzantine regent Theodora summoned in 843 convened to refute iconoclasm and restore the worship and the veneration of the Holy Icons, marking the end of Iconoclasm, which caused several serious problems to the Byzantine empire in both religious and political level. However, albeit the period after iconoclasm was generally peaceful, it was not entirely tranquil, since the iconoclastic controversy left behind a legacy of factions. Patriarch Methodius I (843-847) accommodated former iconoclasts in the Church, provided that they renounce their heretic views. Methodiusâs policy met strong opposition by the monks of the Studios monastery in Constantinople, many of which were excommunicated by Methodius before his death in 847. An intense struggle for succession has begun until Empress Theodora appointed St. Ignatius, the son of the Emperor Michael I Rangabe and opponent of Iconoclasm, to succeed Methodios. St. Ignatius was fervently accused by his enemies that, since he had not been elected in a synod and subsequently confirmed by the Emperor, but he was being appointed by the Empress Theodora, he was not a legitimate patriarch. Furthermore, St. Ignatius soon became involved in the conflict between the monks of the Stoudion monastery and the moderates in the Church. This dispute was about whether to depose clergymen who had cooperated with iconoclast policies in the past or not. Ignatius took the side of the conservative Stoudite monks and deposed the archbishop of Syracuse, Gregory Asbestas (844-880), the leader of the moderate party. Asbestas protested in 853 to Pope Leo IV (847-855) seeking a redress. Thus, a period of friction in relations between the Church of Rome and that of Constantinople had begun: Asbestas and several other bishops had been condemned in a synod called by St. Ignatius without papal consent. These events were the beginning for the so-called Photian schism. The schism was initially caused due to political reasons. Michael III (the so-called Drunkard) became emperor at a young age, while his mother Theodora served as regent. His uncle Bardas, Theodoraâs brother, was an influential advisor. However, he found a fervent critic in the face of St. Ignatius: Bardas was accused of committing incest with his daughter-in-law, therefore St. Ignatius publicly denied him the Eucharist in the Hagia Sophia. Consequently, St. Ignatius lost support and he was forced to resign in 858. He was replaced by the layman Photius. Photius became a monk on December 20, 858 and on the following four days was successively ordained lector, sub-deacon, deacon and priest. He was made patriarch on Christmas day. St. Ignatiusâs supporters however sought the aid of Pope Nicholas I (858â867). The Pope was angered by Byzantine missions among the Bulgars, whom he regarded as belonging to his juristiction. Nicholas wrote to the Bulgarians accusing the Greeks and Photius replied by accusing the Western Chruch of heretically altering the creed in saying that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and from the Son (Filioque). He declared Pope Nicholas deposed in 867. When the new emperor, Basil I the founder of the Macedonian dynasty, rose to the Byzantine throne, he reinstated St. Ignatius while Pope Nicholasâs successor (869) Adrian II, condemned Photius. But when St. Ignatius passed away, Photius quietly became patriarch again. Hence a schism occurred, which is called the Photian schism. The schism was mostly about whether the Church of Rome possessed monarchical power of jurisdiction over all churches, or whether it was the senior of the five Patriarchates and therefore could not canonically interfere with the internal affairs of another Patriarchate. The mutual distrust shown in the time of Photius erupted again in the middle of the 11th century, after papal enforcement of Latin customs upon Greeks in southern Italy. The patriarch of Constantinople, Michael Cerularius (1043 - 1059), closed Latin churches in Constantinople as a reprisal. Cerularius quarreled with Pope Leo IX over church practices in which the Roman Church differed from Constantinople, particularly the use of unleavened bread in the Eucharist. Dissenting opinions were also exchanged over other theological and cultural issues, ranging from the issue of papal supremacy in the Church to the filioque clause and other disagreements between the patriarchates. Cardinal Humbert of Silva Candida (or Humbert of Moyenmoutier) came from Italy to protest, was accorded an icy reception, and left a bull of excommunication (July 16, 1054) on the altar of the great church of Hagia Sophia. The bull anathematized (condemned) Michael Cerularius, the Greek doctrine of the Holy Spirit, the marriage of Greek priests, and the Greek use of leavened bread for the Eucharist. These events caused the East-West Schism and led to the end of the alliance between the Byzantine emperors and the Popes. Later Popes allied with the Normans against the Byzantine Empire.",843,1054,1893,1170,Lampros Alexopoulos,49,Ian Randall,2023-03-15 09:29:26.118 +0100,2023-03-22 10:03:04.959 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.000144404190391702,0.012950495088093155,0.004025600335928723,0.9447643680155478,0.03801009774030019,5.1972809574352684e-12,9.941059122148736e-05,2.9588051072736435e-12,5.624030361061098e-06
1694,Christianity in Byzantium: Between the Schism and the Fourth Crusade,43,Religious Group (v6),"Even after the schism of 1054, there were still friendly relations between the Eastern and the Western Churches. The two parts of Christendom were not yet conscious of a great gulf of separation between them in many respects, such as them (a) ecclesiological dimension of the EastâWest schism which revolved around the authority of bishops within their diocesesÂ and the lines of authority between bishops of different dioceses. It is common for Catholics to insist on theÂ primacy of Roman and papal authorityÂ based on patristic writings and conciliar documents. (b) The papal privilege and authority, (c) theological issues such as the filioque, (d) Original sin, free will and the Immaculate Conception etc. There was no single event that marked the breakdown. Rather, the two churches slid into and out of schism over a period of several centuries, punctuated with temporary reconciliations. When Emperor Alexios Komnenos asked some thirty years after the schism whether a canonical decision had been made to break relations with Rome, the participants of the synod of the Church of Constantinople refused. 
In the 11th century the Empire experienced a major disaster. Most of its heartland territory in Anatolia was lost to the Seljuk Turks following the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. At the same time, the empire lost its last territory in Italy to the Norman Kingdom of Sicily and faced repeated attacks in the Balkans. However, a period of secure dynastic rule begun by the Komnenos dynasty, under Alexios I (1081-1118), John II Komnenos (1118-43) and Manuel I Komnenos (1143-1180). These emperors were able to partially restore the empire's fortunes, but they never were able to fully reverse the damage caused by the instability at the end of the 11th century, nor return the empire's frontiers to those of 1071. After the battle of Mantzikert and the civil war that followed, Alexios I Komnenos rose to the throne and had call to the West for help, which led to the First Crusade. However, economic concessions to the Italian republics of Venice and Genoa weakened the empire's control over its own finances, while tensions with the West led to the Sack of Constantinople by the forces of the Fourth Crusade in 1204 and the dismemberment of the empire.",1054,1204,1897,1170,Lampros Alexopoulos,49,Ian Randall,2023-03-22 19:55:54.027 +0100,2023-04-06 10:59:17.169 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),1.0118430114858497e-16,1.169076616130016e-13,0.03425433192318225,0.869300427935813,0.09643711353313579,4.221344619253494e-13,1.7646306509235236e-06,1.8726975582847458e-23,6.361976678910193e-06
1695,"Xiaojing ""Classic of Filial Piety""",52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Throughout the history of imperial China, members of the political elite have held the Xiaojing å­ç¶ (Classic of Filial Piety) in high esteem.  During the Eastern Han (A.D. 25-220), every government school had a lecturer on this text.  Emperors often expounded on the classic, ordered that commentaries be written for it, and had the scripture engraved in stone.  One emperor, Emperor Tang Xuanzong åçå® (r. 712-756), even penned a commentary on it himself.   During the Northern Song åå® (960-1127), the dynastyâs two greatest statesmen, Wang Anshi çå®ç³ (1021-1086) and Sima Guang å¸é¦¬å (1019-1086), who were enemies, each wrote a treatise favoring a different version of the text.  When northerners conquered China, the Xiaojing was one of the first books they translated into their native language.  The Xiaojing quickly made its way to Japan, Korea, and Vietnam, where it became essential reading for the upper class.  

Ironically, two of the features that made the Xiaojing philosophically shallow, but culturally important were its brevity and simplicity.  It is only 1800 Chinese characters long; moreover, it repeatedly uses the same 388 characters.  Thus, one merely had to learn 400 characters to be able to read the text.  This meant that it was very easy to learn and memorize, which made it one of the first texts that a student would read in trying to master the classical language.  This guaranteed that the Xiaojing was widely known and easily distributed.  Its simple language also meant that it could. serve as both a primer and a catechism.  Hence, in medieval China, the Xiaojing was the first true book that a student would study.  In fact, in pre-modern East Asia, nearly any person who was educated in literary Chinese was almost certainly familiar with this text.  During the Tang (618-907) and the Northern Song (960-1127), civil service examination candidates had to study this work.  From the Southern Song (1127-1279), the text lost its valence among male members of the upper class; instead, it was used to educate children, women, and farmers.  In the late Ming (1368-1643), it once again found importance among male literati, particularly thinkers who emphasized the unity of the Three Religions (Sanjiao he yi ä¸æåä¸).  These men emphasized the workâs religious aspects, especially its abilities to bring about response from the spirits (gantong shenming æéç¥æ).  During the Qing (1644-1911), the Xiaojing once again came into vogue and became a text that had to be memorized for taking the civil service examinations.

Given its title, one would expect the text to say much about what it is and how one should practice filiality.  Interestingly though, the Xiaojing says little about the particulars of being filial.  Clearly then, it was not meant as a handbook on the practice of this virtue.  The Xiaojingâs most significant insight is that oneâs obligations to the family and the state are the same and not mutually exclusive.  In other words, the Xiaojing attempts to resolve the dilemma between whether one should be loyal to his family or the state.  It does so by unequivocally maintaining that no such conflict exists. That is because filial sons cannot but be loyal retainers.  The text stakes this claim on three ideas: 1. That filiality naturally becomes loyalty.  2.  Sons can only complete their filiality by serving as officials.  And 3. how one acts in the home will automatically become how one acts within the state.  Another way in which the text indicates that a son must be a loyal servitor is by maintaining that official service is needed to complete filiality.  Taking care of oneâs parents, when they are alive and after their death, is critically important; nevertheless, according to the Xiaojing, these acts still do not completely realize filiality.  That can only be done by glorifying their memory.  The best way to do this is by perfecting oneâs conduct and serving in public office.  Serving in government is a surefire way of bringing honor to their names.  

Another significant theme that the Xiaojing advocates is filialityâs metaphysical significance.  According to the text, filial piety is not merely one amongst many virtues.  It is the foundational virtue from which all others issue.  Even more importantly, it is not merely a secular virtue: it is a metaphysical principle that links people with Heaven and Earth, i.e. the universe.  In short, due to filialityâs metaphysical importance, if a ruler devotes his attention to it, he can gain supernatural protection for both his person and his state.  Consequently, during the early medieval period and the late Ming, the Xiaojing was a holy text that could be used to cure illnesses, obtain religious merit, repel evil spirits, and even enemy armies.",-230,1911,1898,671,Keith Knapp,45,Matthew Hamm,2023-03-23 02:42:44.262 +0100,2023-05-19 19:10:47.633 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.9883794891012287,0.011067118929322951,1.1758469862818669e-14,1.0851147721452887e-09,1.0757766190680097e-05,0.0005426331159919625,2.1382438876876967e-12,8.62028789734612e-16,7.844425852049942e-31
1697,Stylite Monks,43,Religious Group (v6),"Stylites were Christian monks who followed in the tradition of the 5th century saint Symeon Stylites the Elder. Symeon, after enduring many years of asceticism on the ground, began living atop high, narrow columns in modern-day Syria. These columns restricted the movement of the saint, so that he could practice an even more rigorous asceticism than he could on the ground, and they allowed the saint to remain more withdrawn from society. Other monks began imitating Symeon almost immediately, and a number of monks still live atop columns today. The highest concentration of stylite monks remained in Syria, but stylites were also present in other regions, such as Cappadocia and Georgia, and numerous stylite saints were recorded in the Byzantine capital, Constantinople. Various saintsâ lives (hagiographies) attach symbolic meaning to the columns used by stylite saints. Most notably, they may have symbolized the upward movement of monks towards the celestial paradise. Stylites sometimes had a role in affairs on the secular ground, as well, and their spiritual authority was often transferred to social or even political power. For example, Symeon Stylites the Elder once solved a conflict between Theodoret of Cyrus, an important theologian and historian, and the patriarch of Antioch. In Constantinople and the surrounding areas towards the end of the 5th century, the emperor Leo I was a regular visitor of the stylite Daniel, who became, therefore, the spiritual advisor to the political head of state. Later, especially starting in the late 6th century and early 7th century, stylite monks  offered their voices to heated debates between Chalcedonian christians and monophysites, particularly Antiochian stylites, often siding with the latter.",450,1450,1626,1400,Elizabeth Zanghi,49,Ian Randall,2023-03-24 13:48:25.824 +0100,2023-10-07 17:04:58.515 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.005219780138009127,0.9735081240372065,5.937530649891354e-16,0.01501768057936994,3.791783660393985e-15,7.279953142179605e-13,0.006254025067471966,3.9017691416413703e-07,2.959146190039463e-13
1700,The Book of Hosea,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The book of Hosea is one of the prophetic books of the Hebrew Bible, and the first book of the Minor Prophets as listed in the Masoretic text and the Septuagint. The book of Hosea featured prominently in the Qumran community, as three manuscripts of Hosea were found at Qumran (4Q78-79, 4Q82) as well as fragments of a âPesher Hoseaâ (4Q166-167). The book contains 14 chapters, the first of which offer a narrative account of the prophet Hosea followed by poetic oracles and sayings attributed to him. Hosea was a northern prophet who, according to the superscription in 1:1, operated in the Northern Kingdom around the time leading up to its fall in 722 BCE. Although much of the book focuses on the 8th century Northern Kingdom, the book also includes references to Judah that likely reflect a later historical period. References to the nation of Judah and allusions to its fall in 586 BCE lead scholars to conclude that the book of Hosea was likely composed over a long period of time, beginning with the 8th century prophetic sayings, and continuing into the 6th century and beyond, as those words became reinterpreted for a primarily Judean exilic and post exilic audience. In reception history, the book of Hosea is most well-known for its coinage of the âmarriage metaphor.â In the opening chapter of the book, Yahweh commands Hosea to take Gomer, a woman of zonah, often translated âwhoredom,â as his wife. This troubled marriage is meant to reflect the fracturing relationship between Yahweh, the husband, and his wife, Israel. While the marriage metaphor is only loosely operative in the chapters following Hosea 1-3, later biblical authors such as Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Paul of the New Testament take up and expand the metaphor in their later writings (Jeremiah 1-3, Ezekiel 16 and 23, Romans 9). Moreover, Jewish and Christian commentators later interpreted the relationship of the couple in the Song of Songs in light of the marriage metaphor, leading them to liken the young couple to Yahweh and Israel, or Christ and the church. In recent scholarship, the marriage metaphor has been addressed by feminist scholars who point out the issues, theologically, politically, and socially, with the way the marriage metaphor depicts woman as a stand-in for sin, infidelity, and impurity. The disturbing imagery and implications of this metaphor serve the rhetorical efforts of the prophet, who sought to emphasize the fractured nature of Israelâs relationship with its god, Yahweh.",-800,-500,1901,1380,Morganne Ottobre,50,Andrew Danielson,2023-03-25 18:46:45.484 +0100,2023-03-25 18:53:26.857 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.003747514768613095,7.187669278981212e-09,2.630593878841791e-14,0.14831274754317364,5.345518248571396e-15,1.4597235933553853e-22,0.013596077347291782,0.8058555503076023,0.028488102845618254
1701,The Premonstratensian Order in the Middle Ages,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Premonstratensians are a reformed monastic order which emerged in northern France in the first quarter of the twelfth century. From the mother abbey of PrÃ©montrÃ©, which was established under the leadership of Norbert of Xanten (c. 1075-1134) and Hugues of Fosses (c. 1093-1164), the order spread widely across Europe during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The Premonstratensians observed the Rule of St Augustine, with significant influence from the Cistercian Order in terms of their mode of life and internal governance. The male members of the order were canons; while in some parts of Europe such as France, they often practiced a more contemplative form of life, in other regions they were frequently involved in pastoral care and preaching. In what is today northeastern Europe and western Poland, they played a prominent role in the conversion of peoples there to Christianity. Women were prominent members of the order in the first two centuries or so of its existence. They generally referred to themselves as âsistersâ rather than as âcanonessesâ, however. Premonstratensian communities were organized in a number of circaries, roughly equivalent to ecclesiastical provinces.",1120,2023,1902,1418,Yvonne Seale,39,Janine Larmon Peterson,2023-03-25 22:11:41.671 +0100,2023-07-09 01:36:49.308 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.0003036857640932551,0.026341806773536147,1.778897188823537e-15,0.033433137816339595,0.00013187420492354575,2.2090623598624163e-12,6.549260936274293e-05,0.9113341694201208,0.02838983340941306
1703,Arsenites,43,Religious Group (v6),"On Christmas 1261 the Byzantine emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos had his eleven-year-old co-emperor John IV Laskaris blinded (thus losing the ability to claim the throne), exiled and imprisoned in Bithynia. This action led to Michaelâs excommunication by the patriarch Arsenios and, subsequently, to the Arsenite schism. Three years after his excommunication, the emperor deposed and exiled Arsenios, and in 1266 he enthroned Germanos III at the patriarchate. As a result, the former patriarchâs supporters, the Arsenites, who considered his deposition uncanonical, refused to recognise any of the following patriarchs, considering their election invalid and illegal, and broke away from the church, remaining loyal to Arsenios and the Laskarids. This is why the movement was more influential in Asia Minor, while its social character should also be noted, as it mainly represented the lower social strata that had been favoured by Theodore II Laskaris, along with its political motives, since the Arsenites opposed Michaelâs usurpation of the throne, his indifference to the eastern provinces, and his ecclesiastical, economic and pro-aristocratic policy, alongside his role in the patriarchâs enthronement and the extent to which an emperor could intervene in ecclesiastical affairs.

Germanos soon resigned and was replaced by Joseph I who lifted Michaelâs excommunication, causing a conflict between his supporters, the Josephites, and the Arsenites. After Andronikos II, Michaelâs son, succeeded to the throne, he deposed the current unionist patriarch Bekkos and reinstated Joseph, thus giving control of the ecclesiastical affairs to the Josephites and at the same time embittering the Arsenites. Although they presented a greater threat though, Joseph had crowned Andronikos co-emperor, and therefore questioning the legality of his election would be impossible. After his death in 1283, Andronikos tried to compromise the two factions by choosing the scholar Gregory II of Cyprus for the patriarchate, thinking he would be accepted by both of them; both sides though opposed him, while the Arsenites were disappointed and felt deceived by the emperor.

During Gregoryâs tenure, an effort was made to reconcile the two parties and bring the Arsenites, whose power had grown, back into the official church. In 1284 Andronikos convoked a church synod at Atramyttion, where it was eventually decided that it was up to God to judge which of them should rule the church by casting into a fire two volumes, each containing their opinions, and considering the one that would not be burnt the worthiest. As both were immediately burnt though, the two parties were temporarily appeased and agreed to accept Gregory. The following day though some of the most adamant Arsenites regretted this. As the members of the movement were divided into two groups, with the leading one emphasising its religious character and wishing to eventually gain positions in the church, and the majority of the members being interested in punishing those they considered to have sinned and prioritising a political opposition to the Palaiologoi, the emperor approached the former, and they agreed to accept the jurisdiction of the patriarchate of Constantinople on the condition that all the ordinations made by Bekkos would be annulled and those who had persecuted the Arsenites would be deposed.

At the same time, the Arsenite movement had grown in Constantinople and its political nature was strengthened as it spread within the city, where anti-Latin and anti-Unionist sentiments prevailed and the people were also faced with heavy taxation and state arbitrariness, something that made their turn to the Arsenites, who were leading the social struggles of the time, easier. According to a letter to the emperor by the patriarch, they could freely gather in public places and propagate their ideas, convert new members even by force and defy the official churchâs rules. It seems that the party had gradually become one of simple opposition to the Palaiologoi and the official church, a religious, political and social movement that would often participate in riots and anti-government conspiracies. Andronikos however kept trying to reunite them, but they argued that they should take control of the church in order to cleanse it, as they had never been excommunicated, and that if their leader became patriarch, they would return to the official church. Subsequently, the emperor allowed them to bring the body of Arsenios in Constantinople in order to rebury it with the honours appropriate for a patriarch, granted them the monastery of Mosele and later visited John Laskaris in Asia Minor and ameliorated his living conditions. The Arsenites though were still not satisfied, and in 1289 they contributed to Gregoryâs resignation, again hoping that one amongst them would be elected. Nevertheless, their demands, which included the election of a patriarch from their ranks, the removal of Josephâs name from the diptychs, the restoration of orthodoxy and the cancellation of previous excommunications, were so extreme that Andronikos could not accept them, and finally chose the monk Athanasios to be the next patriarch.

The emperor was again under the impression that the latter would be accepted by both parties, but the Arsenites felt discontent, while Athanasios was also intransigent in dealing with them. He soon became very unpopular and abdicated in 1293. His successor was the more compromising monk John XII Kosmas, who, however, was also received with opposition, came into conflict with the emperor and eventually resigned in 1303. Andronikos negotiated with the Arsenites in order to appoint a patriarch they would approve, and they nominated an elderly bishop who had been ordained while Arsenios was patriarch and urged the emperor to overlook some of his irregularities since he had not taken part in any religious scandal. Although he initially agreed, he soon recalled Athanasios to the patriarchate because he was impressed by his prophetic abilities and because he wanted him to get an earlier implied anathema lifted, leaving the Arsenites feeling deceived once again.

However, Athanasiosâ attitude towards the Arsenites had not changed, and therefore Andronikosâ attempts to reunite them with the Byzantine church failed. In 1304 he called their leaders to a synod where he blamed them for dividing both the church and the society despite all his efforts and good will, and stated that since they did not question the doctrine, they had to obey the official hierarchy. Although some Arsenites claimed that they were only interested in the official churchâs purification and insisted that it was heretical because of its common liturgy with the Westerners, Andronikos asked them to return to the church and warned them that otherwise the responsibility for the schism would fall solely on them. However, they were not convinced and the council ended without an agreement. Eventually, the emperor decided that in order to end the controversy he had to replace Athanasios with a more compromising patriarch. In September 1309 the latter resigned, and in 1310, after lengthy negotiations with the Arsenites, he was replaced by Niphon.

By that time the Arsenites had been weakened due to the loss of many territories, and therefore followers, in Asia Minor, and wished to return to the official church as they had realised that their opposition to it was leading nowhere. Since both Andronikos and Niphon also wanted to heal the schism, the Arsenites presented their terms which included repudiation of any other dogma, cancellation of earlier excommunications, removal of any members of the clergy that had practiced simony and of those that had been ordained by Bekkos, removal of Josephâs name from the diptychs, and guarantee that neither John XII nor Athanasios would be allowed to become patriarchs again. As they did not insist on their demand for the election of one of their number to the patriarchate, they indirectly recognised the legitimacy of the ecclesiastical hierarchy and the Palaiologan dynasty, a great relief for the emperor, who, until then, always had to take them into account whenever he made a political decision. The settlement took place in 1310 during a ceremony at Hagia Sophia, where Arseniosâ corpse was brought and set up, dressed in patriarchal clothes and holding a document, according to which his excommunications were revoked, and the terms of their agreement, which Andronikos approved for the sake of ecclesiastical peace, were confirmed. The most intransigent among the Arsenites and the followers of the official church disagreed, while some of the former were again separated because they did not get the offices they wanted and which had been promised to them by Niphon; any reactions however were not taken into account. Thus, after forty-five years, the Arsenite schism that had divided both church and society and embodied religious, political and social phenomena, was resolved, and at the same time a danger to the church and the state was eliminated.",1265,1310,1904,1383,Phoebe Georgiadi,49,Ian Randall,2023-03-27 13:09:34.809 +0200,2023-03-27 13:12:57.337 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.000770037559522238,0.05468844603350541,0.01456769694605577,0.19160499432082614,0.2557626051620723,0.3732210679229347,0.000334665768924408,0.10904948548542033,1.000800738699329e-06
1705,The Historia Compostellana,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Historia Compostellana is an episcopal biography (or gesta) of the twelfth-century bishop (and later archbishop) Diego GelmÃ­rez (c.1070-1140). It is also the foundation history for the bishopric of Santiago de Compostela, a city in the north-western corner of the Iberian Peninsula. It was written between 1109-1148 and covers the years 1088-1139.

The Historia Compostellana posits Diego GelmÃ­rez as the cityâs patron and protector, narrating how the bishop successfully overcame the challenges of his time. It details: the political and cultural zenith of medieval Santiago de Compostela, the cityâs place within the multipolar conflicts of twelfth-century Iberia, Church reform, Christian expansion into Andalusian lands, investiture disputes, and the rise of the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage phenomenon and the cult of St James.

The Historia Compostellana is also a foundational document for the episcopal seat of Santiago de Compostela, establishing a new canonical history for the city and the see. In creating this history, the workâs compilers invented, destroyed, and synthesised pre-existing history. Their intention was to forge a new past, one congenial to the contemporary needs of the city and its see. The result was a foundation myth that ideologically aligned Santiago de Compostela with Rome, while also burying certain inconvenient historical truths.

With respect to genre, the Historia Compostellana is a serial record, that is, a dynamic compendium of narrative texts and archival documentation that uses texts from a broad range of genres in order to narrate and evidence an historical account.

Commissioned by Bishop Diego himself, the Historia Compostellana was written in three phases and by three of his acolytes, namely, Munio Alfonso, Gerald of Beauvais, and Pedro Marcio, all of whom held senior positions within Santiago de Compostelaâs cathedral chapter at different times. Each of these compilers worked with distinct editorial visions and within different socio-political contexts. As such, the final product has a polyphonic quality that at times borders on incoherence.

The Historia Compostellana also has an explicit three book structure Â¬â a structure that does not line up with the breaks in authorship Â¬â with the first book covering the years prior to Compostelaâs elevation to the archiepiscopate in 1120, the second detailing Diegoâs glory years, and the third recounting his senescence and demise.

Along with works such as the Codex Callixtinus and the Tumbo A, the Historia Compostellana represents the literary efflorescence of Santiago de Compostelaâs medieval golden cultural age.",1088,1148,1906,1415,James Kawalek,39,Janine Larmon Peterson,2023-03-28 17:05:53.119 +0200,2023-04-02 02:56:58.252 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),6.555056792908852e-15,1.262112800879339e-12,2.6864902002472678e-14,0.8786374134270704,1.9889155606965507e-05,4.379371211548715e-13,4.082454386818627e-05,2.248848238469394e-11,0.1213018728492326

1714,Syncretic Polytheism in Curious Pastimes LARP,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Algaia is a fictional alliance of three polities (Estragales, Franconia, and Lyonesse) united by a shared religion, which exists in the game-world of Curious Pastimes, a Live Action Role-Play setting. Live Action Role-Play (LARP) is a hobbyist activity in which participants physically embody original fictional characters in a collaboratively imagined environment. These environments can reproduce existing intellectual properties, such as Middle-earth of the world of the Witcher games, or be original. Curious Pastimes is an original medievalist, high fantasy setting.

Curious Pastimes is set in an unnamed world which contains a number of nations, polities distinguished by customs, practices and religion. The Algaia is an alliance of three such nations. The Algaia people are known as more zealous than others, worshipping the Goddess, the Hunter, and the Forgeborn, three gods who oversee the Sacred Cycle, the Algaiaâs conception of life, death, and rebirth.

The Sacred Cycle and the gods are inspired in part by modern alternative spiritualities derived from Wicca, in part by Hindu concepts of Samsara and Karma. The Goddess and the Hunter resemble, respectively, the Triple Goddess (a maternal universal nature-deity), and the Horned God (a chthonic figure and avatar of wilderness). The Forgeborn, an agender deity of crafting and change, has no readily recognisable analogues. The Sacred Cycle holds that all life stems from the Goddess, is shaped by the Forgeborn, and upon death is gathered by the Hunter. The Hunter returns souls to the Goddess for her to decide if and how they are to be reborn. A Nirvana-like state of removal from the cycle is imagined, but not explored.

Algaia worshippers propitiate the gods through sacrifice, ritual, and involvement in various religious structures. The gods interact with the worshippers directly or through chosen representatives, meting out blessings and punishments.

While the Algaia religion exists in the fictional setting of Curious Pastimes LARP, its adherents frequently report having meaningful spiritual experiences. Adherents acknowledge these experiences to reside in the frame of fiction, but to also have a lasting impact on them beyond the space of the game. Thus, the gods are accepted by some players to exist fluidly between the fiction of the game and the larger world beyond it.",2019,2022,1915,1401,Anna Milon,40,Stephen Christopher,2023-04-07 10:38:55.995 +0200,2024-04-23 10:19:08.150 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.09138783918524933,6.048395845809183e-09,5.088956310964908e-24,1.862210427003462e-11,1.8523742381342178e-13,1.7501392676682986e-21,0.9086121545885792,2.9384207803756097e-11,1.2958409425802555e-10
1721,Tell Fekheriyeh Inscription,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Tell Fekheriyeh is an archeological site identified as the ancient city of Sikan (located in modern day Syria); an Aramean city thought to be an important cult site for the storm god Hadad. Sikan (and neighboring sites) fell under Neo-Assyrian control around the first half of the 9th century BCE. In February 1979, the Tell Fekheriyeh statue was discovered accidentally by a farmer in the southwest corner of Tell Fekheriyeh and today the statue stands at the National Museum of Damascus. Although the precise date of the statue is debated, most scholars agree the statue most likely dates around the late 9th or early 8th centuries BCE. The Tell Fekheriyeh statue was carved from basalt and depicts a life-size man, standing roughly 1.65 meters tall. Inscriptions on the statue identify the man as Had-Yithi, an Aramean governor/king. To the untrained eye (aka non-art historians) the iconography and style of the statue appears to be firmly Neo-Assyrian. While there are some strong connections between the styles, there are some distinct variations that differentiate the Tell Fekheriyeh statue from statues we find in the heart of the Neo-Assyrian Empire (compare the 9th century statues of Ashurnasirpal II and Shalmaneser III). The man at Tell Fekheriyeh is carved with curly shoulder-length hair and a long curly beard. He is wearing a short-sleeve tunic with a fringe shawl that comes over his left shoulder and tucks into a fringe belt at his waist. The bottom of his tunic is lined with a similar fringe on the hem. His feet are carved with incredible detail (down to the cuticle) and his sandals are tied neatly with thongs. His hands are empty but come together across his chest in a benedictory pose. Unlike 9th century Neo-Assyrian iconography, the man does not wear any jewelry nor a headdress, and his tunic lacks ornamentation. However, down the manâs skirt is a lengthy bilingual inscription: an Akkadian text down the front, written in a vertical orientation, and an Old Aramaic translation written horizontally on the back. The Old Aramaic inscription is one of the oldest and most complete Aramaic texts, making it an invaluable resource for understanding the vocabulary, grammar, and syntax of the Old Aramaic language. The Akkadian inscription is also interesting, as this is the only example of a vertically oriented cuneiform text in the first millennium. The dress is completely covered in text from the fringe of the belt to the fringe of the hem. The genre of the inscription is understood as a dedicatory inscription that commemorates the dedication of the statue to the Aramean god, Hadad. Hadad was at the top of the Aramean pantheon and likely had a temple or cult center at Sikan. Hadad was a storm deity worshiped among various groups in both Mesopotamia (as Adad) and Syria since the second millennium BCE. The inscription suggests that Had-Yithi dedicated this statue to evoke the protection and blessing of Hadad over his life and his reign. The inscription also includes a lengthy list of curses against any who deface the statue or remove Had-Yithiâs name from upon it. While the cultic (or religious) function of the statue is unknown, the dedication and curses suggest the statue may have been a votive statue, meant to stand in for Had-Yithi at a temple of Hadad. While much remains unknown about the actual function of the statue and its inscription, the statue itself embodies a blending of Assyrian and Aramean traditions that likely reflects the reality of 9th century Sikan.",-890,750,1926,1380,Morganne Ottobre,50,Andrew Danielson,2023-04-11 19:00:27.960 +0200,2023-04-27 18:54:27.002 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.0003792283338449663,4.2715257251190585e-09,0.6972575779834604,0.06755061950316127,1.9056626102453337e-13,2.5398649436786637e-24,0.11171920026157889,0.02021104423337861,0.10288232541285958

Methodism has unique and distinctive doctrines, rituals, customs and belief systems that are a replica to their pastoral lifestyles. Methodist Church in Zimbabwe has a membership of plus or minus 123 262 members in Zimbabwe (MCZ Handbook 2023:167-168). The development of Methodism in Zimbabwe has its roots in Britain and South Africa who initiated the missionary propagation of the word of God from the North to the South. Today we are witnessing a reverse of the spreading of the gospel where the Southern hemisphere is now going as missionaries to the North to minister in the diaspora. Currently the Zimbabwean Methodist Conference is seconding ministers to work in the diaspora. There is a total membership of 2754 members in diaspora. 339 in Australia, 75 in Botswana, 75 in Canada, 95 in Ireland, 33 in Schengen, 1163 in South Africa, 36 in United Arab Emirates, 853 in United Kingdom and 85 in United States of America (MCZ Agenda of Conference 2023:R61). Taking the example of the Methodist Church in Zimbabwe alone one can deduce that the global south has penetrated the global north. The focus of this study will be from 1891-2023, which represents the time that the first missionaries settled in Zimbabwe and were given the mandate to evangelize and established mission stations in Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe.

These districts are under the supervision of a District Bishop who has the responsibility to pastor the district and have an oversight to the whole district. The incumbents are to occupy these positions for a period of 5 years and they go back to the trenches.

Its title means the tantra of the leaping or bellowing lord.

Topics include sorcery, fantastic feats, enchanted objects, and conjuring, mostly of female creatures.  The á¹£aá¹­karmani include the following:

 1.	ÅÄnti-puá¹£á¹­i (tranquilizing-increase)

8.	mÄrana (murder)

1787,Ekphrasis of the Church of the Holy Apostles,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Ekphrasis of the Church of the Holy Apostles by Nikolaos Mesarites, a cleric who was skeuophylax of the Church of the Virgin of the Pharos and, following the fall of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade, the metropolitan of Ephesus, constitutes one of the most complete textual sources for the reconstruction of that lost edifice as well as a formidable work of rhetorical artistry in keeping with the literary and cultural sophistication of Byzantine literature during this period. It is transmitted via the codexes Ambrosianus Graecus F93 and Ambrosianus Graecus F 96 which contain the entirety of his works, and begins with a description of the situation of the church, with special attention paid to the verdancy of its encircling gardens and the natural beauty of its site, which render the Church of the Holy Apostles not only a solemn religious space but also a sensual locus amoenus. Emphasis is also placed on the educational facilities attached to the complex and on the intellectual attainments cultivated within them, a motif which also reappears at the close of the ekphrasis with a description of the contentious debates between scholars regarding philosophical and scientific matters. The majority of the piece, however, is devoted to descriptions of the building itself, most particularly the extensive pictorial cycle which graced its interior and included scenes from the New Testament and the lives of the Apostles. Mesarites focuses on the effect upon the viewer of the narrative dynamism of the images, which invite him to treat each scene as an almost cinematographic ekphrasis embedded within the greater ekphrasis of the complex. Furthermore, attention is paid to the tombs of apostles and emperors, and to the architectural ornamentation of the interior, though the actual form of the building described is difficult to discern despite critical information provided by the text. Not only does the text provide a description, albeit partial, of a vanished monument, it also provides important clues to the ways in which medieval Romans saw their world, and the multivalent identities of an ecclesiastical complex as religious site, imperial mausoleum, prestigious school, and place of sensual delectation. Moreover, the ways in which Mesarites describes the act of viewing the cycle of images inside allows us to consider the ways in which the Byzantines experienced religious art beyond the icon.",1190,1200,1897,1320,Ethan Schmidt,49,Ian Randall,2023-06-06 00:00:22.852 +0200,2023-06-10 23:11:37.734 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.001436389408412549,0.04349245456468567,2.4205253401043623e-15,0.09946488263213588,0.004850084416834748,0.6940968980955915,0.00022582137595037981,0.15643341393136986,5.557501699752987e-08

1808,'yan Taru (Women Cadre of the Nana Asma'u),43,Religious Group (v6),"'Yan Taru is a female educational empowerment movement established by Nana Asma'u (the daughter of Shaikh Uthman ibn Fodio) in 1838 to move around the caliphate on an itinerant mission to boost Islamic religious awareness among women at their matrimonial premises. The movement was a rejoinder of Ibn Fodio's effort to educate women and limit the level of illiteracy among the feminine gender that was consistently observed in educational less-advantageous personalities before the establishment of the caliphate. His educated daughter sustained the effort that remained a Teacher, educationist, and political figure in the region who published books in Hausa and Fulbe languages to draw Islamic awareness closer to those at low levels. The effort lives longer than its founder when her sister(Maryam) extended the effort longer to equip those to have taken over and establish branches of the movement wider in other regions.

1810,Shang Oracle Bone Inscriptions,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Shang oracle bone inscriptions refer to the records of pyro-osteomancy, or the burning of bones for divination purposes, conducted by the religious elites of the Shang dynasty å (1600(?)-1047 BCE). While evidence of North China Plains pyro-osteomancy is known to predate the Shang by some two millennia, the practice did not become widespread until the late 3rd and early 2nd millennium BCE, and only during the Late Shang dynasty (1200-1046 BCE) did it become an intensive, state-sponsored institution tied up with efforts to consolidate political and religious authority (Flad 2008). In a typical Late Shang divination, one face of an animal bone, usually an ox scapula or turtle plastron, was drilled with a series of hollows. When an intense heat source (a branch or rod) was applied to these hollows, the bone plate rapidly expanded and produced cracks on the reverse face. The shape, or perhaps sound, of a crack was interpreted as an auspicious or inauspicious omen in connection to a divination ""chargeâ (e.g. âIt will rain tomorrowâ). Beginning in the reign of King Wu Ding æ­¦ä¸ (ca. 1200 BCE), highly formulaic records of divinations were usually inscribed onto the bone, sometimes long after the initial bone-cracking procedure had taken place (Keightley 2000). The most detailed inscriptions comprise multiple parts: a preface including the divination date and divinerâs name, the charge, the Shang king's prognostication based on his interpretation of the cracks, and a ""verification"" ostensibly recording the actual outcome (e.g. âit really did rainâ). During the early phase of the Late Shang, divination was conducted on virtually every major issue of the day, including ritual sacrifice, military alliances, invasions, harvests, illnesses, childbirth, and dreams. Towards the end of the Shang, ritual activities were assigned to a ritual calendar, and the earlier ad hoc divinations began to vanish. Instead, divination was used almost exclusively to test the likelihood of disaster in the upcoming 10-day week. The significance of oracle bones was rediscovered at the end of the 19th century, when eminent scholar and Dean of the Hanlin Academy, Wang Yirong çæ¿æ¦® (1845-1900), noticed fragments of âdecayed tortoise shellâ proscribed to treat his guestâs malaria was inscribed with characters resembling Western Zhou (1046-771 BCE) bronze inscriptions. Shortly after, a burgeoning market for these ancient curios drove collectors and treasure-seekers to the source at Xiaotun village å°å±¯æ, in Anyang å®é½, Henan æ²³å, where at least nine private digs between 1900-1928 uncovered further fragments (Li Chi 1977: 1-14). Already in 1910, Scholarly analysis of these materials led to the conjecture that Xiaotun village occupied the site of the last Shang capital, Yinxu æ®·å¢ (lit. âthe waste of Yinâ) â a claim ultimately vindicated by official excavations led by the newly formed Institute of History and Philology between 1928-1936 (Li Chi 1977). Today, the corpus of over 150,000 inscribed oracle bones constitutes the most important source for reconstructing the social, political, economic, and religious activities of the Late Shang. At the most basic level, Shang oracle bone divinations reveal a conception of futurity which is contingent and open-ended. The future, for the Shang, represents the dominion of capricious spirits and deities whom the Shang attempted to assuage and domesticate through various forms of ritual intervention. Thus, having determined the date of an impending disaster, further divinations were typically conducted to determine the ritual actions required to secure supernatural assistance and forestall calamity. Assistance might come from one of any number of Shang deities and spirits. In general terms, the Shang pantheon consisted of an all-powerful, if distant and usually uncommunicative god, Di å¸ at the top, with a panoply of ancestral, pseudo-ancestral, local, and natural spirits below, among whom the more recently deceased seem the most communicative, and each of whom was associated with a circumscribed sphere of influence (e.g. disease, harvest, weather, warfare, etc.) (K.C.

1816,The Zhen'gao,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Zhenâgao çèª¥ [Declaration of the Perfected] is an essential work of the Shangqing (ä¸æ¸ Upper Clarity) scriptures that was compiled and collated by an elite Daoist scholar Tao Hongjing é¶å¼æ¯ (456â536 CE). The main body of the Zhenâgao is Yang Xiâs æ¥ç¾² (330â73 CE) manuscripts of the revelation instructed by a group of Perfected (zhenren çäºº), a kind of celestial beings that were conceived as situated in the higher rank than the previous known Transcendent (xianrenä»äºº) in the Shangqing scriptures. Yang Xi was a well-trained spirit medium who worked for his patrons Xu Mi è¨±è¬ (303-ca.373) and Xuâs two sons, Xu Lian è¨±è¯ (328-404) and Xu Hui è¨±ç¿½ (341-ca.370). During 365-369, Yang Xi received a great number of revelations from his Perfected in Mount Mao. The contents of the revelations are diverse that include descriptions of the celestial world and beings, answers to recipientsâ questions, instructions on Daoist practices, recipes for drugs and medicine, prophecies for the fates of people, records of dreams, and even the family matters and disputation. Yang Xiâs revelation also employs various genres of literature, such as poems, biography, conversation, and marvelous stories, to portray figures, narrate tales, and convey Daoist conceptions. Besides revelation, this work also preserves a few letters between Yang Xi and three Xu, as well as writings of other spirit mediums who preceded Yang Xi. However, these manuscripts were scattered or damaged after Xu Miâs death. The first collection of Yang Xi and three Xusâ autography manuscripts was compiled by Gu Huan é¡§æ­¡ (425â ca.479 CE) who titled this collection the Zhenji çè¿¹ [Traces of the Perfected]. The Zhenji has lost. But Tao Hongjing re-compiled, reorganized, and commented on those fragmentary manuscripts based on Gu Huanâs version after carefully identifying the authenticity of the calligraphies in the manuscripts. In order to reflect its oral tradition of instruction, Tao Hongjing named this collection the Zhenâgao [Declaration of the Perfected]. The Zhenâgao was divided into seven sections by Tao Hongjing based on the different contents. He also entitled each section with three characters by modeling the format of weft books and the Zhuangzi. The extant version preserved in the Daoist Canon is twenty juan (scroll) along with a preface by Gao Sisun é«ä¼¼å­« dated 1223. Although Yang Xi claimed through the mouth of his Perfected that the revelation written through his hand in the form of human language was from the celestial realm, these writings quoted a great number of previous Daoist works, classics, contemporary textual sources, and even Buddhist sutra. These quotations provide a rich source for us to explore the intertextuality and the reception of early texts. The Zhenâgao also preserves many historical facts, such as the interpersonal relationship of the Xu family, the connection between the gentry family and the imperial court, and the Daoist genealogy in the Six Dynasties, which offers a special window to investigate the social-historical issues.",365,2023,1999,1464,Liying Xu,45,Matthew Hamm,2023-06-30 18:58:45.405 +0200,2023-06-30 19:12:02.930 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.02917273494571862,0.004543953297022939,0.022525479763910006,2.6565920215515935e-08,0.004162122368890048,3.5504132940914944e-14,0.9395956830585025,2.2682396417859087e-25,5.88707936400616e-18

1820,"Cherubim and Seraphim Church Unification, Campus Fellowship",43,Religious Group (v6),"This is an entry about the Cherubim and Seraphim Church Unification Campus Fellowship, popularly known as
Isokan (Unification). It is a group interested in unifying the various factional bodies of the Cherubim and Seraphim (C&S) Church that got divided in 1929.

The Cherubim and Seraphim Church Unification (a.k.a. Unification), now known as the Cherubim and Seraphim Church Unification (Campus Fellowship) is a Cherubim and Seraphim church based in the institutions of higher learning in Nigeria and overseas. Its emergence was a result of the divisions that have taken place in the mother churches ever since its beginning and growth from 1925 to 1929. With the different factional bodies, what would have become of students in the higher institutions who are willing to continue to worship in the C&S setting and as members of the C&S? Thus, there was a need to have a C&S church that would serve as a church for any member of the C&S from home to join and worship his/her God. It was this that prompted some students at the University of Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University) to come together and start a C&S church devoid of factions in the C&S in March 1980. 

With penchant for worship in the C&S way and the help of some leaders of the Cherubim and Seraphim Movement Church (C&SMC), Ayo Ni O (late Special Apostle Prophet Elijah O. Akinrele, late Special Apostle Prophet (Dr) Gabriel Olubumi Fakeye, Pastor G.O. Baptist, Prophet Fasua and many more), this group of students came together at the Architecture Building (then, the Central Cafeteria) of the then University of Ife. It was this meeting that gave birth to the church, and present at the meeting were: Wale Adekoya, Michael O. Rufai, John Kayode Coker, Elijah Ajao, Kayode Sodipe, Garuba Ishola, and Olu Oduyoye with some other persons. The inauguration of the Church was done in May 1980. These students in their youthful ages came together with a vision to uniting the church which at large had been derided with many divisions. With the differences that are so obvious amidst their mother churches, their coming into school brought about a transformation into the establishment of a unified Cherubim and Seraphim. These students were not looking forward to being affiliated with any of their mother churches. They were not interested in titles, leadership tussles, polygyny, and so on. Instead of titles and leadership struggles, they employed the use of the President for their leader and brother and sister for the members of the church. One prominent thing worthy of note is that this unification group accepts only students of higher institutions as their members. The name of this group at inception was Cherubim and Seraphim Church Student Fellowship, University of Ife.",1980,2019,1082,1451,Oluwasegun Aluko,57,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,2023-07-05 13:05:08.251 +0200,2023-10-09 18:29:58.760 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.00040761062357431776,0.10223792521578688,2.286853904036602e-15,0.49973705245230277,0.0007353651688266295,0.26158548394358927,0.0001482574452254223,0.13514814216367627,1.6298701611805988e-07
1829,Cherubim and Seraphim Unification Church of Nigeria (C&SUCN),43,Religious Group (v6),"This is an entry about the Cherubim and Seraphim Unification Church of Nigeria (C&SUCN). It is a group interested in unifying the various factional bodies of the Cherubim and Seraphim (C&S) Church that got divided in 1929. From a single entity that it was during the period of 1925 and 1929, the C&S church was able to increase in leaps and bounds. However, the division that crept in between the two leaders (Moses Orimolade Tunolase and Christianah Abiodun Emanuel nee Akinsowon on ownership of the church) brought a halt to the once resplendent movement that has caught the attention of many individuals in the country. While some prominent persons who have the interest of the group at heart decided to wade into the situation and bring about a peaceful resolution, unity seems elusive. As people were interested in bringing together different factional bodies, other factions continued to spring up. 
Nevertheless, the much-anticipated unity started gathering momentum in the early 1980s with the establishment of the Unification Council of Cherubim & Seraphim (also referred to hereafter as âthe Unification Councilâ or simply as âthe Councilâ).  The Council set to work and by 1986 a leader acceptable to all the federating churches emerged in Her Most Eminence Captain (Dr.) Christiana Abiodun Emanuel, who was installed as the Supreme Head (Olori). This Unification Council took off with five mother churches that include: the Eternal Sacred Order of Cherubim & Seraphim, The Praying Band of the Sacred Society of Cherubim & Seraphim, Cherubim & Seraphim Society, The Sacred Cherubim & Seraphim Society, and the Holy Order of Cherubim & Seraphim Church Movement, now known as Cherubim and Seraphim Movement Church. Over the years, the Unification Council metamorphosed into âthe Cherubim & Seraphim Unification Church of Nigeriaâ (also referred to later as âthe Unification Churchâ or simply as âthe Churchâ) which was registered by the Corporate Affairs Commission of the country on 9th September 1999 and has continued to build on the foundation laid by the Council.
It must be noted that despite the founding of this Unification Church, many factional bodies are yet to join in this unification drive. Nevertheless, since the establishment of this unification group, the Cherubim and Seraphim Church as a whole now have a single mouthpiece that can voice the concern of the church at the centre.

1835,"The Cherubim and Seraphim Church of Zion, Ugbonla",43,Religious Group (v6),"The Cherubim and Seraphim Church of Zion was founded on 16th February 1948 in Ugbonla, Ilaje area on the eastern flank of Yorubaland in southwest Nigeria. It is an offshoot of the Cherubim and Seraphim (C & S) Society, a Christian movement which started as a praying group comprising crowds (people) who thronged the home where Abiodun Akinsowon was resident after she had a mysterious encounter. Abiodun had peeped into the chalice of a religious procession and had gone into a trance for days until Moses Tunolase Orimolade was contacted to help restore her to life. This occurred in 1925 in Lagos, Nigeria. As the society began to meet to pray and fellowship, two brothers of Ilaje origin who had visited Lagos and joined the C & S Society and had become very active members of the group. 


The two brothers (Alfred and Timothy Orogbemi) returned to Ilajeland in 1929 and introduced the C & S Society to their homeland. The society grew steadily till it began experiencing some internal crisis at about 1942. Some of her members had accused the church of its acquiescence with the local authority regarding the practice of twin infanticide sanctioned by the latter at the time. The aggrieved members began to pull out of the society as early as 1945 and had predicted that the church will lose its relevance in Ilajeland if it fails to rise to condemn the practice they considered unacceptable. It is widely believed among the antagonists of the practice that had the founder of the C & S Zion Church failed to pull out of the larger society in their homeland and established a reformed version of the church, the C & S Society in Ilajeland, the church would have lost currency with the people.


While the Holy Apostles community, Ayetoro (the first successful theocratic community in Ilajeland) took on a unique description of the interconnectivity between faith and woks and thus had a successful economic and technological campaign, the C & S church of Zion, Ugbonla founded one year after Ayetoro had a spiritual expansionist outlook. The latter expanded its influence and dominance in the area by successfully galvanising the almost fifty other smaller theocratic settlements which sprang up after it. Saint Elisha Lene Ogunfeyimi, the founder of Ugbonla community laid the foundation for several of the doctrinal guidelines which most of the other theocratic communities in Ilajeland subsequently adopted. Ugbonla boasts of hundreds of branches across three continents of the world.

1845,Benedictine Order in Denmark,43,Religious Group (v6),"As far as all the different monastic orders who were present in medieval Denmark are concerned, the Benedictine Order is particularly interesting as it seems to have been the very first monastic order to arrive in Denmark. The exact circumstances regarding when, where and how the order first arrived in Denmark fade into history, but it must have happened during the 11th C. The Benedictine monastery for monks in Odense, also serving as the holy chapter of Odense diocese, is known to have been founded by king Erik I Evergood of Denmark (1095-1103) no later than c. the second half of the 1090Â´s. The only other monastic order potentially present in Denmark around that time, this early on, was the Augustinians. This order arrived no later than during the early 12th C. According to the tradition of Danish medieval annals from the c. 12/13th C., however, it was the christian viking king Cnut the Great (1018-1035) who was the first to bring monks to Denmark. At his time, Danish vikings had conquered England and Cnut thus served not only as king of Denmark, but also as king of England amongst other areas. Obviously, these annals were written only a very long time after events and any actual proof of this is therefore lacking, but there may be arguments in favor of believing in it. Firstly, it would seem to fit in rather well with knowledge of both CnutÂ´s reign and of his acts as king of England. Secondly, the Benedictine monastery in Odense does not seem to be the first monastery in Denmark, thus the introduction of monks into Denmark must have happened already before the reign of Erik Evergood. Considering the 11th c. Danish kings before Erik, Cnut seems to be a likely candidate. One thing is that Cnut is believed to have been in active in organizing the early Danish diocesial structure and introducing also the concept of monasteries would thus have been a strong act logically attached to this work. Another thing is that his main successor as long-reigning king of Denmark during the 11th C., king Svend II EstridsÃ¸n (1047-1074/76), is known to have to been working intensely on not only reorganizing the Danish diocesial structure, but also on liberating the Danish church from the authority of the archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen by getting papal permission to create an independent Danish archbishopric. This scheme did not succeed during his reign already, but question is whether his attempted plan would have been realistic and feasible at all if not even just a single monastery still existed in Denmark to support the diocesial structure and the available religious expertise present within the Danish church. Monasteries formed a very important part of the medieval church and imagining an independent Danish archbishopric without even just a single existing monastery would hardly be a realistic perspective in 11th C. Europe. This is something that Svend EstridsÃ¸n, as king and politician, would most likely have known also. Thus it should probably be believed that the first monasteries and monks, as a concept, were introduced into Denmark no later than during the reign of Svend EstridsÃ¸n and it is not unlikely that it could have happened already before that. As for Danish kings before Svend EstridsÃ¸n who could have done that, potentially, none other than Cnut the Great seems to be an obvious candidate for such an act. Talking about monasteries and monks in Denmark as early as the time of Cnut the Great and Svend EstridsÃ¸n, this would most likely have been Benedictine monks. This early on in Denmark, however, talking about any strong and firmly established monastic structure represented in any large numbers is absolutely unrealistic. Whether it was introduced by Cnut the Great or by Svend EstridsÃ¸n later on, at that time we are talking about only a single or a few monasteries at some very well-considered locations. Due to lack of sources on the early Danish monastic structure, it remains unknown which exact Benedictine monastery or monasteries that would have been the oldest one(s) in Denmark, but a few candidates can likely be nominated and the oldest Benedictine monastery in Denmark should probably be found amongst these candidates. Discussing the earliest Danish Augustinian convents thus must be a story for another time and this entry will therefore focus on the Benedictines exclusively.  As the abovementioned Danish annals also indicate, the Benedictine monasteries for nuns should probably be ruled out when considering which Danish monastery that possibly was the very first one in the country. Nunneries were generally introduced a little later than friaries in all the other monastic orders who were present in medieval Denmark, and there is no reason to believe that it would have been any different as regards the Benedictines. Also some of the benedictine monasteries for monks should probably be ruled out from such a discussion, as they seem to have been founded only later on. As far as candidates for identifying the very first Danish monastery are concerned, we are thus talking about identifying Danish Benedictine monasteries where signs can be found to make it seem likely that the monastery might perhaps have it roots of foundation during the 11th C. In addition to Odense there are only a few Danish Benedictine monasteries which seem even just potentially that old. Candidate no. 1 is Veng monastery in Jutland. Written sources on its early history say that it was founded and enriched by unspecified Danish kings well before the 1160Â´s, but sources are otherwise absent. However, the monastery church is still preserved and this building is clearly both old and early. The most recent investigation suggests that it may have been built as early as the 1080Â´s or perhaps later than that. However, this does not necessarily mean that the monastery was also founded only then. It seems to have been quite common that Danish monasteries used temporary wooden churches sometimes even for decades until the building of a stone church could be financed. So Veng monastery as an institution may actually have been older than the church building, although the exact age of Veng monastery remains hazy. Part of the explanation for this may be that it was closed already during the 12th C. and incorporated into the Cistercian monastery of Ãm. Glenstrup monastery, also in Jutland, should probably be mentioned as candidate no. 2. The preserved monastery church seems likely to suggest that it may have been a quite early institution, although how early exactly is unknown as the early history also of this Benedictine monastery remains hazy due to lack of sources. It was later closed during the 15th C. and incorporated into the monastery of the bridgettines in Mariager. Candidate no. 3 must be the monastery of the benedictine monks in Lund in Scania which seems to have roots in the 11th C. as it was most likely founded between c. 1072/75 and 1089. The town of Lund became the site of the Danish archbishopric from the early 12th C. onwards, and the town thus seems to have become increasingly important already during the second half of the 11th C. which is why such an early monastery right here makes great sense. Candidates no. 4 and 5 are the two monasteries in Ringsted and Slagelse, respectively, both placed on Zealand. Both monasteries were apparently founded sometime between 1074 and 1088. The benedictine monastery in Ringsted evolved to become one of the most important monasteries of medieval Denmark. The monastery in Slagelse, however, is unknown to such an extent that is has been doubted whether it actually ever existed at all. There are, however, rather clear signs that it probably did. Its founding is spoken of directly by the Roskilde Chronicle and this piece of information in here is likely to have been based on the early archives of Roskilde diocese. A preserved medieval manuscript from around 1200, or perhaps from c. the first quarter of the 13th C., containing text by Pliny the Elder, also states that the manuscript was written by an otherwise unknown Danish man called Peter of Slagelse - most likely a monk. At that point in time in Denmark writing expertise at such a level would generally have been attached either to the dioceses and their holy chapters, to the royal court or to the monastic world. The manuscript therefore speaks in favor of the institution in Slagelse probably being an early benedictine monastery which was most likely closed no later than c. mid-13th C. Candidates no. 6, 7, and 8 must be the benedictine monasteries at either Slesvig, Seem, or perhaps Randers -all placed in Jutland. These monasteries become candidates as they all seem likely to have originated as double monasteries for both monks and nuns. This type of benedictine double monasteries, however, generally became obsolete after roughly 1100 or the early 1100s after which new ones were not really founded anymore and the existing ones were gradually dissolved - usually by either the monks or the nuns moving away to another newly established monastery instead. By originating as double monasteries these three institutions all suggest themselves as potentially quite early foundations, even despite the scarcity of sources. In Randers the monastery of the benedictine nuns perhaps originated as a double monastery until the monks moved away to EssenbÃ¦k monastery in the 12th C. Benedictine double monasteries are known with a far higher degree of certainty, though, from Slesvig and Seem. The monastery in Slesvig seems most likely to be the best candidate as for naming the oldest monastery in Denmark. It seems to have originated sometime during the 11th C. If it was founded either during the reign of Cnut the Great or perhaps a bit later on around 1050, during the early days of Svend EstridsÃ¸n, it would have been situated very near to Hedeby. This location would make great sense as for the placing of such a very early monastery since Hedeby was one the most important towns of viking age Denmark and it thus also was an essential location for the Danish kings of that era. Despite the lack of written sources to support it, Cnut the Great having founded a benedictine monastery here could therefore easily be imagined. Another thing potentially speaking in favor of regarding the benedictines of Slesvig as inhabitants of the oldest monastery in Denmark is the fact that the 13th C. annals from Ryd monastery is the main source mentioning Cnut the Great as the very first to bring monks into Denmark. These annals were based on older source material and when the monastery of the benedictine monks in Slesvig was closed during the late 12th C., it ended up being incorporated into a Cistercian institution which soon evolved to become Ryd monastery. Ryd monastery thus was the successor institution of the benedictine friary in Slesvig and memorial traditions stemming from the predecessor institution could thus very well have seeped onwards through time into the successor institution until finally ending up in their written annals. If this assumption is correct it would speak in favor of the benedictine friary in Slesvig having been founded likely during the reign of Cnut the Great as, in all probability, the oldest monastery in Denmark. The benedictine order remained in Denmark until their monasteries were gradually closed after the Reformation. Their glory days, however, were pretty much over from c. the second half the 12th C. onwards after which other monastic orders took over and carried the banner of monastic fashion instead. From then on, a great number of Danish benedictine monasteries were either incorporated into monasteries of other orders or closed entirely and very few new ones were founded.",1018,1536,2010,1345,Svend Clausen,49,Ian Randall,2023-07-10 16:16:16.425 +0200,2023-08-02 11:49:22.641 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.0001018561239949553,0.0031589904573028275,0.002964636793010279,0.05983943761464503,0.006453334779161219,4.1552670541240375e-23,4.157543948962173e-05,1.8889146890317205e-11,0.9274401687735069
1855,Atra-HasÄ«s,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Epic of Atra-HasÄ«s is an Old Babylonian poem that narrates the story of the man who survived the Flood. The best-preserved edition of the text known by the ancient Mesopotamians as enÅ«ma ilÅ« awÄlum (âWhen the Gods Were Manâ) is dated to the reign of Ammi-á¹¢aduqa of Babylon (c. 1702-1682 BCE), as evidenced by the colophon, which also preserves the name of the scribe responsible for the edition, Kasaq-Aya (or NÅ«r-Aya). 
Divided into three tablets, each with eight columns of about fifty-five lines, the composition recounts two different stories, the first of which refers to the deities and the creation of humanity to free them from the burden of work, the second to the near-destruction of the human race by the Flood. Despite divineâs intentions, the creation of the human being led to its uncontrolled reproduction and the consequent noise that disturbed the celestial sphere. The head of the pantheon, god Enlil, thus decided to convene a âwar councilâ and after sending several afflictions to decrease the number of humans, he finally decided to send the Flood to wipe out humanity. Nevertheless, using his powers, god Enki instructed an âextraordinary wiseâ man (meaning of the name Atra-HasÄ«s in Akkadian) to build a vessel and save humankind from destruction. As a consequence of his actions, Atra-HasÄ«s was granted immortality, and the deities took a series of measures in order to prevent overpopulation.
Besides the Old Babylonian tablets from Sippar, other Middle and Late Babylonian fragments of the composition were exhumed at Babylon, Nippur, Ugarit, and Sippar. Plus, a Late Assyrian edition was recovered from Ashurbanipalâs (c. 668-627 BCE) library in Nineveh. 
Furthermore, although Atra-HasÄ«s is the best-known poetic text related to the Flood, additional testimonies of the same story have been found in ancient Mesopotamia. In Sumerian written evidence from roughly the same period as the earlier copies of Atra-HasÄ«s, the Deluge hero bears the name Ziusudra (i.e. the one who lived a âlife of long daysâ). Accordingly, in the Flood story preserved on tablet XI of the Epic of Gilgamesh, the survivor of the Flood is known as Uta-napiÅ¡tim, meaning âthe one who found lifeâ.",-1700,-600,1631,1470,Maria de FÃ¡tima Rosa,50,Andrew Danielson,2023-07-13 17:27:27.453 +0200,2024-06-05 22:08:00.467 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),1.990856183201007e-23,3.5827173239004003e-31,2.9807105342614753e-12,2.662678053607665e-13,2.5528603763405336e-24,9.366875344017387e-25,0.999999999996753,1.1314290182102603e-30,3.922135327282233e-20
1858,Christianity in Alexandria: From Origen to Athanasius,43,Religious Group (v6),"The tradition of the Orthodox Church attributes the foundation of the Church of Alexandria to Mark, the author of the Gospel. Christianity, however, probably entered Alexandria through its large Jewish community. Clear evidence of an organized Alexandrian church appears around 180 CE, although its origins must be much earlier, with a bishop and twelve presbyters. Public preaching was hardly possible where Christianity was not a legal religion, and a key to Christian expansion lay in its teachers, resembling those of a philosophical school. The Catechetical school of Alexandria not only prepared enquirers for baptism, but also presented Christianity in terms of the Greek intellectual tradition. Successive leaders of the school were Pantaenus, a converted Stoic philosopher, Clement, also a converted philosopher, of Athenian origin, and Origen, born of Christian parents around 185, who studied under Ammonius Saccas. 
In Alexandria, during the period under investigation, Christianity became quite different in the Catechetical School of the city. Clement saw philosophy as part of a divine educational process to prepare humanity for Christianity and the Christian life as a school of perfection. He accepted the Apostolic traditions, but he wished to show that they possessed a far deeper meaning than they could possibly have possessed among the immediate followers of Christ. Clement was convinced that this new religion, Christianity, if properly understood, was worthy of being accepted by the most enlightened minds. He claimed the most perfect freedom of interpretation and speculation. By applying the same allegorical interpretation which Philo had used in interpreting the Old Testament, to the New, Clement convinced himself and managed to convince others that there was no opposition between philosophy and religion. What Clement had most at heart was not the letter but the spirit, not the historical events, but their deeper meaning in universal history. Origen was the most prodigious scholar of early Christianity. He introduced new forms of learned activity such as textual criticism and systematic theology, extending others such as the biblical commentary, and engaging with the whole range of Greek thought and science. Like Clement he drew on the Platonism already used by the Alexandrian Jewish scholar Philo to present biblical teaching, and, like Philo, used allegorical exegesis of the Old Testament, maintaining the link between Christianity and Israel.
Up to 313, Alexandrian Christianity suffered periodic violence, sometimes severe, from the Roman state. However, with the toleration of Christianity in 313, the first major theological controversy arose. The Alexandrian presbyter Arius posited a theory of the divine âsonshipâ which could be interpreted as making Jesus Christ a sort of demigod. Denounced by his bishop, Alexander, Arius found support elsewhere in the Greek world. The creed of the Council of Nicaea (325 CE) established the position generally regarded as orthodox, which was elaborated by the Alexandrian theologian and future bishop Athanasius (295-373). Both sides could claim to be drawing on Origenâs legacy. Alexandrian theology continued to focus on the full divinity of Christ, and on the union of the divine and human in Christ, an emphasis later visible when a majority in the Egyptian church adopted a Monophysite form of theology.",185,373,2015,1170,Lampros Alexopoulos,49,Ian Randall,2023-07-15 17:25:54.881 +0200,2023-07-29 10:07:58.537 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),1.0564088749674917e-07,0.0013048647570247085,0.001566359418684394,0.032297272072232736,0.0010916765972647513,1.0113661934656867e-24,2.2228163367130924e-07,1.4346938158366733e-12,0.9637394992308375
1869,IFA RELIGIOUS GROUP IN ILE- IFE,43,Religious Group (v6),"Ife is indeed a place of great cultural and religious significance among the Yoruba people in Nigeria. It holds a unique position in Yoruba history and traditions. Ife has a relatively small population of approximately 49,000 people. The Ooni of Ife, often regarded as the spiritual leader of all Yoruba people, is a figure of immense importance. The Ooni wields significant influence over both the historical and contemporary affairs of the Yoruba people. This leadership role is not just symbolic but carries practical importance in various aspects of Yoruba culture and traditions. Ife is deeply rooted in Yoruba religious traditions. The Yoruba people practice a form of traditional religion that involves the worship of various deities (orisha) and ancestral spirits. These deities play a vital role in Yoruba religious practices. Some of the prominent deities with strong connections to Ife include Oduduwa, Obatala, Yemonja, Aje, Ogun, and Ifa. Orunmila, the head of the Ifa cult, is particularly revered for his special gift of spiritual wisdom and knowledge, as well as for initiating Ifa divination, which is a central aspect of  Ife religious practices. Agriculture, particularly farming, is a crucial economic activity in Ife. The  Ife people  rely on farming for sustenance, trade, and medicinal purposes. Agriculture not only provides food but also serves as a source of traditional medicine, underlining its importance in the community's survival and well-being. The history of Ife is primarily passed down through oral traditions. While it may not be documented in written texts like religious scriptures, these oral histories are valuable sources of information about the city's cultural and historical significance. Oral traditions are a common way of preserving history and cultural knowledge among many African societies. The two notable kings in the history of Ife are Adesoji Aderemi and Okunade Sijuwade. They made significant contributions to the development of Ife.  Adesoji Aderemi, as the first indigenous governor of Western Nigeria, focused on promoting indigenous religion and cultural practices. Okunade Sijuwade continued to support social and religious activities in Ife, gaining international attention and recognition. Ife's rich cultural heritage, religious traditions, and historical importance make it a unique and vital city within Nigeria and the broader Yoruba culture. The Ifa group and the worship of Yoruba deities are integral components of the city's cultural and religious tapestry, reflecting the deep-rooted traditions and spirituality of the  Ife people. This entry will therefore look at the religious tradition of the Ifa group of ife  people.",1930,2015,2017,1460,olusegun oladosu,57,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,2023-07-18 15:52:40.382 +0200,2023-10-29 18:28:11.309 +0100,Personal Expertise,0.9994743181944807,5.081740849608235e-13,1.3970452719748486e-16,7.99907136451167e-05,4.2305655236906895e-16,0.00044569106436250584,1.8202055612086845e-13,2.6820818930269555e-11,2.1777081727380084e-32
1871,Inana's descent to the nether world,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"""Inana's descent to the nether worldâ is a Sumerian literary composition focused on describing this goddess' plan to conquer the realm of the dead, ruled by her divine sister, EreÅ¡kigal, as well as the results of such attack.
To reconstruct these 412 lines of composition, modern scholars have used more than fifty cuneiform fragments and tablets, from different space-temporal contexts. Though most of the surviving copies, identified at Ur and Nippur, are dated to the first half of the 2nd millennium BCE, the origins of this story appear rooted in the preceding millennium. 
The composition can be divided into five main sections: a) Inanaâs decision and preparations for the journey and the consequent arrival at the first gate of  the Netherworld (lines 1-73); b) the goddess' interaction with Neti, the guardian of the Netherworld, and her subsequent passage through its seven gates (lines 74-163); c) the confrontation between Inana and EreÅ¡kigal and her captivity (lines 164-172); d) the process for rescuing Inana and the attempts to find her a substitute (lines 173-367); e) the imprisonment of Dumuzi, Inanaâs traditional divine lover, and the ultimate decision of having his sister, GeÅ¡tinanna, taking turns with him in the Netherworld as Inanaâs substitutes. Sladek (1974:51) identified how this last section integrated an original independent story, focused on Dumuziâs death and known traditionally as âDumuziâs Dreamâ, which appears in circa seventy tablets.
This composition has a profound literary richness, dealing with several different themes, such as the limits and rules of cosmic domains; limits to divine powers; conceptions on death and funerary practices; and of course, the nature and roles of goddess Inana.
Despite the deep parallelisms with the storyline of the Akkadian composition known as âIÅ¡tar's Descent to the Netherworldâ, a closer look allows to observe a certain autonomy between both texts, which is visible in the goals, tone, and literary mechanisms of each one. For instance, it should be stressed how the Sumerian composition is more focused on Inana's actions and individual consequences, while the Akkadian text boosts this ""personal"" dimension into a cosmic one. In fact, by describing how IÅ¡tar's imprisonment impacted the fertility on both heavenly and earthly domains, the tone of the Akkadian text is much more intense (Katz 2003:256-258; Almeida 2015: 268-270). Accordingly, each introductory section expresses a thematic shift, which is deepened as the events are unfolded in the following segments.",-1900,-1600,476,1468,Isabel Gomes de Almeida,50,Andrew Danielson,2023-07-21 12:29:55.536 +0200,2024-03-28 19:23:22.257 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),3.883555599516016e-12,1.1602931084939333e-19,1.5883448713962607e-11,0.39049724254804685,2.19906445394423e-23,1.4047576965277738e-22,0.6095027574319046,2.8143621431435877e-13,1.1505225346960882e-18
1872,"The Holy Apostles Community, Ayetoro",43,Religious Group (v6),"The Holy Apostles Community, Ayetoro was founded in January 1947. The community came into existence after an irreconcilable difference broke between the Holy Apostles and the traditional institution in Ilajeland. The former had strongly opposed and publicly condemned the traditional practice of twin infanticide sanctioned by the latter in their homeland at the time. Prior to these confrontations, members of the Ayetoro community had identified as followers of the Cherubim and Seraphim Society which was introduced to Ilajeland in 1929. They had accused the leadership of the Cherubim and Seraphim in Ilajeland of acquiescence with the traditional practice and warned that the society would lose its relevance if it failed to speak up against the practice. Several acts of civil disobedience were reported against the prophets and members of the group which would later adopt the name: Holy Apostles.
 

Some of them were fined by the local authority while others served jail terms over charges preferred against them by the traditional institution which they contended with. But these punitive measures were not able to break their ranks until they organised themselves and began to migrate to uninhabited islands and swamps which belonged to families of notable personalities among them. Their first attempt at establishing a theocratic community was made in 1945. The primary aim of the group was to organise themselves and establish a new community which would be free from the influence and control of the local authority in their homeland. This attempt failed owing to the report made against the Holy Apostles by the traditional institution they opposed. Upon the receipt of the report, the District Officer at the Okitipupa Divisional Office of the Colonial Administration came down to the newly founded community to investigate the report. A member of the community attempted to harm the District Officer who brought the full weight of the law on the leaders of the newly founded community. When he and others arrested with him were released from custody, he refused to return to the community. This left a leadership gap which had to be filled. There were fears of attacks and mass arrests from the authorities. This informed the new leaderâs consultations with the members on the need to relocate to a new site. They therefore migrated to Ayetoro in January 1947. 


In 1948, the Oba (monarch) of Ayetoro introduced communalism to the community. All members relinquished ownership of their personal belongings to the community and a new wave of development was witnessed. Within a decade, Ayetoro had become the first community to have public electricity in the Old Ondo Area. Besides, the community had built a functional technical workshop and college which trained marine engineers and other categories of technicians. They built a primary school and the first secondary school in Ilajeland. They invested heavily in transportation business by building boats which aided the movement of persons, goods and services along the waterways between Lagos in the west and Cameroon in the east. The community built fishing trawlers which launched into the ocean, harvesting varieties of fish which the community sold in markets locally and in Lagos. They built modern houses and constructed solid walkways on stilts. This development aided movement across the entire community and supported the Obaâs car to tour the community. It was a novel invention in Ilajeland. The communityâs economic and technological advancement was rapid and well sustained that it soon began to attract the attention of the government and global development bodies. By 1970, Ayetoro abolished communalism and it soon began to witness decay to its economic assets. Today, the only visible traces of the once prosperous community are the relics of the assets it once deployed for economic and technological development. Over the years, Ayetoro has gone through some stages in her spiritual journey. In the past, especially at some point during the period of its massive economic and technological drive it played down on religion. It has again witnessed a revival of its spiritual fervour. The continuous existence of the community is threatened owing to the massive ocean surge which has permanently swept more than half of its original landmass under the Atlantic Ocean.",1947,2023,2063,1445,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,55,Julian Weideman,2023-07-22 18:30:39.906 +0200,2023-09-14 11:18:38.039 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.0869194982287621,0.14223803861026935,3.624680708495366e-15,0.03245991528669422,0.0017059579121572557,0.6975609575125579,4.777784170396795e-15,0.039115632449550616,1.0481803459024434e-18

1882,The Life of Severus,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The âLife of Severusâ written by Zacharias Scholasticus (or rhetor, or Zacharias bishop of Mytilene) is a work of significant importance for understanding the cultural and spiritual influences, the history of the Monophysite movement during the fifth and sixth centuries, but also of the student environment of Alexandria and Beirut towards the end of the fifth century. Severus is considered as one of the most important Greek theologians of the sixth century and as the main authority on Christology for the Syrian Orthodox tradition. He was born in Sozopolis, in Pisidia, around 459, probably from a pagan family. He begun his studies in Alexandria and then he went to study law at the Law school of Beirut, where he was converted to Christianity, perhaps under the influence of his biographer. He was baptised in 488 at the shrine of Saint Leontius in Tripoli. He became a monk and resided in a monastery near Gaza -a stronghold of Monophysites. When Flavian II was deposed from the patriarchal see of Antioch in 512, Severus was elected as his successor. However, with the death of the emperor Anastasius in 518 and because of the pro-Chalcedonian ecclesiastical policy that Anastasiusâs successor, Justin I, adopted, Severus was forced to leave Antioch. He went to Egypt where he spent the rest of his life until his death, in February of 538. In 536 Justin I had his writings, originally written in Greek, condemned. Therefore, most of them survive only in Syriac translations (theological treatises refuting either Chalcedonian polemic or the more extreme anti-Chalcedonians, an extensive polemical work against Julian of Halicarnassus, as well as a small proportion of his vast correspondence). The hundred-page biography of the Monophysite Patriarch of Antioch was prepared sometime after Severusâs accession to the patriarchal throne of Antioch in November 512. It focuses on Severusâs career up to his enthronement, without dealing with the events after his accession. Zachariasâs intention is to defend his close friend and fellow student against rumors that claimed that Severus was a devout pagan during his student years in Alexandria, while he participated and offered sacrifices while studying in Beirut. The âLifeâ consists of four sections: it begins with a short dialogue between Zacharias and an anonymous person, where the author of the text becomes aware of the slanders against Severus. Next, Zacharias focuses on the early years of Severusâs life, his family background and his rhetorical training in Alexandria, describing the experiences of Severus as a member of a group of Alexandrian âphiloponoiâ, that is, Christian zealots students like Zacharias, who had close ties to the monophysite monastic community of âEnatonâ, near Alexandria. Apart from the facts, however, that describe Severusâs life, what is also quite significant with the text is the fact that it provides us with first-hand information about the student life in Alexandria and Beirut and the conflicts between pagans and Christians and the anti-pagan policy of Emperor Zeno. Zacharias interposes the case of Paralius, a pagan student who was converted to Christianity. Bacause Paralius accused his teacher, Horapollo the Younger, and his circle of sorcery and witchcraft, he was beaten up by his fellow students. Because of that, a series of anti-pagan riots broke out in Alexandria, guided by the Patriarch Peter III Mongus, which led to the looting of the sanctuary of Isis in Menouthis and the burning of pagan cult objects. Shortly after, Emperor Zeno sent delegates to Alexandria to investigate whether the pagan teachers practiced pagan rituals. The result was the ill-treatment and expulsion of prominent pagan (mostly neoplatonic) teachers. After Paraliusâs incident, Zacharias takes his readers to Beirut, where he describes Severusâs legal studies. There, Severus participates in a group of zealot Christian students in close contact with monophysite monastic centers in Palestine. Severus provides religious instruction to his fellow students, while he fights paganism in the student community of the city, organizing raids. The final section of the text emphasizes on Severusâs decision to abandon his legal career and retire to a monastery near the town of Maiuma in Gaza.",512,518,2048,1170,Lampros Alexopoulos,49,Ian Randall,2023-07-29 15:40:43.481 +0200,2023-09-01 20:52:23.120 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),6.623429128791312e-08,0.0008181187649595704,0.00717566028727079,0.020249611461326526,0.001415713004550904,6.341022367762769e-25,1.4753165536678225e-07,8.995184569083395e-13,0.970340682715046
1897,"The Episcopal Church of Cherubim and Seraphim, Zion Pepe",43,Religious Group (v6),"The Episcopal Church of Cherubim and Seraphim, Zion Pepe was established on January 2, 1951 by a group predominantly made up of Ilaje men and women who lived or hailed from the Etikan and Aheri axis of Ilajeland. They had previously subscribed to the Cherubim and Seraphim Society which made its way into Ilajeland in 1929 and had continued to pursue their spiritual enlightenment with the Cherubim and Seraphim Church, Ugbonla from February 16, 1948 when that movement became distinct from the erstwhile Cherubim and Seraphim movement in Ilajeland. Worshippers at Ugbonla who travelled from Aheri and Etikan area of Ilajeland often had tortuous journeys to the community, They had to travel in dugout canoes for hours and at times in the rain. Apostle Theophilus Erejuwa Mafo, an associate of Saint Elisha Lene Ogunfeyimi then took it upon himself to establish another Zion community in the fringes of Etikan and Aheri. He moved to an uninhabited land (Zion Pepe) off his natal settlement of Ipepe to begin a new Zion which began to serve the spiritual enlightenment desire of C & S members in that area of Ilajeland. 


The church founded by Saint Mafo took up a hybrid name collapsing the nomenclature of the Episcopal church in his natal settlement with the C & S movement he was introducing there. Thus he tagged the church the Episcopal Church of Cherubim and Seraphim, Zion Pepe. The structure, operational guidelines, doctrines, beliefs and practices of the church are like those held by the C & S Zion, Ugbonla. However, the clerical order and titles of religious specialists in the community differ from those used in Ugbonla. As a theocratic settlement, the community holds religious meetings twice daily in the only religious house built and permitted within its borders. The religious specialists in the community daily bring the congregation inspiring sermons, songs in the spiritually charged atmosphere. The communityâs annual conventions and anniversaries are moments of spiritual rejuvenation and revival. 


Compared to other theocratic communities in Ilajeland, Zion Pepe seems to have enjoyed more stable succession processes to the throne. Of the six Obas (monarchs) who have reigned in the community, only once was there some dispute in the process leading to the selection of the successor. The community also appears to be liberal when scouting for the a new Oba. They have brought prophets who were domiciled in branches of the church to lead the community while passing over some other powerful and eligible prophets in the headquarters. Zion Pepe continues to enjoy a stable spiritual atmosphere as it has also made considerable gains in their social and economic aspirations.",1951,2023,2040,1445,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,55,Julian Weideman,2023-08-02 16:11:58.067 +0200,2023-09-14 11:21:43.768 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.030114620875217112,0.40822608598647997,4.181050685658445e-15,0.19911594879335678,0.00031579769744512654,0.3209686317040127,3.829701096039425e-15,0.04125891494348033,3.75315331857006e-18

1908,"Buddhist Traders in the Chinese Quarter in Hakata, Japan",43,Religious Group (v6),"The ""Chinese Quarter"" in Hakata, Japan, was a residential area that existed around 1100 - 1300 near Hakata Bay. The Chinese Quarter was home to hundreds of households, most of whom were Chinese merchants. Those merchants, although they took permanent residence in Hakata, traveled between China and Japan frequently. The majority of the merchants were probably from the southeast coast of China, where many prestigious Buddhist monasteries were located. Due to certain regulations issued by the Japanese government, Chinese merchants were not allowed to take long residence in Japan until the twelfth century, when Dazaifu, the Kyushu Headquarters, loosened its control of foreign visitors. The retreat of Dazaifu became an opportunity for the Chinese merchants to lay down roots in Japan. 
Many of the merchants were devoted Buddhist laymen. They frequently visited monasteries in both China and Japan and thus became crucial links between the continent and the archipelago. They donated to Buddhist monasteries in both China and Japan. The Tianyi Pavilion in Ningbo, China, has preserved three bricks that recorded the merchants from the ""Chinese Quarter"" (Tang fang åæ¿) in Hakata made donations to pave a pilgrim road in Ningbo. The merchants also formed a close relationship with monks by providing transportation for the monks to cross the sea and serving as their messengers. Certain merchants even earned a position in Buddhist records. The Buddhist traders in the Chinese Quarter played an important role in spreading Zen Buddhism from China to Japan. 
Some wealthy merchants even helped to build the earliest Zen monasteries in Japan, right in the Chinese Quarter. Xie Guoming è¬åæ is a representative figure. He was originally from Hangzhou, China, and lived in the Chinese Quarter and married a Japanese woman. He built a Zen monastery, JÅtenji, in the Chinese Quarter and invited a famous monk, Enni Ben'en, to be the founding abbot. Enni had studied at the prestigious Jingshan monastery in Hangzhou, and the collaboration among Buddhist traders and Buddhist masters further consolidated the Buddhist and commercial connections between Kyushu and southeast China.
The Buddhist traders in the Chinese Quarter also adopted religious practices unique to Japan. For example, archaeological evidence shows that Chinese merchants built sutra mounds in the Hakata area, a practice to prepare for the coming of the Final Dharma, which was popular only in Japan.",1100,1300,2035,1479,Yiwen Li,45,Matthew Hamm,2023-08-09 08:47:21.919 +0200,2023-08-25 06:52:24.491 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.5620346857931313,0.041462933358980554,0.13448501025345536,0.15030625491262167,0.11171111567710536,2.5871339856802446e-12,1.949463310765794e-12,1.6926689283663101e-13,2.6630917639235838e-17
1921,Zhouxun å¨è¨,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Zhouxun or Instructions of the Zhou is a late Warring States text, which, alongside several other manuscripts, was donated to Peking University in 2009 and published in the third volume of the Peking University collection in 2015. The provenance of the collection and the circumstances of its discovery remain unknown. Hence, the texts comprised in it are often categorized as âlootedâ. The obtained copy of the Zhouxun was, most likely, produced in the early first century BCE, so, unlike some other âlootedâ manuscripts, it is not a contemporary forgery. The Beida Zhouxun has no counterpart in the received literature. But there is a mention of an eponymous text in 14 chapters in the Daoist section of the Hanshu bibliography. Intriguingly, the recovered manuscript contains exactly the same number of chapters. It is plausible to assume that the Beida manuscript and the Zhouxun listed in the Hanshu represent versions of the same text. Firstly, it is unlikely that two different texts with the same title and scope existed during roughly the same period of time, and, secondly, some ideas promoted in the Beida Zhouxun can, indeed, be associated with Daoist lore (even though its overall philosophical outlook is rather âeclecticâ). The extant version is structured around the alleged encounters between Lord Zhaowen of Zhou å¨æ­æå¬ and Prince Gong å±å¤§å­. The characters refer to two members of Zhou aristocracy, who, mentioned in several pre-imperial and early Han works, lived in the second half of the 4th century BCE. However, the Zhouxun is unique in depicting them together, namely, as a father and his heir. According to the text, Prince Gong attended the court of his father, situated in the capital of the East Zhou, Chengzhou æå¨, on the first day of each month (including the intercalary month) as well as on the day after the La-Festival of an unspecified year. Over the course of these fourteen audiences, the ruler is shown to personally admonish the prince to become âworthyâ (xian è³¢) lest he be replaced by a more suitable sibling. After all, the entire history of early China, as recounted by Lord Zhaowen, demonstrates that enduring political success can be achieved only when succession in a lineage is determined solely by the sonsâ abilities. Consequently, the Zhouxun promotes a model of power transfer, which combines meritocratic and hereditary elements. It appears to react to contemporaneous discussions about the correct principles of succession and to reach a compromise between two antagonistic positions. This standpoint effectively liberates the father-son relationship from the constraints of ritual, which normally stipulates the heirsâ claims to succession. At the same time, the creation of the Zhouxun may have been motivated by concrete political events. In particular, its rejection of primogeniture appears to resonate with the fact that King Zhuangxiang of Qin, who sealed the Zhouâs demise in 249 BCE, was a son by a concubine. Against this background, the Zhouxunâs peculiar historical vision might be viewed as an attempt to legitimise the Qinâs replacement of the Zhou and to praise its leadership (Fech 2023, 71-72 and 204). This context of creation could also explain the Zhouxunâs close parallels with the LÃ¼shi chunqiu, a work compiled under the auspices of LÃ¼ Buwei, who was the driving force behind the installation of King Zhuangxiang.",-340,-240,2041,1505,Andrej Fech,45,Matthew Hamm,2023-08-15 19:31:14.783 +0200,2023-08-23 10:00:54.851 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.007206099784893805,0.0841605801082737,0.18532834652483773,0.355861021335914,0.25087460459462696,0.05157816479069192,0.05048103579205916,0.014509571960120237,5.751085825108283e-07
1924,The Deuteronomistic History,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The so-called âDeuteronomistic Historyâ is a scholarly category that groups the books of Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings for their similar terminology and theological orientation. Martin Noth is often credited with the âdiscoveryâ of the Deuteronomistic History, although connections between the various books had been noted by scholars long before Nothâs own synthesis (See the works of Wellhausen, de Wette, and Ewald). Noth defined the Deuteronomistic History as a history of the nations of Israel/Judah which articulated the theological reasons for Israelâs fall in 722BCE and Judahâs exile in 586BCE. The Judean scribe(s) behind this history maintain that God allowed â perhaps even orchestrated â the fall of Israel and Judah because the kings and the people neglected the terms of the covenant set forth in the book of Deuteronomy. However, scholars like Frank Moore Cross also found more positive themes expressed throughout the âhistoryâ such as Godâs promise to always uphold the Davidic monarchy and the permanence of Godâs presence in the temple in Jerusalem. Other themes that appear frequently throughout the âhistoryâ include warnings against idolatry, the importance of centralizing worship (at the Jerusalem temple), and the complicated nature of kingship. Along with these broad themes, the books within the âhistoryâ share certain terms and phraseology such as âgoing after other gods,â âthe place the LORD will cause his name to dwell,â âwalk in the ways of the LORD,â âkeep the commandments/statues/testimonies/judgements of the LORD,â âdoing good/evil in the eyes of the LORD,â and âfor the sake of my servant David.â (See Weinfeld Appendix A for full list). Overall, the Deuteronomistic History appears to project a Judean perspective which favors the temple in Jerusalem, the Davidic monarchy, and the laws/ covenantal terms in the book of Deuteronomy. However, when analyzing these key phrases, terms, and theological perspectives, it is important to note that no book within the Deuteronomistic history is composed solely of Deuteronomistic themes/phrases, meaning the books themselves remain quite distinct. Moreover, each book employs these themes/phrases in different ways and in different quantities. For example, Deuteronomistic language appears heavily in texts that describe key moments in the history of Israel/Judah. These include the fall of the Northern Kingdom (2 Kings 17), the construction of the Jerusalem temple (1 Kings 8), the establishment of the Davidic monarchy (1 Samuel 12/2 Samuel 7), the reign of Josiah and the discovery of the âLawâ (2 Kings 22), and the fall of Judah (2 Kings 23-25). The books of Judges and Joshua by contrast, contain very little Deuteronomistic phrases/themes, and the language that does appear occurs only in transition points or in speeches (see portions of Judges 1-2, 6, 10, 19-21, and Joshua 23). Thus, it is important to remember that the Deuteronomistic History is merely a scholarly category used to describe the phenomena of shared terms, phrases, and themes across different texts in the Hebrew Bible.

1940,"The Holy Apostles Community, Ori-Oke Iwamimo",43,Religious Group (v6),"The Holy Apostles Community, Ori-Oke Iwamimo was originally called ''The Maran Apostles community.'' It was known by this nomenclature for a little over two decades until it changed to its current name in 1972. Unlike the other dominant theocratic communities in Ilajeland which were started on virgin lands, Ori-Oke Iwamimo had been established by the father of Prophet Wilson Etan Ikudehinbo, the first leader of this theocratic community. Ikudehinbu was a former member of the Ayetoro theocratic community. He left Ayetoro due to some irreconcilable differences between himself and the monarch of Ayetoro in late 1950. By this time, the idea of theocratic settlements was becoming fashionable in Ilajeland due to the initial successes recorded by Ayetoro and Ugbonla. Ikudehinbu was therefore allowed to settle in Ori-Oke iwamimo and to propagate his faith in the manner he deemed fit. By 1951, the community became a theocratic settlement and was led by Ikudehinbu until August 2002 when he passed on. His son, Prophet Alebiosu has led the community since 2004. This was after the fierce leadership tussle which engulfed the community after Ikudehinbuâs demise had been apprehended. 

Ori-Oke Iwamimo community has been quite vibrant in their faith. Their mode of worship is like that found in other theocratic communities in Ilajeland, especially that of Ayetoro. However, they have also developed and maintained other distinct practices which stand them apart from their peers in the Ilaje littoral. Significant among their distinct practices maintained during the lifetime of the first Oba (monarch) is the special annual worship which held at the seashore beside the community church. During the performance of this ritual, the Oba invoked the sea. It is believed in the community that by some uncommon powers he causes the wave to rise and flood parts of the settlement. The Oba stands with his back to the sea while the congregation faces him. As the ritual gets under way, a big bowl is placed on a table in the glare of the people. When the water floods the arena, some of it is retained in the bowl. Special interventions are reported when the water leaps on the congregation. Before the ritual is ended, the water trapped in the bowl is sprinkled on the congregants. It is widely held in the community that the water sprinkled on participants is efficacious in bringing protection, good luck, healing and other favours to the congregants. 

Ori-Oke Iwamimo joins Ayetoro, Ugbonla and Zion Pepe to complete the list of the four most prosperous theocratic communities in Ilajeland. By a series of deliberate actions, the community lobbied the government of the Western State of Nigeria in the late 1960s and early 1970s to request the dredging of the canal which connects it and other villages to the Alape river. This was after it had previously conducted a manual dredging of the same canal with some successes. Ori-Oke Iwamimo remains the only theocratic community among the four most prominent in Ilajeland which has not adopted the use of prayer garments.",1950,2023,2044,1445,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,55,Julian Weideman,2023-08-20 22:24:54.659 +0200,2023-09-14 11:25:29.948 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.0869194982287621,0.14223803861026935,3.624680708495366e-15,0.03245991528669422,0.0017059579121572557,0.6975609575125579,4.777784170396795e-15,0.039115632449550616,1.0481803459024434e-18

1958,The Apostolic Faith Mission in Zimbabwe,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Apostolic Faith Mission in Zimbabwe is a Pentecostal church. Pentecostalism has taken the world by storm and the Apostolic Faith Mission is among churches representing this movement. It is said to be the mother of Pentecostalism in Zimbabwe. Essentially, the church traces its history back to the Azusa experience in America which is believed gave birth to Pentecostalism. An American evangelist by the name John Graham Lake came to South Africa and started the Apostolic Faith Mission South Africa (AFMSA). Zimbabwean mine workers who were working in South Africa got attracted to this form of Christianity and then brought Pentecostalism to Zimbabwe. The Apostolic Faith Mission South Africa then sent some people to be in charge as the church grew. Paul Kruger is amongst the leaders who came from South Africa who played a great role in the establishment of the Apostolic Faith Mission in Zimbabwe. The Apostolic Faith Mission in Zimbabwe was under the administration of AFMSA for a number of years. The leadership was predominantly white during that time. When the leadership was finally handed over to the black Zimbabweans the church has had 4 presidents who were all male. Amongst the first converts were Chiumbu, Masembe, Mutemererwa, Kupara, Mugodhi, Mashavave and the Gwanzura brothers, John, Petros, Enoch and Ezekiel. These also played a big role in planting assemblies throughout the country and are highly regarded in the church even though they are all late. This church is heavily influenced by the patriarchal ideology such that the leadership is predominantly male. Male dominance is highly promoted both in church and at home. Men make decisions and women have to follow and obey. Men can be members of different church boards even if they are not pastors. Female pastors have never held the position of overseer or President (title for the top leader). The church was established in 1915 in Zimbabwe and women constitute the greatest number in terms of membership. Women are said to constitute 60% of the membership whilst men and children constitute the other 40%.The belief in the Holy spirit is central in the church and every member is expected to speak in tongues as evidence of being filled by the Holy spirit. When it was first established the church was characterized by healing and prophecy. This is one of the reason the church took long to be registered because the colonial government was skeptical of the practice of prophecy and miracle working. Amongst the prominent prophets in the early years were women. However as the years have gone by, prophecy and healing have become less practiced.",1915,2018,2058,1437,TERENCE MUPANGWA,57,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,2023-09-11 13:18:32.812 +0200,2024-03-22 11:36:37.110 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),7.829830825526338e-05,0.05625981671840208,1.5269832741509745e-15,0.15261722731893193,1.81663742168168e-05,7.564080753386075e-13,3.9065951003283914e-05,0.715340567523567,0.07564685780486556
1961,"Grace Covenant Centre, Ado-Ekiti",43,Religious Group (v6),"Grace Covenant Centre, Ado-Ekiti, Nigeria grew out of a Christian fellowship membered by some Christian staff of the then Ondo State University, Ado-Ekiti (OSUA) and other categories of civil servants who were resident in the town in the 1990s. The group initially held their meetings at the defunct Ajitadidun premises in the Adebayo area of the town before building their permanent site near their former meeting place. Before organizing this fellowship, the leader of the group, Pastor Felix Aderibigbe had successfully started and groomed the first Pentecostal Christian student fellowship in OSUA in 1984. Grace Covenant Centre was therefore the second Christian group organized by the visionary Christian leader who had previously been engaged in Christian fellowship leadership during his days as a student at the University of Ibadan, Nigeria. 

Being one of the first Pentecostal fellowships in the town, Grace Covenant Centre soon began to attract young, educated and upwardly mobile Christian professionals, businessmen and women and civil servants in Ado-Ekiti. The church which is known for building disciples of Jesus Christ has grown from its Adebayo assembly to open at least three other branches in Ado-Ekiti township. Besides, it has grown through its evangelistic outreach arm to set up a few other branches in other towns in Ekiti State. It also has a branch each in neighbouring Ondo and Ogun States. Being a church made up of academicians, technocrats and top executives in public and private sector, many of its branches are located near university campuses or membered by members of the academic community. It has also organised campus fellowships in universities and other tertiary institutions in Ado-Ekiti and other towns. The fellowship has grown to become one of the most popular Pentecostal movements in the city of Ado-Ekiti. 

The church organises several special programmes and annual conventions. It holds a summer prayer school in June of every year. In this programme, members are taught the principles of strategic prayers and exposed to certain underlying issues that must be addressed by Christians to be victorious in all their endeavours. At some point each year (mostly in February), it celebrates a jubilee crusade. This is a time for proclaiming liberty to those oppressed by sin, Satan and the worldâs system. It celebrates its annual convention (Glory Conference) in the last full week of October. Members from the branches are encouraged to attend the annual convention which is usually power-packed. The church has built relationships with other Christian ministries and their leaders across the country. Leaders of such church ministries are often invited by the church to speak at their special programmes. As a faith community, the church emphasises love, fellowship and building strong horizontal and vertical relationships among members and with God through their Lord and saviour, Jesus Christ.",1990,2023,2064,1445,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,55,Julian Weideman,2023-09-12 13:53:27.561 +0200,2023-09-15 17:53:11.705 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.15841546529729525,0.5539921737372622,4.740065282122709e-16,0.002777534622641826,3.738515838905009e-14,0.2848148029105911,3.6398430081088773e-14,2.3432135314182497e-08,4.015825678909366e-30
1966,Cherubim & Seraphim Movement Church (Worldwide) Ayo Ni O,43,Religious Group (v6),"Aladura is the word for âpraying peopleâ. The Aladura churches are independent African churches or African Instituted Churches (AICs) that emphasize prayer and healing. The Aladura Churches reflects the indigenization of Christianity through the use of African symbols, traditional healing modalities, and worship styles. The Aladura Churches offer solutions to existential problems plaguing humans unlike earlier churches whose emphasis is just the afterlife. The Christ Apostolic Church, the Cherubim and Seraphim, the Church of the Lord, and the Celestial Church of Christ have emerged as the significant arms of the Aladura movement.
The Cherubim and Seraphim Church, one of the Aladura churches, was co-founded by Moses Orimolade and Christiana Abiodun Emmanuel in 1925 through the Praying Band, which was then known as Egbe Aladura. Though a praying group in the first two years of its existence, the church was finally named in 1927.
There were different divisions that ravaged the church after the early years of its existence. Many divisions have taken place among the fold of the Cherubim and Seraphim after its first division in 1929 because of the unresolved differences that ensued between the founders. Even though there were many attempts made at uniting the various divided sections of the church, these attempts failed and had brought about many other factions instead. The church has disintegrated into so many factions, which are also having branches of their own. Also, these factions have their own ways of practices and mode of worship that are peculiar to them.
There are many independent brands of the church in and around Nigeria. This crisis situation of the church led to the forming of a body that is intended to reconcile the various factions and to have one unified Cherubim & Seraphim Church. Thus, the Cherubim and Seraphim Unification Church of Nigeria (C&SUCN) was born. The C&SUCN was founded as the body that intends to bring many of the factional bodies of the Cherubim and Society (C&S) together. It was formed in 1972. 
The C&SUCN took off with five (5) mother churches that include: Eternal Sacred Order of Cherubim & Seraphim; The Praying Band of the Sacred Society of Cherubim & Seraphim; Cherubim & Seraphim Society; The Sacred Cherubim & Seraphim Society; and the Holy Order of Cherubim & Seraphim Movement Church. The name of the section of the C&S Church, Holy Order of the Cherubim & Seraphim Movement Church, was changed to Cherubim & Seraphim Movement Church Worldwide Ayo Ni O.
Today, the Cherubim and Seraphim Movement Church (Worldwide) Ayo Ni O has 1750 branches, 105 districts, and 35 model church/parishes. The Most Senior Special Apostle Prophet Dr. Abiodun Adewale Abidoye JP was appointed as the Acting Spiritual Father and Chairman of Cherubim & Seraphim Movement Church Worldwide Ayo Ni O. The Cherubim & Seraphim Movement Church (Worldwide) Ayo Ni O is one of the five streams of churches under the umbrella all the Cherubim & Seraphim churches. 
And the Cherubim and Seraphim Movement Church (Worldwide) Ayo Ni O, is a significant section of the Cherubim and Seraphim movement which has its tentacles all over the world. The ecclesial practices and theology of the Cherubim and Seraphim Movement Worldwide Ayo Ni O have the same beliefs and practices in all its branches. Each city especially in Southwest Nigeria has a number of branches of this church. For instance, there are are six (6) identified and well-known branches of the Cherubim & Seraphim Movement Church, Ayo Ni O in Ibadan alone. The church is administered by leaders who operate mostly in the prophetic office. Visions, trances and other forms of divine communication between the divine and humans are encouraged among the membership of the church. This is because the practice encourages members of the church to live with confidence that they have fore knowledge of future events and so they do not live in fear of the unknown.",1972,2023,2075,1509,Samuel Okanlawon,57,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,2023-09-15 02:33:24.326 +0200,2024-05-28 23:09:54.013 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.001436389408412549,0.04349245456468567,2.4205253401043623e-15,0.09946488263213588,0.004850084416834748,0.6940968980955915,0.00022582137595037981,0.15643341393136986,5.557501699752987e-08

The Homeric Hymn to Demeter (sequentially the second of the Homeric Hymns) is 495 lines long, making it one of the longest Homeric Hymns. The Hymn to Demeter uses a language and style that is particularly close to that found in the Homeric and Hesiodic epics, so it is usually argued that the Hymn was composed not long after these epics, perhaps between the late seventh century and the middle of the sixth century BCE.

1972,Shepherding Movement,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Shepherding Movement, aka Christian Growth Movement, was a sub movement within the larger Charismatic Movement during the 1970s and 1980s. It was founded by a group of US pastors dubbed the âFort Lauderdale Five:â Don Basham, Bob Mumford, Derek Prince, Charles Simpson, and Ern Baxter. Believing that current churches and pastors were losing sight of the value of discipleship and were caving to worldly practices and cultures, the movement emphasized personal accountability and mentorship where adherents would submit themselves to a âshepherd.â Leaders in the movement required participants to attend additional life group meetings, usually in someoneâs home, and to have shepherds, leaders, and elders approve all life decisions, including but not limited to: marriage, where to live, taking a new job or leaving a current job, or going to the doctor if ill. 
As the Shepherding Movement expanded throughout the United States, networks of communities began to emerge in the shape of a pyramid structure. The networks would meet locally in cell churches. Shepherds would have multiple disciples under them, and those shepherds would be under the authority of shepherds above them. These relationships became known as âcovenant relationshipsâ and the disciple was required to submit in all areas of life and tithe directly to the shepherd who would move the money up the authoritative structure. 
Leaders in the Pentecostal and Charismatic communities began to scrutinize the Shepherding Movement as the movement continued to grow and gain influence. Concerns about tithing to shepherds and the rigid structures of submission and of the covenant relationships were articulated by various pastors throughout the nation. Nationally recognized leaders such as Pat Robertson, Kathryn Khulman, and Demos Shakarian denounced the movement and distanced themselves from the founding leaders. 
By the 1980s, the movement began to fracture as the unity of the leaders disintegrated. Derek Prince and Bob Mumford publicly disassociated from the movement. In 1983, Derek Prince stated that the movement was an error. Bob Mumford publicly asked for forgiveness for his role in the movement in 1989. The movement waned during the 1990s and into the early 2000s as more adherents left the movement citing abuses from leadership. Due to the breakup of the founding leaders, there is little information as to how many adherents remain.",1970,2000,1131,762,Nathan Womack,5,Courtney Fitzsimmons,2023-09-20 23:56:06.385 +0200,2023-10-06 00:52:06.713 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.0003036857640932551,0.026341806773536147,1.778897188823537e-15,0.033433137816339595,0.00013187420492354575,2.2090623598624163e-12,6.549260936274293e-05,0.9113341694201208,0.02838983340941306
1973,The Homeric Hymn to Apollo,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Homeric Hymn to Apollo (Homeric Hymn 3) is one of 33 ancient Greek hymns that were traditionally attributed to Homer, the semi-legendary composer of the Iliad and Odyssey. Today, scholars no longer believe that the Homeric Hymns were composed by the composer or composers of the Iliad and Odysseus, though the hymns do have important stylistic, narrative, and thematic affinities with the epics, by which they were probably partly inspired. The Homeric Hymn to Apollo one of the longer Homeric Hymns. Many scholars have argued that this hymn was originally two separate hymns, namely, a hymn to Delian Apollo that describes the origins and birth of the god on the island of Delos,  and a hymn to Pythian Apollo describing how the god took charge of the oracle at Delphi. Others, however, have argued that the hymn was a unified composition. The archaic language of the Homeric Hymn to Apollo, particularly the first part of the hymn (the hymn to ""Delian Apollo"") has led scholars to argue for an early date of composition, perhaps as early as the middle of the seventh century BCE; the second part of the hymn (the hymn to ""Pythian Apollo""), may have been composed later, in the early sixth century BCE. Walter Burkert has made the argument that the two parts of the hymn were first brought together in 523/22 BCE for a festival that the tyrant Polycrates of Samos celebrated on Delos (in accordance with instructions from an oracle, the festival would have honored both Delian and Pythian Apollo, and would have thus been an appropriate occasion for the unification of the two hymns if they were indeed originally separate).",-655,-522,588,841,Avi Kapach,48,Gino Canlas,2023-09-21 15:29:26.189 +0200,2023-09-21 15:29:26.189 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.20488009177466776,1.0399585883156732e-21,2.335409118524277e-16,1.7010242982292534e-11,7.817201859647228e-28,3.129309072882396e-16,0.7951199082083216,2.9764633939862613e-23,2.4342380492424946e-33

A group of the members of staff of the Teaching Hospital who began to meet to share their Christian faith and conviction decided to organise themselves into a fellowship in the late 1980s. In the early days of the fellowship, they got the leave of the hospital management to meet at a suitable venue within the engineering yard of the Ife hospital unit. From this venue they moved to their permanent site about fifty meters from the second gate of the Ife hospital unit of the hospital.

The church is led by a church council comprising of the senior pastor, other pastors, members of the deaconate, leaders of the various arms of the church as well as other eminent members of the Christian community in Ile-Ife. The council meets annually or when it becomes necessary to take important decisions for the progress of the church. Next to the church council is the pastoral board which meets more regularly to plan the activities of the church and provide leadership for the members. There are several activity groups within the church which members are encouraged to join to achieve the set goals for which the ministry was started.

Membership of the church comprises mainly of the working population of the hospital. The nature of the hospital is such that many of the staff undertake various training programmes to specialise in their desired field of medical and health practice. Many of these individuals worship at the Chapel of Grace during their training and relocate to other towns and cities to settle and practice as professionals. The church has had a highly mobile population over the years. Although several staff settle in permanent jobs in the hospital and continue in the church. They are joined by others who work outside the hospital community but are delighted to identify with the church. The churchâs most celebrated annual programme is the ââPower in the Word Conferenceââ. It is a programme where the word of God (the bible) is dissected and taught passionately. 

Other annual programmes which the church holds include Choir Anniversary, Blissful Home Seminar, a carol at Christmas and special programmes for children, youths, men and women respectively.

1983,Early Byzantine Asceticism,43,Religious Group (v6),"Holy men (Î¸Îµá¿Î¿Ï á¼Î½Î®Ï, also called men, servants, friends or devotees of God) emerged in the East as early as Late Antiquity and the Early Byzantine period. These were individuals that were thought to have been specifically chosen by God so as to spread his word and make him and his intentions present and evident to their contemporaries. In order to come closer to him and gain virtue and purity, holy men abandoned their previous life and practiced repentance and self-mortification through prayer and ascetic labour. 

As they needed to be undistracted to achieve this intimacy with God, holy men withdrew in isolation and lived in social disengagement. This explains their emergence mostly in Syria, due to the areaâs geography and climate. In the Syrian desert, as opposed to that of Egypt, these ascetics had the chance to dissociate themselves from the rest of the world and, at the same time, to survive in a relatively âfriendlyâ environment, where they could more easily find adequate sources such as water and roots, even if they had to constantly be on the move. Consequently, they were able to completely cut themselves off from civilisation, while in the harsher landscape of Egypt they would have to carry with them, and then replicate, the well-known practices and habits of the nearby villages, making the contrast between the two worlds (that in a settled land and that in isolation) less apparent. So holy men left their cities, donated their possessions (which sometimes were many as some of them came from relatively wealthy families) to the poor, cut all ties with, and obligations towards, society, and started a new life without the support of family or friends. In addition, having reached a point where they did not have the same needs as other, âordinaryâ, people even on a physical level, they also managed to live in the open or sometimes in natural shelters in the desert and other barren or abandoned places, fasting or eating only raw vegetables and roots, and, for long periods, staying sleepless and often with no clothes except for a simple shirt. Following this way of life was of course not always easy, and they had to strive in order to complete their mission. During their isolation, they spent their time praying, trying to support themselves by the work of their hands, exercising their body and trying to control the elements of nature as well as their own bodies and passions through hard training (askesis), mortification and voluntary suffering, which can be seen as imitating the passion of Christ, in an attempt to rise above their human existence. It should be noted, however, that holy men did not consider the body itself to be evil, and what they tried to overcome and work against were the human weaknesses. Finally, although not usually mentioned in our sources, the lives of some of them must have been seriously threatened and even lost while practicing asceticism. A substitute death, such as living in a grave-like enclosed space, nonetheless, was a sign of holiness and the ultimate proof that the holy man was now something more than an âordinaryâ person and had moved beyond the normal human condition.   

Although holy men started their askesis by contemplating in isolation, the crowd played a significant part in their lives. Many people would follow them, become their disciples and often form groups or even structured communities with permanent facilities around them, while others would travel long distances to visit them as pilgrims and ask for their help. Ascetics themselves also paid visits to each other and sometimes to nearby villages or cities where they offered their help and, if necessary, they could get a few supplies in exchange for simple repairs. Furthermore, some of them were often asked by the official church to take on positions in the church hierarchy, which they seldom did and only temporarily. Holy men were always ready to participate in the daily life of common people and the social elite in order to protect and integrate that life. However, it was not uncommon for people to be suspicious of them and accuse them of fraud, sorcery and other serious crimes (e.g. murder), even of woes that the community would face in periods of crisis, and holy men had to try to allay them.

The crowd was an essential element in holy menâs lives for an additional reason. Despite their initial withdrawal from the society, after achieving sanctity they had to display signs of it, and the people were the audience they needed in order to exhibit their supernatural powers, as well as those who watched them closely, since they in fact expected to see the evidence that would prove the asceticsâ holiness. Moreover, since holy men sometimes depended on patrons and their gifts and donations, they had to perform miracles for their sake when they were asked to do so. Hagiographers used to place much emphasis on specific incidents from their protagonistsâ lives in order to show their powers, such as blessing and cursing, praying or successfully interceding on behalf of their fellow citizens or even strangers who would ask for their help, and the power of prophecy. The most common sign, however, was that of healing, as holy men were thought to possess the ability to cure a variety of illnesses, both mental and physical. Most of the times they would pray for the sick person or visit them and cure them by touching them, while on other occasions they could send them one of their objects, which had acquired its ownerâs supernatural powers. Furthermore, as many such stories were based on that of Christ from the Gospels, occasionally holy men were presented as bringing a dead person back to life. The relation between the two can also be seen in the second most often proof of the asceticsâ holiness, the conflict with devil. Holy men constantly had to deal with demons who stood in their way, and often had to heal people who had been possessed by such creatures by performing exorcisms. Their victory over these powers was certain, as they ârepresentedâ God, who had given them the ability to handle situations like that. The same is true for encounters with devil himself, who wanted to tempt holy men, distract them from their duties and prevent them from following an ascetic lifestyle. Usually he would do so by reminding them of their previous life they had left behind and all the sacrifices they had made, but the holy men were strong enough to resist him and, eventually, defeat him. 

Lastly, one should briefly also mention the role holy men played in society. The Syrian villages where they first emerged were, at the time, experiencing a decomposition of certain social institutions and a crisis of leadership, and were thus in need of a figure of authority. Therefore, for their inhabitants, holy men assumed the role of powerful rural patrons who would assist them in various aspects of their lives, both in everyday problems and in periods of crisis, while, at the same time, they were more accessible to them than actual patrons. As strangers who were not in any way related to the locals, they also played the role of objective mediators in rural life and sometimes even that of advisors, who reconciled and counselled villagers. Being at the centre of a prayer community as their spiritual fathers, they also offered petitions to God on their behalf, and these people, taking the holy menâs ascetic lifestyle into account, were assured that the latter were close to God and he would therefore hear their prayers. Of course holy men were also considered to be representatives of God, and were thus famous amongst people both in the countryside and in the cities, where they often acquired wealthy patrons themselves. These officials, members of the court or the army and even emperors, assisted and supported them in any way possible and contributed to the rise of their reputation, in exchange for the asceticsâ spiritual guidance and intercession with God. This relationship, as well as the one between holy men and the church authority, was not usually sought after by holy men themselves, who did not accept any offices. However, they gradually moved closer to the ecclesiastical hierarchy, and therefore they also started moving to Constantinople. Finally, it seems that sometimes holy men could work against authorities, namely the emperors, if the latter were usurpers or heretics, in which case the ascetics were regarded as a symbol of opposition to any kind of heresy. In any case, by overcoming their human existence and reaching the apogee of Christian morality, they soon became well-known and an essential part of everyday life in the Byzantine Empire.",400,600,2092,1383,Phoebe Georgiadi,49,Ian Randall,2023-10-05 21:35:22.632 +0200,2023-10-11 21:10:59.474 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.009155300819875537,0.08198126414438694,0.20001008301998952,0.3057057767600175,0.21106600775284504,0.04538260859993393,0.132657799920181,0.014040678970662884,4.800121077209612e-07
1985,Christianity in Antioch. From the Apostolic Era to the Islamic conquest,43,Religious Group (v6),"Antioch has been one of the great centers of Christianity since the times of the New Testament. The origins of Christianity in the city dates from the time of the Apostles. Antioch is mentioned in the Book of Acts (11:26), as the city that the followers of Christ were first ironically referred to as âChristiansâ. In the Book of Acts, which offers an account of the first years of the Church, Antioch is the second most frequently mentioned city. One of the original seven deacons, Nicholas, was a convert from Antioch and perhaps the first Christian from that city (Acts 6:5). During the persecution which led to the death of St Stephen the First Martyr, members of the fledgling Christian community in Jerusalem fled to Antioch for refuge. According to the tradition of the Church, the See of Antioch was founded by St Peter in 34 CE (mentioned in the Book of Acts, 2:26). Peter was either followed or joined by the Apostles Paul and Barnabas, who preached there to both gentiles and Jews, who seem to have been numerous in the city. It was in Antioch that one of the first conflicts within the newly-founded Church developed between Peter and Paul, regarding the necessity of circumcision for male gentile converts to Christianity. The resolution of this conflict, at the Apostolic Council of Jerusalem in 48-50 CE, determined the direction of the Antiochian mission to the gentiles. It was from Antioch, after all, that Paul and Barnabas departed for their first and their second missionary journeys, in 48 CE from Antioch to Cyprus, Antioch of Pisidia, Iconium, Lystra, Derbe; and in 51 CE from Antioch to Cilicia, Lycaonia, Galatia, Troas, Philippi, Thessalonica, Berea, Athens, and Corinth. After spending almost seven years in Antioch, St Peter left for Rome. He was succeeded by Euodius, one of the 72 disciples of Christ, who is thus counted in early episcopal lists as the first successor to the Antiochian Throne of Peter. The See of Antioch produced several important personalities, such as St Ignatius of Antioch, the second successor to Peter, a victorious martyr during the reign of Emperor Trajan and an invaluable historical source for the structure of Church life. His Epistles, written en route to his martyrdom in Rome, bear abundant testimony to the nature of the early hierarchical structure of the Church and to general Church order. In addition to Ignatius, mention must be made of the works of Theophilus (169-182 CE), the sixth successor to Peter, who defended Christian doctrine in his writings against heretics and pagans. At the beginning of the fifth century the Patriarchate of Antioch held ecclesiastical hegemony over a large area including Cyprus, Syria, Palestine, Arabia and Mesopotamia. Though still under some Antiochian influence, the Churches of Georgia and Persia were granted ecclesiastical independence by their Mother Church of Antioch. Antioch could not, however, long hold on to this prestigious position and would lose much to the doctrinal conflicts which either originated there or had as their authors men from the Patriarchate of Antioch. In the fifth century the Patriarch of Constantinople, Nestorius, originated from Antioch, was condemned at the Council of Ephesus (431) for his heretical teachings. Despite this condemnation, many Christians in Persia and the East refused to accept it and broke from Orthodoxy by establishing the Nestorian or Assyrian Church. Furthermore, and during the same century, the Monophysite heresy, whose leading opponent was Saint Cyril of Alexandria, gained a foothold in Syria from where many of its leading and most respected proponents came. The monophysite heresy was condemned at the Council of Chalcedon in 451. However, as in the case of Nestorianism, many Christians including a number of Antiochians refused to accept this condemnation. The subsequent establishment of a Monophysite hierarchy (Jacobite) in the sixth century weakened the See of Antioch. At this same time the geographical extent of the Patriarchate was reduced by decisions of the Ecumenical Councils. In 431 the Church of Cyprus was granted independence from Antioch, and in 451 the Patriarchate of Jerusalem was established and given jurisdiction of Palestine and Arabia. In the early seventh century the Byzantine Empire was threatened by the Persians in the East. In an attempt to reconcile the Orthodox and the Jacobite Monophysites to provide a united front against the invaders, Byzantine Emperor Heraclius proposed the compromise doctrine of Monothelitism. However the Orthodox would accept no political compromise when it came to matters of the Faith and at the Council of Constantinople in 680 Monothelitism was rejected as heresy. Very quickly thereafter Monothelitism died out, except at the Antiochian monastery of Beit-Maroon on the Orontes River (the supporters of this heresy became known as Maronites). These three schisms along with the geographical reduction of the Patriarchate of Antioch reduced the See from its former prestige. The city of Antioch and the Patriarchate continued its decline as the administrative center of Eastern Christianity when it suffered a series of earthquakes, attacks and occupations by hostile cultural and religious elements. The city was captured and ravaged by the Persians in 538-540 and again in 611. After the Byzantine recovery of the area and the defeat of the Persians under Emperor Heraclius, Islam arose as a long range religiously motivated threat to the Christian Byzantine Empire. Antioch was one of the first victories of the advancing wave of Islam, falling in 638.",34,638,2094,1170,Lampros Alexopoulos,49,Ian Randall,2023-10-08 08:02:23.656 +0200,2023-10-08 11:16:52.612 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),1.2258675343361217e-07,0.0015141782507217063,0.0006864485366076154,0.024348565054610454,0.001148970603636115,1.113231086316365e-24,2.3494184252716765e-07,1.6648332025890217e-12,0.9723014800241633

1994,Nigeria Fellowship of Evangelical Students (NIFES),43,Religious Group (v6),"The Nigeria Fellowship of Evangelical Students (NIFES) is an interdenominational Christian movement established in 1968 to cater for the spiritual needs of Christian students in Nigeria's tertiary educational institutions. The body is affiliated to the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students (IFES) and is acclaimed to have affected several hundred lives across the nation. NIFES has established its unit fellowships on several campuses including Universities, Polytechnics and Colleges of Education spread across the six geo-political zones of the country. The group builds disciples, trains and explores the potentials in the young folks who choose to identify with them. NIFES prides itself as an organisation that is in the habit of building tomorrowâs leaders today.

NIFES focuses on evangelism and discipleship. They do this by encouraging members to take part in programmes geared towards soul-winning and disciple-building. At the apex of the groupâs organogram is a Board of Trustees which includes eminent personalities in the nationâs Christian circle. The group is led by a National Director who coordinates the day-to-day activities of the organization. 

NIFES is structured into sub-zones and zones for easy administration. Each zone is coordinated by the Training Secretary who constantly visits campuses in their area ensuring they keep up with the ministryâs cardinal programmes at all times. Each NIFES campus unit is governed by a student executive council elected by the local congregation under the supervision of the Training Secretary. Due to the nature of the group, it is necessary to have change of student executive yearly. This is because while some graduate, others would need to change executive positions and serve in other roles before they also exit the campus at their own time. 

The campus/unit Executive report to the Training Secretary who in turn makes report of the campus fellowships in their area to the regional/national leadership. They hold national programmes at the NIFES National Campgrounds in Kwali, in the outskirts of Abuja, Nigeriaâs Federal Capital Territory. 
To meet her financial obligations, the fellowship relies on funding received from offertory collections taken during fellowship meetings as well as from friends, patrons and other free-will offerings from other categories of people.

1997,Hundred and eighty precepts of Lord Lao,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The âHundred and eighty precepts of Lord Laoâ (Laojun bai bashi jie èåç¾å«åæ) is one of the earliest lists of Taoist precepts dating from the 4th - 6th century. The precepts deal with various themes relating to community life, in which social relationships, living beings, material things and the natural environment are all part of the same coherent whole to be respected. A third of the subjects mentioned, such as theft, murder or debauchery, are similar to the rules of Hinayanist Buddhist disciplines (PrÄtimoká¹£a). These Taoist precepts are moral exercises aimed at individual or collective salvation as well as self-transcendence. Their intoned recitation (songjie èª¦æ) is incantatory psalmody and enables adepts to protect themselves from misfortune, wild beasts, and demons. Two versions of the ""Hundred and eighty precepts of Lord Lao"" appear in the 6th-century Taishang Laojun jinglÃ¼ å¤ªä¸èåç¶å¾ (DZ 786, 2a-20b) and the 8th-century Yaoxiu keyi jielÃ¼ chao è¦ä¿®ç§åæå¾é (DZ 463, 14a-19a).

Part of the text and preface date from the 4th century, and the second part from the 6th century. According to the preface in the Taishang Laojun jinglÃ¼ and its two variants, this list of precepts would be an appendix to the Taiping jing å¤ªå¹³ç¶ revealed by deified Laozi (Lord Lao, Laojun) during the Eastern Zhou dynasty (8th - 3rd c.

1998,The Chinese Christian Scroll Pelliot chinois 3847,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The small, six-sheet Christian scroll, known by its modern pressmark Pelliot chinois 3847, was discovered in the famous Library Cave near Dunhuang. Since its in situÂ acquisition by Paul Pelliot (1878-1945) in 1908, the provenance of this scroll has been well documented. The first published description of the scroll was made in 1909 by Luo Zhenyu ç¾æ¯ç (1866-1940) in his Dunhuang shishi yishu æ¦çç³å®¤éºæ¸ (Lost Books from the Dunhuang Stone Chamber). The next year, Luo published five facsimiles of the texts of the scroll in Shishi bibao ç³å®¤ç§å¯¶ (Secret Treasures from the Stone Chamber). Housed in the BibliothÃ¨que nationale de France, both the texts and materiality of the scroll provide important witnesses to Christianity in Tang China (618-907) and likely through to the time of the Library Caveâs sealing in the early eleventh century. Of such witnesses, A.C. Moule recognized the scrollâs content as being second in importance only to that of the Xiâan Stele of 781. Recent scholarship has favored dating the production of this scroll to after the Tang and before the caveâs sealing, though the composition of at least some of its texts likely date to during the Tang. The scroll contains three distinct texts. The first is titledÂ Daqin Jingjiao sanwei mengdu zanÂ å¤§ç§¦æ¯æä¸å¨èåº¦è®Â (Hymn in Praise of the Salvation Achieved through the Three Majesties of the Luminous Teaching), and is a Chinese translation, in metrical form, of theÂ Gloria in excelsis Deo.Â The hymn remains the only text of the so-called Jingjiao corpus to be a complete translation of a known Christian work. The second text is simply titledÂ ZunjingÂ å°ç¶Â (the Scripture of the Honored) â note that âscriptureâ (jing) here possesses a wider semantic range than just canonized Christian Scriptures. This work begins with an invocation to the Trinity and is followed by a list of honored persons and texts. Some of the Chinese names are transcriptions of foreign words â likely Syriac, in most cases. The third text is a postscript supplying an historical narrative on the translation of Christian works into Chinese. This narrative supplies information that both parallels and complements the Xiâan Stele.  The note likely points to the titles listed in the Zunjing as those of Christian works then existing in Chinese. The note also provides rare information on the original materiality of Christian books before the translation of some of their texts onto scrolls. Regarding material aspects of the scroll itself, red readerâs marks in the hymn text suggest this copy was once used for liturgy. The scroll also evidences being assembled piecemeal, with texts written onto sheets before later being joined to form a single scroll. At the end of the scroll, a red seal with seal characters for Daqin si å¤§ç§¦å¯º, denoting a Christian monastery or church, again suggests this text was used by Christians before entering the predominantly Buddhist context of the Mogao Caves è«é«çª.",635,1000,2103,1524,Daniel Sheridan,45,Matthew Hamm,2023-10-25 21:32:13.127 +0200,2024-01-26 16:13:19.722 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),1.6152131358657633e-27,8.95181946281795e-26,0.10518898200322711,1.6030270564385715e-12,0.00038737414737271604,4.464924307981527e-36,5.657279533454951e-07,1.090632410360933e-33,0.8944230781198438
2000,"The Community Church of Apostles Nigeria and Oversea (COCANO), Ajegunle",43,Religious Group (v6),"In 1933, the Community Church of Apostles Nigeria and Oversea (COCANO) separated from the rapidly growing Aladura movement, a stock of the Cherubim and Seraphim Society introduced to Ilajeland in 1929. The members of the C & S movement in Ilajeland during this period were highly mobile holding their conventions across the towns and villages in Ilajeland. In 1933, they had attended a convention in Ereke. While most members returned to their communities, a group stayed back at the convention venue, making it their home with the intention of continuing there permanently.

The group continued there until a time when the establishment of theocratic communities in Ilajeland gained currency. At this time, they decided to move to the natal town of the groupâs premier leader where enough provision had been made to accommodate them. Their relocation to Ajegunle follows the pattern of Wilson Eran Ikudehinbu who left Ayetoro for former Maran Apostles now Ori-Oke Iwamimo and Lot Korollo who also led his group from his former church location to merge his Christian group with his natal community of Oropo about two miles west of Mahin. 

At Ajegunle, the COCANO has continued to advance their beliefs as its spiritual fervour has had significant impact on the local community. The church holds its conventions, anniversaries and other special programmes in the community boosting local trade and businesses. It advances the global picture of Ajegunle and has continued to place the town on the public stage as the host community of the Christian group. The church has had its fair share of the succession debacle which has plagued most of the theocratic communities in Ilajeland but has found a way to overcome the challenges posed by this widespread problem.  

As with most of the other theocratic communities in Ilajeland, COCANO is organised along several bands for easy coordination and administration. The church appoints leaders for each band. The band leadership is responsible to the Oba (monarch) and the church council for the activities of the group and welfare of her members. Roles are assigned to various bands by the monarch towards the furtherance of the church programmes and agenda. Though there are subtle difference between the COCANO and some other theocratic communities in the area, the group still relates freely with these sister religious settlements within the region. They both offer and receive special invitations to participate in programmes and events marking important milestones in the life and history of one another.",1933,2023,2104,1445,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,55,Julian Weideman,2023-10-26 17:42:49.697 +0200,2023-11-12 08:07:39.804 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.15841546529729525,0.5539921737372622,4.740065282122709e-16,0.002777534622641826,3.738515838905009e-14,0.2848148029105911,3.6398430081088773e-14,2.3432135314182497e-08,4.015825678909366e-30
2001,The Book of Deuteronomy,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The book of Deuteronomy the fifth book of the Hebrew Bible, positioned as the final book of the Pentateuch (Genesis â Deuteronomy), and the first book of the Deuteronomistic History (Joshua â Kings). The book holds a unique position between these two âcollectionsâ and many scholars argue it serves as a bridge between the pre-history of Israel in the Pentateuch and the history of Israelâs monarchy as described in Joshua-Kings. In the Jewish tradition, the book is titled âdevÄrÃ®mâ or âwords,â named after the first few words of the book. In the Christian tradition, the title âDeuteronomyâ comes from the Greek Septuagint and means âsecond lawâ or ârepetition,â as Deuteronomy consistues a second iteration of the law previously given in the Covenant Code (Exodus 20-23). The book of Deuteronomy is structured as several speeches given by Moses to the Israelite community as they leave Egypt and prepare to enter the promised land. The core of the book is chapters 12-26 which contain the core content of the âsecond law.â Michael Coogan suggests that this core is surrounded by a dual introduction (ch. 1-4 and 5-11), two additional speeches (ch. 27-30), a conclusion (ch. 34), and some supplementary poetry (ch. 32:1-44), narrative (ch. 31; 32:45-52), and blessings (ch. 33). Given the bookâs composite nature, scholars agree it was likely composed through several stages of editorial activity over a long period of time. While the dates of these layers are largely unknown, editorial activity likely spanned from as early as the 8th century BCE through the early Persian Period. Several scholars have noted similarities between the book of Deuteronomy and Mesopotamian, Hittite, and Aramaic treaty traditions and law codes. Considering these comparisons, Deuteronomy has come to be understood as a covenant, or treaty agreement between God and Israel, which sets out the terms and conditions of their relationship. The terms and conditions of this agreement include an emphasis on cult centralization, ritual purity laws, proper conduct of religious rituals, criminal laws, and social organization. Overall, the book of Deuteronomy establishes a contract between Israel and God whereby Godâs presence will be guaranteed so long as Israel obeys the various terms and conditions of the contract.",-700,-500,1404,1380,Morganne Ottobre,50,Andrew Danielson,2023-10-26 18:12:07.985 +0200,2023-10-26 18:12:07.985 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),1.1566194132941026e-05,0.04823464501674903,3.915087721829286e-15,0.024314994566629777,0.0013906369500424481,1.4102099349190877e-12,5.062293243305799e-06,0.834907626491756,0.09113546848603242

2006,New Life for All Nations Ministries,43,Religious Group (v6),"New Life for all Nations Ministries is a product of a massive evangelistic push in villages, towns and cities in southwest Nigeria in the early to mid 1970s. The evangelistic work which produced the church was spearheaded by an itinerant preacher by the name, J.K Solomon. Evangelist Solomon had previously been a Police officer in the Nigerian Police Force. He however heeded the call to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ to all nations. He was supported by a band of young and enthusiastic evangelists in the evangelistic campaigns. Together, they travelled across major towns in western Nigeria to preach the gospel and disciple those who accepted their message. They then planted churches in these towns, leaving behind one or a few members of their team to help groom the converts. When members of the newly established church became stable in faith, they also began to launch out to their surroundings to evangelise and further expand the membership of the church. 
The church has its headquarters in Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria from where its branches are coordinated for effective implementation of the church mandate. The vision of the church includes; 
1.	To take the gospel of Jesus Christ to every nation of the world
2.	To plant New Testament churches in every nation and
3.	To disciple the reached for the purpose of reaching un-reached. 

To fulfil its mandate, the church relies on members to engage in personal evangelism as it also organises and conducts mass evangelistic campaigns. It also engages the mass media, new media and other outlets to propagate the gospel. A number of other tools aside evangelism are deployed to ensure the church continues on the path of actualising its dreams. These tools include in-depth study of the scriptures, prayers and other fellowship programs. The church Mission and Pastoral Institute provides training for ministers and missionaries who are designated to lead church branches or those being sent out as missionaries to new or existing missions fields. 

As a means of fulfilling its vision the church holds annual conventions where members from the various branches come together in corporate fellowship to reinforce their collective beliefs and encourage one another unto the burden they all willingly bear. During such periods, the general congregation of the church engages in corporate mission outreach, workshops and specialised seminars which are all targeted towards renewing their resolve and engagement for evangelism (soul-winning). Constitutionally, the term of office of the President or General Overseer is tenured. They have succeeded in having peaceful transition from one leader to the other. The leaders claim that position is a privilege and so should not become a subject of quarrel or strive. They appear to be committed to fulfilling the evangelism mandate they set for themselves above the quest for occupying offices.

2010,Bektashi Tarika,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Bektashi tarika, a Sufi religious order, traces its founding to Haci Bektash Beli, who arrived in Anatolia in the 13th century CE (7th century AH) from Khorasan. The religious order became influential within the Ottoman Empire, in part due to its association with the powerful Janissary corps; Bektashi tekkes, or lodges, were built across the Ottoman Empire, most notably in the Balkans, Anatolia, and the Aegean.

Although the order became powerful in the Ottoman Empire, which officially followed the Sunni Hanafi school, the practices of the order include recognition of the twelve imams, a Shi'ite practice. The group's practices also drew from popular mysticism and incorporated some Christian elements, such as the welcoming of new members with wine, bread and cheese, which is perhaps drawn from the Artotyrite version of Christian communion. The order was led by the Celebi, who lived in the pir-evi (dervish lodge) built over the tomb of Haci Bektash near Kirshehir and Kayseri in central Anatolia.

Influential Bektashi writings include the Makalat of Haci Bektash, which was written in Arabic and later translated into  Turkish. 

Due to the affiliation of the Janissary corps with the Bektashi tariqa, the destruction of the Janissary corps in 1826 by Mahmud II negatively affected the continuation of the order.

As of 1915, Bektashi communities continued to exist in Asia Minor, the Balkans (especially Albania), and the Aegean (see F. W. Hasluck). However, Bektashi tekkes were also built in Cairo, Baghdad, and Karbala. Today, the Bektashi order exists most prominently in Albania.

Both men and women took part in Bektashi rites. Bektashi tekkes, or lodges, were most commonly built on the outskirts of densely inhabited areas; this contrasted with tekkes of other Sufi orders that were more commonly built in urban centers (Hasluck, p. 85-86). An example of this phenomenon can be seen clearly in the old city of Rethymno on Crete: while the Veli Pasha Bektashi lodge was built in the agricultural land outside of the city center, two other Sufi lodges were built within the city shortly after the Ottoman conquest of Rethymno.",1240,2023,2109,1520,Sofia Kane,49,Ian Randall,2023-11-01 15:27:13.935 +0100,2024-04-01 15:31:03.411 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),1.1566194132941026e-05,0.04823464501674903,3.915087721829286e-15,0.024314994566629777,0.0013906369500424481,1.4102099349190877e-12,5.062293243305799e-06,0.834907626491756,0.09113546848603242
2011,Scripture Union Nigeria,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Scripture Union (SU), an interdenominational and non-denominational Christian organization made inroads into Nigeria on January 1, 1885. It was introduced into the country by the Christian Missionary Society (CMS) missionary, Reverend Gollman. He was serving at the Wesley Chapel, Tinubu area of Lagos when he organized the group in the country. Although the group had been created to cater for children who had no access to the church on 2nd June, 1867, it has spread to more than 130 countries across all continents of the world with over 42 of such countries on the African continent.

Rev. Gollman started the Scripture Union in Nigeria with 204 children and continued to grow the membership of the group. However, Christian association was not officially registered in Nigeria until 9th October 1967, a hundred years after the group was originally founded in London by Mr. Josiah Spiers. Since its introduction to Nigeria, the group has influenced several hundreds of children and youths for Christ. The group promotes evangelism and a culture of bible reading among young people and Christian families. The group organises leadership training for churches and schools as well as holiday camps for children and youths. It has made appreciable impact on children of school age through the relentless effort of school visits. 

The group has registered its presence on campuses of tertiary educational institutions in Nigeria through the Scripture Union Campus Fellowship (SUCF). It seeks to both continue the unfinished work of helping young folks they encountered in primary and secondary schools across Nigeria cement their relationship with Christ as well as opening up a fresh opportunity to those who have not encountered them previously. The Scripture Union holds tenaciously to its mission statement which is â¦ ââto reach children, young people and families, nurturing them through bible engagement to become committed Christians of influenceââ.

Through its devotional guide translated into several local languages in Nigeria, the group has affected children, young people and families, enriching their spirits with the moral teachings of the bible. It has helped in moulding many prominent Christian leaders in Nigeria today through the encounters they had with the group in their formative years. The group strives to initiate multiple streams of revival in the life of every inhabitant of the earth. It considers as its most important duty, the reconciliation of men to God so that Godâs peace could ravage every soul, transforming the souls to an enduring home for God where the fragrance of Godâs love and grace emanates to the dying and depraved world.",1885,2023,1082,1445,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,55,Julian Weideman,2023-11-03 14:40:24.462 +0100,2023-11-14 07:46:13.809 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.21357529511744353,0.7514771910947174,1.7295407545385523e-16,0.0020843907362811938,7.012260428186249e-15,0.03286312065739614,6.522286606349554e-14,2.3940890503289247e-09,1.5618726394088638e-30

2021,The United Missionary Church of Africa,43,Religious Group (v6),"United Missionary Church of Africa (UMCA) is a Mennonite denomination that arrived in Nigeria in 1905.  The founding missionaries, whose society is known as United Missionary Society (UMS) came from the United States of America and Canada in the first half of the twentieth century.  Their home church was known as the United Missionary Church (UMC). UMC was initially known as Mennonite Brethren in Christ (MBC). Apart from its Mennonite background, the denomination was also heavily influenced by Methodism. The first missionary in Nigeria was Rev. A.W. Banfield who arrived in Nigeria in 1905.  He was well-known for reducing the Nupe language to writing, publication of Nupe Dictionary and the translation of the Bible into Nupe language.  Other missionaries such as L.R. Sloat, W. Bontrager, G. Schroeder, J. McDowell, L.K. Fuller,  and many others also joined Banfield in planting the denomination in Nigeria. The activities of the missionaries was not limited to preaching the gospel, it also included healthcare and education.  The denomination however, is well-known through its major Seminary, the UMCA Theological College, Ilorin, which trains clergy, not only from the owner denomination, but from all Protestant churches, including those from African independent churches.  Apart from Nigeria, the UMS also established churches in countries of Central America, South America and Asia
The labours of the UMC missionaries in Nigeria resulted in the United Missionary Church of Africa becoming a distinct denomination in the country in 1955. On September 29, 1956, the denomination became a registered corporate body in Nigeria.  With the support of indigenous missionaries, the denomination spread from central Nigeria to the North west and South western Nigeria.  Today the Church is well established in ten states of the thirty six states in Nigeria, including, Lagos, Oyo, Osun, Kwara, Niger, Kogi, Kebbi, Kaduna, Plateau and Nasarawa States.  UMCA can also be found in some other African countries, such as Sierra Leone, Liberia and Cote DâIvoire.  The UMS handed the running of the denomination to indigenous leaders on January 5, 1978 in a service held at the Theological College, in Ilorin.
The national leader of the denomination is titled the President, who is elected every four years.  A president can use two terms of four years each; thus a President cannot spend more than eight years in office.  The regional leaders are called Church District Superintendent (CDS).  At present (2023) the church has thirty four (34) Church District Superintendents, in ten states of Nigeria.  The District Superintendents are also elected for a term of four years, renewable for another term.  Under the District Superintendents are the Area Church Councils (ACC), and then the local Churches.  Apart from the Offices, there are standing committees and Boards, overseeing the different aspects of the denominationâs activities.

2027,Hizb-ut-Tahrir,43,Religious Group (v6),"Strongly linked to the political thought of the Palestinian intellectual Taqi al-Din al-Nabhani, Hizb-ut-Tahrir originated in the early 1950s between Palestine and Jordan. In the turbulent post-Second World War Middle East, al-Nabhani identified the structural causes of the Arab world's crisis -manifestly evident in the Nakba and the foundation of the Israeli state- in secular Arab politics and invoked the foundation of a group or party actively pursuing the restoration of the Islamic Caliphate. Hizb-ut-Tahrir is now present in the Middle East and North Africa. Since the mid-1970s, it has also been rooted in Southeast East and Central Asia, as well as in Britain, Germany, and Austria. Despite such internationalization, the movement has never gained substantial political weight anywhere due to its uncompromising rhetoric and refusal of democratic means. It is currently banned in most Arab and non-Arab countries, for it is hard to determine the actual size of the movement globally or in the national branches. Al-Nabhani remained the uncontested leader of the group until he died in 1977, followed by Abdul Qadeem Zallum until 2003 and Ata Abu Rashta since then.
Typifying Hizb-ut-Tahrir in a clear-cut analytical category is problematic since, despite its self-representation as a proper party, al-Nabhani indifferently used the Arabic term 'kutla' -group- and 'hizb' -party- in interpreting the Quran's relevant sections. Still, in the movement's conceptual backbone, the notion of ""hizb"" did not have a pejorative meaning as in antecedent Islamic reformists' understanding who, instead, rebuffed political parties as being a byproduct of Western Modernity. 
Historically, Hizb-ut-Tahrir is a clear byproduct of the XX century's Middle Eastern sociopolitical evolutions. It profoundly resented from both the interwar period and the immediate post-colonial decades. From the latter, distinctly came a vocal anti-colonialism directed against local Arab regimes culpable of having adopted Western forms of government. From the first, al-Nabhani drew inspiration for setting up pyramidal structures and rigid modes of action that closely featured the Syrian and Iraqi Ba'ath parties. In any society in which it is present, Hizb-ut-Tahrir's actions follow a well-detailed five-step strategy designed by al-Nabhani himself. In the panorama of local and coeval Islamist political activism, Hizb-ut-Tahrir represented a sort of 'third way' between classic Islamic modernist groups, namely the Muslim Brotherhood, and radical Islamism, palpably gaining momentum after Sayyd Qutb. Contrary to Hassan al-Banna's organization, al-Nabhani preferred very rigid political activism to grassroots organizations, always rejected democratic participation and refused a ""gradualist"" approach in favour of a revolutionary rupture as for Qutb. However, opposed to Qutbism, Hizb-ut-Tahrir never endorsed the notion of ""jahiliyya"" and rejected violent jihadi practices. Al-Nabhani's thought largely remained non-violent, advocating for an intellectual revival of ordinary people instead. Much of Hizb-ut-Tahrir's activities consist of study-circles for the indoctrination of novices and the creation of an intellectual vanguard to make proselytism in society. The restoration of the Caliphate would be consequential to these steps in the movement's vision. 
Besides clandestinity and state repression, Hizb-ut-Tahrir failed to gain political weight for internal reasons. First, the very rigid structure reduced adaptation capacity in ever-moving sociopolitical scenarios. Second, the proposal of an ideological reformation limited the ability to compete with other political groups endorsing more practical solutions to people's everyday needs, such as Hamas, the Muslim Brotherhood, or Jama'at al-Islamyya in Southeast Asia.

2038,"Cathars, Catharism, Albigenses, Albigensians, Cathari, Catharistae, ""Pure Christians""",43,Religious Group (v6),"The Cathars were a heterogeneous heretical sect in medieval Europe. The groups and their beliefs have been identified by various names (Cathars, Catharism, Albigenses, Albigensians, Cathari, Catharistae) and the heresy is identified with different groups across history. The term was used in the Late Antiquity to refer to various heresies: ""Cathari"" was used of the Novatianists by Saint Epiphanius and other Greek Fathers, while Augustine used the term ""Catharistae"" to describe a sect of Manichaeans. The term primarily applies to a collection of groups in medieval Europe (12th to 14th centuries) that espoused a gnostic and dualist system of belief that was regarded as heresy by mainstream Christianity in the medieval West (Roman Catholicism) where these beliefs can be traced. The group referred to itself, at times, as ""Pure Christians"". The sect is also referred to as the âAlbigensiansâ or âAlbigensesâ (after Albi in southern France).

The dualist belief system of Catharism centred on the idea of two eternal and coeval divinities, gods, forces or principles: one good and one evil. Spirits are created by the good and matter by the evil principle. When spirits fell from goodness, they were imprisoned in bodies and in death moved from one to another until their badness was expiated and they could return to heaven. The Cathars rejected the organised Church, its authority, its sacraments, and its interpretation of scripture. The group was extremely strict in its religious practices: rejected marriage, the consumption and use of meat and animal products, and recommended an extreme form of fasting (âenduraâ) that led to starvation and death. They believed that Christ was an angel with a non-physical body, that He did not suffer and die, and that His redemptive act was to spread the true (Albigensian) doctrine. They lived in two religious casts: a more austere group, the âperfectâ, who received their baptism (âconsolamentumâ) by the laying on of hands by which members recipients became the ""perfecti"", and the ordinary believers who would receive âconsolamentumâ before dying. 

The belief system was based around Christianity, but also incorporated ideas from  different Christian heretical sects including Sabellianism and Arianism. Similarities of belief can be seen with a number with a number of other heresies with which the group was frequently linked. Catharism was influenced by the Bogomils, a comparable Eastern gnostic dualist sect that emerged in the first Bulgarian empire in the 10th century. Catharism may have developed in Byzantium under influence from Armenia and Persia. Catharism emerged in Germany in the 12th century and also in Italy, primarily in the region of Milan. They appeared in the Languedoc region of France around Albi in the 11th century and were also to be found in the Champagne region. Thirteen clerics were condemned to death at the Council of OrlÃ©ans in 1022. A crusade and later inquisition was launched in the early 13th century and all traces of Cathars had been expunged by the 14th century.",1000,1300,2138,1422,John Gallagher,49,Ian Randall,2023-11-22 22:54:42.992 +0100,2023-11-26 03:31:38.584 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.00015359674984845027,0.005400473628375111,0.018825816779577318,0.313453880138691,0.662108892076953,6.205565113714547e-12,5.416383470843246e-05,1.8190427987546625e-12,3.176783821862926e-06
2039,Psalm 109,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Psalm 109 belongs to the fifth section of the Masoretic text's version of the book of Psalms (Pss 107â150), which begins the third part of the canon of the Hebrew Bible (known as the Writings, or kÄtÃ»bÃ®m). The book of Psalms (called tÄhillÃ®m or ""Praises"" in Hebrew) is an anthology comprising psalms of various origins, which were eventually edited into a codified collection. The earliest copies of Psalm 109 were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls. It appears in the Great Psalms Scroll (11Q5), which dates to 30â50 CE and reflects a different ordering of the psalms than the MT. It has been categorized as a psalm of individual complaint, the most common type of biblical psalm. Written in poetic language, Psalm 109 is one of 72 psalms in which David's name appears in the superscript, and, like the rest of Psalms, its authorship was traditionally attributed to him. Its actual origins and date of composition are unknown, though some have suggested it exhibits Persian influence, as well as a focus on the (restored) Temple, and thus dates to the late 6th century BCE (Gillingham 2022). Following a brief lament in vv. 2â5, Psalm 109 asks for Yahweh's retribution against those who have attacked the main speaker with false accusations and aggression for no discernible reason. The series of curses that follow in vv. 6â19 may be those of the supplicant or those of his antagonists. The prayer continues with another lament and a request for YHWH's intervention (vv. 20-29), and concludes with the promise that the supplicant will publicly praise YHWH for delivering him.",-1000,50,2240,1532,Jennifer Singletary,50,Andrew Danielson,2023-11-23 02:28:25.699 +0100,2024-03-06 20:39:58.808 +0100,Prayer in the Ancient World,0.0032975781453505673,0.443217104308979,2.922774876254977e-15,0.11059759619101668,0.00010459263129239236,1.2962494625408616e-12,0.0023729174855251227,0.39372105436628374,0.046689156870253344

2051,Tibeto-Vietnamese Äáº¡o Máº«u,43,Religious Group (v6),"This entry explores a modern syncretic Äáº¡o Máº«u that is mixed with Tibetan elements, which we call Tibeto-Vietnamese Äáº¡o Máº«u. While many elements are shared and generalizable about Äáº¡o Máº«u more broadly, this entry is restricted mostly to specific elements that reflect the integration of Tibetan Buddhism, specifically the Sakya lineage (since its introduction in Vietnam in the 1990s). Of key interest is the transposition of Tibetan deities onto a Vietnamese goddess cosmology within a Tibetan ritual space. This is arguably (and likely) the only ethnographic example of this in Vietnam (and probably the world). Tibeto-Vietnamese Äáº¡o Máº«u emerges from a much longer history of folk religious practice (tÃ­n ngÆ°á»¡ng dÃ¢n gian) of worshipping mother goddesses, based on Vietnamese oral traditions, legends, folk songs and popular stories. Tibeto-Vietnamese Äáº¡o Máº«u is a complex pantheistic belief system that syncretizes both Mahayana and Tibetan Buddhism, Daoism, Confucianism and ethnic minority religious practices, and reflects the preservation of indigenous Vietnamese culture and heritage. It stems from an older tradition for which there is no consensus about the exact date of (16th century is conventionally given). Mother goddesses are spirit deities derived from different ethnic minorities and historical figures, including those who fought to protect the country from military and political invasion, and are present in both Tibetan Buddhism and conventional Äáº¡o Máº«u. Tibeto-Vietnamese Äáº¡o Máº«u is organized in a way congruent with larger expressions across Vietnam.  There is a supreme high god, ThÃ¡nh Máº«u (Mother Goddesses), sometimes supervised by Ngá»c HoÃ ng (Jade Emperor) or Pháº­t BÃ  Quan Ãm (Avalokiteshvara). Each holy mother is a ruler of a realm (called âprefectureâ or phá»§). There are four phá»§ comprising the universe: ThiÃªn phá»§ (Prefecture of Heaven), Äá»a phá»§ (Prefecture of Earth), Thoáº£i phá»§ (Prefecture of Water) and Nháº¡c phá»§ (Prefecture of Mountains and Forests). The highest level of Tibeto-Vietnamese Äáº¡o Máº«u's pantheon (hÃ ng chÆ° thiÃªn) is QuÃ¢n Ãm (Guan Yin) depicted in female form. The second level are the four heavenly fathers (tá»© vá» vua cha), followed by three or four palaces of mother goddesses. Below the mother goddesses are great mandarins (quan lá»n Äá»), princesses (thÃ¡nh cháº§u), princes (thÃ¡nh hoÃ ng), thÃ¡nh cÃ´ (saintly ladies), and thÃ¡nh cáº­u (boy attendants). LÃªn Äá»ng is the iconic mediumship ceremony associated with Vietnamese folk rituals, including Tibeto-Vietnamese Äáº¡o Máº«u, that incorporates singing and dancing while channeling a series of supernatural beings into the mediumâs physical body. It brings alive mythical and historical personages, such as Tráº§n HÆ°ng Äáº¡o, a military general who fought and protected the country from the Mongol invasions in the 13th century. As our analysis extends, Tibeto-Vietnamese Äáº¡o Máº«u is a contemporary example of gender fluid mediumship, a phenomenon which has been widely analyzed by anthropologists in other ethnographic domains. This entry is based on 8 months of in-person fieldwork and close, on-going connection with Sakya Vietnam since 2021.",2022,2024,2175,576,Stephen Christopher,5,Courtney Fitzsimmons,2023-12-05 14:21:08.772 +0100,2024-04-24 16:01:43.350 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.7436292661031847,0.15343107779326956,3.5810410666267626e-14,0.03726685602584621,0.0010130435465946878,0.06103571305792481,1.3627825931212438e-12,0.003624043471781296,3.617588297239654e-19

There are diaspora members in the United States of America, the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, and Canada.  
A brief background history of the Hospital Christian Fellowship that led to the formation of Christ Way Church is in order. Hospital Christian Fellowship began as a result of the activities of some young Christian graduates from Universities in Nigeria in the middle of the 1970s, who found jobs in the teaching hospital, and began a fellowship group in IlÃ©-IfÃ¨. This fellowship group, which started specifically in 1976, comprised of young people from various denominations (Anglican, Baptist, and Methodist,), who were mainly hospital workers in IlÃ©-IfÃ¨. Their goal was to meet and discuss the Bible and evangelize their immediate hospital environment. The names of these young graduates at that time are: BÃ¡dÃ© Nwakpa (a Pharmacist), Niyi ArÃ³wÃ³lÃ² (an Engineer), Philip O. ÃgÃºnnÃ³wÃ² (a Medical Doctor), Christopher ÃpÃ¡pÃ©jÃº (a Secondary School teacher) and his wife OpÃ©OlÃºwa ÃpÃ¡pÃ©jÃº (a hospital secretarial staff) and finally Uche Onwudiegu (a Medical Doctor). At its initial stage, the group adopted a rotational presidency. Niyi ArÃ³wÃ³lÃ² was the first president; at the expiry of his tenure, Philip O. ÃgÃºnnÃ³wÃ² took over from him and was the president until when Samuel OdÃºnlÃ¡mÃ¬ OrÃ­Ã²kÃ¨ joined the group in 1983. In October, 1983, OdÃºnlÃ¡mÃ¬ OrÃ­Ã²kÃ¨ took over as the president after a three-day fast and he maintained the position until 1992 when the fellowship changed its status to a Church. 
The hospital group met for their fellowship activities on the premises of the Seventh Day Adventist (henceforth SDA) Hospital, which the Federal Government acquired from the SDA mission and made an extension of the Ife University Teaching Hospital Complex (IUTHC), to train medical students. The group met on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Tuesdays were for Bible study, while Thursdays were for prayer meetings. The fellowship was meeting inside one of the School of Nursingâs classrooms. When the classroom was in use by the School of Nursing, the fellowship group often moved to other available venues, such as the General Outpatient Department (GOPD) or the corridor of the Hospital Laboratory Department. During the early days of the meetings, the hospital management did not oppose the activities of the members of the group nor did they interfere with their meetings, until the group grew. 
Until OdÃºnlÃ¡mÃ¬ OrÃ­Ã²kÃ¨ joined in 1983, the Hospital Christian Fellowship (HCF) had just a few members, no more than 15 in all. By the time he joined the group, he introduced radical evangelism within and outside the hospital premises. What is meant by radical evangelism here is the use of different methods such as tract distribution (especially Four Spiritual Laws), bus evangelism, and drama evangelism and so on, to present the gospel to the people. Evangelism was no longer confined to the four walls of the hospital; coupled with bed-to-bed hospital evangelism, there was the house-to-house evangelism, which took the group out of the hospital premises into the community around the hospital. 
Some members of the SDA church became members of the fellowship. This was the beginning of the travail of the fellowship, because the SDA Churchâs council rose up and in fact instigated the hospital management to take a stand against the fellowship. The leaders of the fellowship at the time who were also medical doctors in the same hospital pleaded with the hospital management. The matter dragged on until the end of 1986 when the fellowship was eventually kicked out of the hospital premises. 
Some of the members who were head teachers at the SDA Grammar School (High School) gave the leadership of the fellowship permission to use the schoolâs classrooms for its weekly activities. In 1988, when the Federal Government of Nigeria returned back the hospital and the school initially taken from them,   the SDA church council served the Fellowship with a note to vacate the premises. This meant that the group was going to lose its identity by striking out the phrase, âHospital Christian,â from its name. When the fellowship moved from the hospital premises to the school premises, many non-hospital workers, such as Akin ÃgÃ¨, T.O. OyÃ¨bÃ­sÃ­, TÃºndÃ© OkÃ¹nadÃ©, and other influential individuals, had joined the group and also occupied leadership positions of the fellowship. Some members of the fellowship who belonged to the Methodist Church of Nigeria, ObalÃ¹fÃ²n, IlÃ©-IfÃ¨, appealed to their churchâs council to grant permission for the fellowship to hold its weekly meetings on Methodist property. The Church Council granted temporary permission in 1988. The fellowship changed its name to Christ Way Fellowship (CWF) at the end of the year 1988.  Because the permission granted the fellowship was not stipulated in writing, some members of the Methodist Church who felt threatened by the activities of the fellowship complained about the inconvenience created by the CWF.
The CWF moved out of the Methodist Church at the end of 1989 and established its home where its present headquarters is located at Temipemi Street, Iredapo Quarters, IlÃ©-IfÃ¨. The place is a three-acre land with an old church and an uncompleted apartment complex within it. The place was bought from its original owner, who was also using it for the churchâs activities. The fellowship leaders, having purchased this property where fellowship activities could be held without any hindrance, began to operate as a pseudo-church. I use the word pseudo here because the organization had already been operating as a church without any official recognition by the Federal Government of Nigeria. Fellowship activities were no longer restricted to two days of the week, but were extended to about four days, namely Mondays, Prayer Meetings; Tuesdays, Bible Study; Thursdays, Deliverance Hour, and Sundays, Home Cell leadersâ meetings (House Fellowship). Home Cell was already a part of the programs of the HCF when they met at the hospital premises. Seeing all these kinds of activities, many church leaders in the town of IlÃ©-IfÃ¨ had begun to insinuate that OdÃºn OrÃ­Ã²kÃ¨, the leader of the CWF, was already nursing the ambition to start a church. Maybe they were correct, as events that led to the formation of the church confirmed what the public and some members of the Orthodox churches had already suspected.",1992,2023,2147,1533,Enoch Gbadegesin,57,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,2023-12-06 11:47:21.171 +0100,2024-01-24 19:15:13.646 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),1.2258675343361217e-07,0.0015141782507217063,0.0006864485366076154,0.024348565054610454,0.001148970603636115,1.113231086316365e-24,2.3494184252716765e-07,1.6648332025890217e-12,0.9723014800241633

A brief background history of the Hospital Christian Fellowship that led to the formation of Christ Way Church is in order. Hospital Christian Fellowship began as a result of the activities of some young Christian graduates from Universities in Nigeria in the middle of the 1970s, who found jobs in the teaching hospital, and began a fellowship group in IlÃ©-IfÃ¨. This fellowship group, which started specifically in 1976, comprised of young people from various denominations (Anglican, Baptist, and Methodist,), who were mainly hospital workers in IlÃ©-IfÃ¨. Their goal was to meet and discuss the Bible and evangelize their immediate hospital environment. The names of these young graduates at that time are: BÃ¡dÃ© Nwakpa (a Pharmacist), Niyi ArÃ³wÃ³lÃ² (an Engineer), Philip O. ÃgÃºnnÃ³wÃ² (a Medical Doctor), Christopher ÃpÃ¡pÃ©jÃº (a Secondary School teacher) and his wife OpÃ©OlÃºwa ÃpÃ¡pÃ©jÃº (a hospital secretarial staff) and finally Uche Onwudiegu (a Medical Doctor).

The fellowship leaders, having purchased this property where fellowship activities could be held without any hindrance, began to operate as a pseudo-church. I use the word pseudo here because the organization had already been operating as a church without any official recognition by the Federal Government of Nigeria. Fellowship activities were no longer restricted to two days of the week, but were extended to about four days, namely Mondays, Prayer Meetings; Tuesdays, Bible Study; Thursdays, Deliverance Hour, and Sundays, Home Cell leadersâ meetings (House Fellowship). Home Cell was already a part of the programs of the HCF when they met at the hospital premises. Seeing all these kinds of activities, many church leaders in the town of IlÃ©-IfÃ¨ had begun to insinuate that OdÃºn OrÃ­Ã²kÃ¨, the leader of the CWF, was already nursing the ambition to start a church. Maybe they were correct, as events that led to the formation of the church confirmed what the public and some members of the Orthodox churches had already suspected.",1992,2023,2147,1533,Enoch Gbadegesin,57,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,2023-12-06 11:47:21.171 +0100,2024-01-24 19:15:13.646 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),1.8280219682774377e-05,0.22044255041031027,5.926508909216604e-15,0.4279652058858376,0.009131178617849369,0.19663431377049115,1.3494021244286058e-05,0.1457943609798857,6.160946930219602e-07

The specific concerns are couched in the form of polar or yes/no questions, the concatenation of which insured comprehensive coverage of the queryâs general topic. Although military and security-related matters are the most common topics of tamitu-queries, other topics include the outcome of a hunt, the appearance of a lunar eclipse, the acceptance of a gift, and a pregnant womanâs successful delivery, among others. The present text asks Shamash and Adad about the supplicantâs Å¡ulmu (Akk., âwholeness, completenessâ) over the course of a year.

2061,OYA RELIGIOUS GROUP IN OYO,43,Religious Group (v6),"Oyo people are a distinct linguistic group among the Yoruba race. They had one of the strongest military among the Yoruba prior to colonial rule. They held strongly to their traditional religious views which, as they claimed, helped in their successful military campaigns. They are found in present day Oyo state, Nigeria. Their population is about 471,000. From oral history, the town was founded by Oranmiyan the last son of Oduduwa, the great ancestor of the Yoruba people. Generally, the religious and political history of the people can be traced to their migration from Ile-Ife. But more specifically, they have a ritual tradition which is spectacular. It is attached to Sango and Oya festivals. Oya was the wife of Sango during his life time. In cosmological understanding of Orisa belief, she was such an outstanding figure among the female deities. Her imposing pedigree therefore makes her group to be unique.  The group showcases her festival with Bata drum as it makes it distinct for ritual practices. This unique ritual practice of the Oya group is shared with the Sango group. Oral tradition has it that Oya was one of the deities sent to the earth by Olodumare for creation and earth-remodelling. She is reputed for her fearlessness and believed to live in or inhabit the wind. Oya is known for her reputable character as a warrior and as a mother that loves children. Oya is a goddess that professes love in her character. This is seen from the way she stood with her husband, Sango, in the time of crisis. She is a mother who protects her children from any form of danger because she accords wealth to them and does not support hypocritical acts and betrayal. Rather, she loves people who are truthful and those who possess a pure heart. A mythical narrative made it clear that Oya was so faithful to to Sango, her husband that she alone of all his wives accompanied him in his flight towards Nupeland in his time of crisis. Oya, according to the myth could not bear the pain of her husband's disappearance after his death that she committed suicide. This act was her way of sharing in her husband's destiny. she died in her hometown, Ira and was thus deified. The Oya group has a well developed religious cult on the River Niger in Nigeria to symbolize her heroic acts. The cult is still devoted to their practices till today. While Sango is recognized as the spirit of thunder and lightning, Oya is known to be the spirit of wind. Sango is acknowledged for fierce tornadoes and intense thunderstorm while Oya is reputed for her windstorms which uproot trees and destroy houses. Oya is seen as a deified heroine and never spoken of as dead. Her votaries still belief that she is still living. She is not dead as she is both a deity and an ancestor who protects and watches over her living children or followers. The Indigenous religious festival, Ãá¹£áº¹Ìá¹£e is performed by her group. This has been incorporated into some new religious traditions among some African groups in the Diaspora.",1800,1900,1995,1460,olusegun oladosu,57,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,2023-12-15 14:28:33.366 +0100,2024-03-06 19:51:18.186 +0100,Personal Expertise,0.996202476180818,2.3701781146043474e-13,1.940672526045761e-15,0.0016981803709339664,3.506903840905286e-05,0.001982941395164391,4.3403090683935143e-14,8.133301439211057e-05,1.0325644887733776e-20

2070,Overcomers Evangelical Mission International (Ori-Oke Asegun),43,Religious Group (v6),"This is an entry on the Overcomers Evangelical Ministry International, commonly known as Ori-Oke Asegun, which is a vibrant religious organisation with its roots firmly planted in IlÃ©-IfÃ¨, Nigeria. Founded by Prophet/Evangelist Abiodun Oladele, the ministry has grown to become a significant spiritual force, impacting the lives of its members and the surrounding communities. Prophet/Evangelist Abiodun Oladele serves as the visionary and spiritual leader of the Overcomers Evangelical Ministry International. With a compelling personal story of divine calling and obedience to the divine will, Prophet Oladele's teachings emphasise the power of faith, prayer, and divine intervention in overcoming life's challenges. The ministry is characterised by distinctive practices, most notably the emphasis on the colour white. Prophet Oladele, following divine guidance received in a dream, adheres to an all-white attire during ministry activities, including the use of a white microphone. This commitment to the colour white symbolises purity, obedience, and the manifestation of God's power, which have seen so many of his followers adorning themselves in the use of white colour. 
The ministry conducts regular church services and gatherings where members come together for worship, prayer, and teachings. The services are known for their spiritual intensity, with an emphasis on the manifestation of God's power, healing, and deliverance. The teachings revolve around the scriptures, particularly emphasising the power of Christ Jesus to heal any kind of diseases whatsoever. Prophet Oladele, having experienced divine encounters and revelations, incorporates prayer and spiritual interventions for healing. The ministry has witnessed reported cases of miraculous healings, further reinforcing its reputation as a place where the supernatural is believed to be at work.
The ministry has expanded beyond its initial establishment in IlÃ©-IfÃ¨. Branches have been established in various locations, including Osun State, with notable locations such as Ipetumodu and Gbongan. Additionally, within IlÃ©-IfÃ¨, the ministry has extended its reach with branches in Aworeni, Opa, Eleyele, Akarabata, Abajaolowu (Modakeke), Ondo road, Arubiewe, and Epe. This geographical expansion reflects the ministry's commitment to reaching and impacting diverse communities with its spiritual message. Beyond religious activities, the Overcomers Evangelical Ministry International engages in community outreach. These outreach programmes serve as meeting points for individuals to gather, fostering a sense of community and providing opportunities for people to study the Bible and engage in spiritual discussions.
It could be said that the Overcomers Evangelical Ministry International, under the leadership of Prophet/Evangelist Abiodun Oladele, stands as a testament to the transformative power of faith and obedience. With its distinctive practices, commitment to spiritual growth, and a focus on community impact, the ministry continues to play a significant role in the spiritual landscape of IlÃ©-IfÃ¨ and beyond.",2003,2018,2017,1451,Oluwasegun Aluko,57,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,2023-12-19 17:17:38.000 +0100,2024-02-22 14:22:33.629 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.00040761062357431776,0.10223792521578688,2.286853904036602e-15,0.49973705245230277,0.0007353651688266295,0.26158548394358927,0.0001482574452254223,0.13514814216367627,1.6298701611805988e-07
2071,"Songs of the Sage (4Q510, 4Q511)",52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Songs of the Sage, a collection of hymns attributed to the Maskil (Hebrew word for instructor or sage â in this case referring to a sectarian Jewish leader of the community at Qumran) for the sake of warding or protection of the prayerful against evil, is an exemplar of early Jewish apotropaic prayer. The two known witnesses to the composition, 4Q510 and 4Q511, are dated between 30 BCE and 30 CE. Of the two manuscripts, 4Q510 contains only a few legible lines within its fragments, whereas 4Q511 consists of 226 fragments, yielding the majority of the textual material associated with the Songs. The fragmentsâ composition style, language, and format hint that the Songs were used in group study or performance as part of a communal ritual. Though there is no reference to the specific occasion of the ritualâs performance, scholars think that the sectarian community at Qumran may have regularly recited apotropaic prayers, of which the Songs of the Sage is a key example. At least three songs are included within the text (though there are indications of several others), and all contain references to the Maskil. At least three of the Songs feature apotropaic incantations or other phrases used to prevent harm from evil spirits and demons. Throughout the texts, praises and thanksgivings are interwoven along with incantations primarily for the sake of praising the Jewish God, with the secondary feature of serving as magic âwords of powerâ that invoke fear in demons and spirits, providing protection from them. In this way, the Songs differ from the contemporary Jewish magical practices involving addresses to the Jewish God and invocation of his name(s) for divine protection. The Songs share some elements of other apotropaic prayer in Second Temple and rabbinic Judaism â protection from Satan/evil, protection from sin and forgiveness for it, sanctification, and the inspiration of Godâs knowledge and laws to his followers. Yet they stand apart for the ways they reflects the culture of the Qumran community in their dualistic and apocalyptic framework and references to beliefs and practices characteristic of the sect.",-30,30,2248,1539,Joseph Angel,58,Jennifer Singletary,2023-12-19 19:27:11.912 +0100,2024-02-27 21:29:34.109 +0100,Prayer in the Ancient World,0.008312696759609923,0.25324588573465073,3.791162647397565e-15,0.3204097578692452,0.003905030370266177,0.3437816198171392,0.0017369950549737483,0.06860792161148206,9.278262918317761e-08
2072,Unguja Ukuu Amulet Seal,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Archaeological excavations in 2018 at the site of Unguja Ukuu (Zanzibar) yielded a small rock-crystal cabochon amulet seal with the Arabic word ""lillah"" (""for God"") inscribed in the Kufic script on its domed surface. The amulet was discovered in contexts dating to the 8th-9th centuries CE,  making it one of the oldest Islamic artifacts discovered thus far that far south along the East African coast. The word inscribed on its surface is the oldest piece of writing thus far recovered from Zanzibar, predating the Kizimkazi Mosque inscription by a a few centuries. This amulet seal was likely set in jewelry worn on one's person, as indicated by the faint discoloration visible on the flat surface of the amulet. Examination with Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) revealed that the inscription was made with a rotary tool. At some later point, a diagonal spall was removed across the inscription. At first, the spall was assumed to have been removed on purpose, reflecting a deliberate defacing of the inscription. However, upon SEM examination of the spall, it was revealed to have detached along a natural crystal plane in the rock crystal. Thus, it is impossible to say whether the spall was removed on purpose or not, but it is possible that the eventual defacement of the inscription by the spall led to the discard of the amulet seal by its original users. This artifact is classed as an ""amulet seal"" because it belongs to a class of Islamic amulets with inscriptions written backward, just as one would on a stamp/cylinder seal. It is unlikely that this object was used as a seal because the inscription is so shallow. Rather, the inscription written backwards on this artifact could reflect a desire to preserve the magic of the amulet. Islamic amulets often display inscription written backwards. The writing on Islamic amulets usually mentions the name of God (Allah) or the name of the user, and many times is written backward or is composed of strings of letters that do not form words. The rock crystal material of the Unguja Ukuu amulet seal is in keeping with a class of Islamic amulet seals that were associated with rain-making magic. Rock crystal is associated in Islam with the waters of heaven, and thus forms an important material from which amulets and other religious objects are made. The source of the rock crystal used to make the amulet remains unknown as rock crystal cannot be traced chemically. The discovery of this amulet in what was an ancient garbage dump or midden remains inexplicable, as such sacred objects are often deposited in ritually important spaces, like mosque courtyards or cemeteries. Its discovery in a midden could indicate that it was lost unintentionally by its user.",700,900,2165,1375,Akshay Sarathi,55,Julian Weideman,2023-12-19 21:10:30.760 +0100,2023-12-19 21:10:30.760 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),1.1566194132941026e-05,0.04823464501674903,3.915087721829286e-15,0.024314994566629777,0.0013906369500424481,1.4102099349190877e-12,5.062293243305799e-06,0.834907626491756,0.09113546848603242

Beginning late in 1905 in French Niger at Kobkitanda, the uprising quickly expanded to Satiru in British northern Nigeria at the beginning of 1906. Disgruntled peasants, runaway slaves, and radical clerics who opposed both the colonial administrations and indigenous authorities made up the Mahdist supporters of the uprising. The 'ulama, affluent businessmen, and nobility were not known to be in favor. Strong class and, consequently, racial divisions were thus mirrored in the uprising.

2076,Kizimkazi Dimbani Mosque Inscription,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The mosque at Kizimkazi Dimbani, located on the southern coast of the island of Unguja (Zanzibar) is important because it boasts an inscription that dates to 1107CE and is one of the earliest extant mosques on the Swahili coast. The inscription is  located on the northern wall of the mosque and runs into the mihrab. It reads as follows: ""This is what has ordered the high and very great Shaikh es-Saiyid Abu 'Imran Musa, son of al Hasan, son of Muhammad . . .âmay Allah grant him long life and destroy his enemiesâabout building this mosque on a Sunday of the month Dhu-lqa'da in the year five hundred (A.D. 1107)."" To the right of the mihrab is a quote from the Quran (ch. ix, 18). The alcove of the mihrab is inscribed with verses 80-82 of ch. xvii of the Quran. Two rosettes are placed above the mihrab. The rosette on the right contains verse 24 of ch. xiii of the Quran, while the rosette on the left has not been fully deciphered. A later inscription (placed atop an erased portion of the original inscription) says that the mosque was rebuilt in 1770 CE.

This inscription is important not only because it is evidence for the early presence of Islam on Zanzibar (1107CE), but also because it is written in the floriate and plaited Kufic script. This suggests that a foreign craftsperson/calligrapher was involved in the placing of this dedicatory inscription in the mosque. The construction of the mosque itself has been linked to immigrant Near Eastern populations rather than as a product of local construction. However, like at the Swahili ""stone towns"", the mosque is built of limestone and plastered over with burnt limestone plaster. The entry on the Kizimkazi Mosque provides information on the mosque itself.",1107,2023,2169,1375,Akshay Sarathi,55,Julian Weideman,2023-12-22 22:13:29.587 +0100,2023-12-26 21:30:14.360 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.0004954703749509443,0.047312697424274325,3.210732126882394e-15,0.05724185167742613,0.011300015015718451,0.26626907430332497,8.644123966655157e-05,0.5852194916508827,0.03207495831375252

2080,Daily Communal Petitions (Tefillah/Amidah),52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Tefillah (âthe Prayer"") or Amidah (âstanding [prayer]"") is a communal prayer of rabbinic Judaism, established by the Mishnah for each service, morning, afternoon, and evening (and an additional service on festive days). It consists of praise, petition, and thanksgiving to God. With a quorum, the prayer is recited by each individual participant and then repeated by a designated prayer leader (except in the evening). The Tefillah is divided into three sections â praise of the divine upon entering into God's presence (3 paragraphs); on weekdays, petitions for particular human needs (12/13 paragraphs), replaced by a single non-petitionary paragraph about the day on Sabbaths and holy days; and thanksgiving when concluding interaction with the divine (3 paragraphs) â with each paragraph of the prayer ending with âblessed are you, O LORDâ followed by a name of God or a divine role. While the weekday Tefillah consists of 18 paragraphs in the version from the Land of Israel in late antiquity, the Babylonian tradition lengthens it to 19.  Thematic expansions are also made to the service on occasions such as minor festivals, fast days, or the New Year. The language of the Tefillah was heavily influenced by the Bible. Its thematic structure and some language were fixed by the third and fourth centuries CE â with variations increasingly less tolerated over the centuries. There is evidence that the Tefillah/Amidah was being used in rabbinic circles as early as the late first century, but transmission was oral. Full prayer books emerge only in the late 9th c. (Seder Rav Amram Gaon); better manuscripts exist for the Siddur Rav Saadia Gaon (c. 925).",50,1000,2282,1539,Ruth Langer,58,Jennifer Singletary,2023-12-23 22:48:41.150 +0100,2024-02-28 20:03:37.101 +0100,Prayer in the Ancient World,0.008312696759609923,0.25324588573465073,3.791162647397565e-15,0.3204097578692452,0.003905030370266177,0.3437816198171392,0.0017369950549737483,0.06860792161148206,9.278262918317761e-08
2081,Ben Sira 36:1â22,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"This text is a selection from the book of Ben Sira, a collection of proverbs and teachings written by a Jewish sage in Hebrew in the 2nd century BCE and later translated into Greek (likely in Alexandria) by an author claiming to be his grandson. Ben Sira participates in the Near Eastern tradition of wisdom literature, drawing its most direct inspiration from the book of Proverbs. Over time, Ben Sira became familiar within the rabbinic Jewish community â it is cited by the Talmud on multiple occasions â and has been included in some versions of the Christian Bible as either âSirachâ or âEcclesiasticusâ (its Latin name). Though the Book of Ben Sira was not canonized within the Jewish tradition, there are resonances to the text in Jewish literature in the late antique and medieval periods. The oldest preserved versions of Ben Sira are in Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and Syriac. Though they bear the same message, some slight differences exist in the translations. Six medieval manuscripts were found in the Cairo Genizah in 1896, and more fragmentary ancient copies dating to 50-70 BCE were found at the Dead Sea. This selection is a prayer of petition to God to deliver Israel and bring misfortune to its enemies. It is written in poetic form and interweaves praise of the nature and power of God with petitions for his aid for the Jewish people.",-200,100,2267,1539,Benjamin Wright,58,Jennifer Singletary,2023-12-23 22:54:04.465 +0100,2024-03-06 21:48:03.165 +0100,Prayer in the Ancient World,0.008312696759609923,0.25324588573465073,3.791162647397565e-15,0.3204097578692452,0.003905030370266177,0.3437816198171392,0.0017369950549737483,0.06860792161148206,9.278262918317761e-08

2094,Feathered Serpent's cult,43,Religious Group (v6),"The choice of the name ""Feathered Serpent"" is due to the fact that there are translations for most of the Indigenous peoples who have lived in present-day Mexico and the United States of America. While the Nahuatl name ""Quetzalcoatl"" is probably the most well-known by most readers, it is a Late Postclassic and colonial Nahuatl term used mostly in the Highlands of Mexico. In fact, the names ""Kukulkan"" in Maya Tzeltal, ""QÊ¼uqÊ¼umatz"" in Q'iche' are local versions of the Feathered Serpent.

This onomastic diversity is accompanied by epithets that denote positive and negative attributes, powers, and domains. Speaking of the positive ones, he's considered as creator of humanity, provider of fire and food, patron of artists, announcer of rains, organizer of time and stars, young conquering warrior, priest concerned with rules, etc. About the negative ones, he is the first to sacrifice the gods, claims for human sacrifices. It then becomes Naxcit, Hun Ac El, Kan Tepeu, Nanahuatl, Ce Acatl, EhÃ©catl, etc. Its own name is the perfect of complementary opposites: the quetzal feathers remind us its heavenly nature, and the coatl or serpent refers to its chthonian aspect.

Despite the cultural, linguistic, and figurative diversity inherent in the Mesoamerican religious Tradition, this entry highlights shared aspects of the Feathered Serpent cult in ancient Mesoamerica, taking into account colonial texts written in Spanish or Nahuatl, pre-Hispanic depictions, and some ethnographic testimonies.",100,1521,2182,1201,Bertrand Lobjois,54,Diana Moreiras,2023-12-27 23:46:36.285 +0100,2024-01-15 19:46:33.227 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.00743558111949807,0.019689966380139166,3.642329355723709e-15,1.9255254077432764e-09,3.7364974225591e-16,0.00046172328451903066,0.9724127272903144,1.0994122599599301e-20,9.634263141256244e-31

2111,Tsinburbura Traditional Religion,43,Religious Group (v6),"Tsinbur-bura was a  traditional religion of the settlers of the ancient locality of the Kano region of Northern Nigeria, who were believed to have migrated from the Gaya environment to reside around the Dala Hill in search of Iron ore for blacksmithing purposes. The people held on to the religious practice as early as the 7th century under the guidance of Barbushe (the chief priest) to worship a deity of Tsinbur-Bura. The worship focused on consistent obedience to its directives and offering Animal sacrifices to please its spirit, which in turn guaranteed the success and safety of the people in all their endeavors. The practice was sustained long before the arrival of Islam in the early 13th century, which exterminated the practice and turned the shrine into a tourism hill of Dala and Goron Dutse.",700,1463,1673,1472,Bilyaminu Muhammad,43,Quinn Clark,2024-01-08 21:30:51.834 +0100,2024-01-14 14:02:00.825 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),3.453339869934429e-05,0.0004151593813311086,9.043631083711391e-14,3.295062260873764e-13,0.9993730637125616,2.541039693682083e-13,0.00017724350673373006,2.418864000212445e-25,1.9655775293454198e-16
2112,Mengzi,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"Mengzi å­å­, also known as Mencius or Meng-tzu, was a Chinese philosopher who lived during the Warring States period of Chinese history (around 372â289 BCE). He is considered one of the most important Confucian philosophers and is often referred to as the âSecond Sageâ after Confucius himself. The collection of dialogues and essays attributed to him, called Mengzi, is an essential part of the Confucian canon, along with the Analects of Confucius.

Mengzi is best known for his assertion of the innate goodness of human nature. He argued that everyone possesses natural tendencies toward goodness and that hostile external circumstances can lead people astray. Mengzi developed the idea of the Four âBeginningsâ or âSproutsâ as innate dispositions towards goodness in humans: benevolence (ä» ren), righteousness (ç¾© yi), ritual propriety (ç¦® li), and wisdom (æº zhi). These dispositions are present in everyone and can be nurtured to reach their full virtue.

Mengzi also emphasized the importance of benevolent governance. A ruler who fails to govern justly could be overthrown, as the mandate to rule was contingent on virtuous rule. He believed that individuals should cultivate their innate moral dispositions through reflection. Finally, Mengzi engaged in philosophical debates with thinkers such as Yangzhu and Mozi, who held contrasting views on human nature and the Way (édao), defending Confucianism against these rival schools of thought.",-323,-314,467,1548,Lok Chui Choo,45,Matthew Hamm,2024-01-09 22:40:14.739 +0100,2024-03-19 09:30:30.353 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.5794560557886642,2.672667363041802e-12,5.959515893947171e-14,0.14375084253332385,0.0014710096882920153,0.027339677514981106,0.20211726829751953,0.040084856978426286,0.005780289196060775

This entry focuses on the hymns known as Amram Dare #6 and Amram Dare #25. The former is a short, lyrical, unrhymed hymn consisting of 33 stichs that emphasizes the uniqueness of God and Moses, while the latter is longer and more structured, consisting of 22 strophes with an embedded acrostic. The second hymn focuses on God's work as creator. Though the ritual occasion for their use in Late Antiquity is not precisely known, in contemporary Samaritan practice the first hymn is recited on Wednesday, the 4th Sabbath of the month, on festivals, and during the week of Shavuot.

2128,Paulicians,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Paulicians were a heterodox Christian group which emerged on the eastern frontiers of Byzantine Anatolia and in Armenia in the seventh century, apparently founded by a certain Armenian, Constantine of Samosata, who took the name Silvanus after one of the apostles of Paul, and who, according to legend, converted the official sent to try and execute him for heresy, with this man becoming his successor under the name of Titus, who would himself be executed by burning under Justinian II Rhinometos. Following the immolation  of their second leader, and fearing further persecution, the sect fled in a mass exodus to a certain region on the Eastern frontier known as Episparis, and thence to another adjacent region called Mananalis following the trial and acquittal of their leader Gegnaesius for heresy under the auspices of Leo I for fear of further interventions and potential persecution on the part of the Roman state; nevertheless, the emperor Constantine V effected the forced migration of numerous Paulicians to Thrace to strengthen the Thracian frontier, which would be the first of many forced and imperially mandated migrations from Anatolia to the Balkans. The death of Gegnaesius occasioned a  schism in the church between the party of Baanes and that of Sergius, with the Sergites gaining the ascendancy apparently proselytizing widely in the eastern provinces, and inviting renewed persecutions under Leo the Armenian. Under Theodora, a still more intense persecution began, which eventually led to the flight of many Paulicians under their leader Karbeas across the border into the districts of Armenia under Islamic rule, where the Emir of Melitene allowed them to construct the fortress city of Tephrike, which acted as a redoubt and buffer state with Byzantium under Arab protection. Nevertheless, in the late 9th century, Basil I conquered these principalities after prolonged wars with a particularly bellicose leader known as Chrysocheir, and while part of the population retreated further into Armenia, merging, evidently, into the emerging Tondrakian movement, much of the rest was deported to the Thracian provinces by he and his immediate successors, where they continued to exist as a distinct ethnoreligious group, renowned as hill raiders and warriors, and concentrated especially in the vicinity of Philippopolis, where they evidently evangelized the local population to their creed. They are believed to be the ancestors of modern day Banat Bulgarians who converted to Catholicism in the 16th and 17th Centuries, as well as of the Muslim Pomaks. It is also possible they had some influence on the Bogomiil sect and on that of the Cathars, though this may be a mistaken connection. The basic doctrines of the sect are very much a subject of debate, whether they were dualistic, gnostic, adoptionist, or simply a reformist movement unrelated to these designations. Their Christology seems to have been nontrinitarian, and according to the (admittedly biased) accounts of their belief attributed to the pen of to Petros Sikeliotes, they accepted the New Testament though not the Tanakh, and evidently had iconoclastic tendencies and worshipped in simple meetinghouses, though the account may represent a spurious source. Anna Komnene refers to them as Manichaeans in her Alexiad, but this seems to be more an imputation of potential dualism or perhaps a generic term of disparagement rather than any indication that they actually followed the doctrines of Mani. Based on their apparent rejection of imperial ecclesiastical and secular hierarchies, they are sometimes considered an egalitarian or proto-Marxist movement, or, conversely, a proto-protestant one, though such arguments are spurious at best.",650,1700,1893,1320,Ethan Schmidt,49,Ian Randall,2024-01-21 23:00:15.816 +0100,2024-01-29 06:17:04.042 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.0013156235018534407,0.039835782026200243,5.8703501184599104e-15,0.14022749499069018,0.004897848097164055,0.6702149977950694,0.00022708015924108687,0.1432811148821556,5.854762030345511e-08
2131,ChimÃº Empire Religion,43,Religious Group (v6),"The ChimÃº empire developed on the North Coast of Peru between ca. 900 and 1470 CE and its peak it was one of the largest Prehispanic polities in the Americas. The 1604 Anonymous History of Trujillo includes a mythical account of ChimÃº origins (Rowe 1948). A foreign noble called Taycanamo arrived in the Moche Valley, disembarking from a balsa log raft, claiming to be sent by a great lord from across the sea. He spent a year to learn local customs and traditions. He was given local women for wives and became Chimu' ruler (Chimor Capac), establishing a dynasty. Chan Chan, the capital of the empire, was located in the Moche Valley and it was the largest urban center of its time, covering about 20km2 (urban core 6 km2) and hosting 30,000-40,000 people. In an alternative origin myth recorded by Percy Valladares Huamanchumo (2021), the city may have been founded by a man who was born from an egg laid by the Moon in the GuaÃ±ape islands. The man was raised by people living in the fishing village of Huanchaco. Eventually, he became their leader and funded Chan Chan. Chan Chan featured a variety of buildings made with sunbaked adobe bricks or tapia (rammed earth) walls, including walled royal compounds (ciudadelas), elite compounds, ceremonial platforms (huacas), and residential areas for commoners/artisans. As shown by these architectural compounds and by creation myths, people were subdivided into well-defined, and perhaps immutable, social classes. A myth mentioned by Antonio de la Calancha says that coastal people were created by four stars: two stars created kings and nobles, while the other two stars created commoners. Another myth recorded by the same author described the creation of social classes from three eggs. Royal and noble males spawned from a golden egg, noble women from a silver egg, and commoners from a copper egg (Calancha 1638; Mackey and Moore 2008; Moseley and Cordy-Collins 1990: Rowe 1948). 

By 1200 CE, the ChimÃº empire consolidated its power in its heartland, which was composed of the Moche, Chicama, and VirÃº valleys. The 14th century was marked by a significant expansion of the empire: in that century, the ChimÃº expanded northward, conquering the lands controlled by the Lambayeque/SicÃ¡n polity (the area comprised between the Lambayeque and the Chira valleys), and southward, defeating the Casma polity and occupying its territory (between Chao and Casma valleys). The empire may have also exerted its influence further north to Tumbes and south to the ChillÃ³n valley through trade. At its peak, the ChimÃº empire featured a four-tiered settlement hierarchy, with the capital Chan Chan at the top, followed by the regional centers of FarfÃ¡n, TÃºcume, and Manchan, and tertiary and quaternary centers scattered throughout the empire. The ChimÃº dominance over the North Coast of Peru came to an end around 1470 CE, when the Inka defeated them and incorporated this part of the Central Andes into their empire. 

Excavations carried out at ChimÃº settlements and ethnohistorical sources help us shed light on the religious practices of the people that occupied the North Coast of Peru during the Late Intermediate Period (ca. 900/1000-1470 CE).",900,1470,2199,1198,Amedeo Sghinolfi,54,Diana Moreiras,2024-01-23 15:24:25.814 +0100,2024-03-25 18:12:51.373 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.005110503534043498,0.0897764433204101,0.27268686105857715,0.16383401483130258,0.0010543655228892773,1.790018543823403e-13,0.2753727150544414,0.07035403856858188,0.12181105810957528

The Movement was introduced in Lagos in 1916 and became popular among young intellectuals. Consequently it split in the 1930s over the issue of foreign control. A Nigerian branch of the Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam took shape under the leadership of Alhaji Jibril Martin, a leader of the Nigerian Youth Movement. By the 1950s there were three separate sections of the Ahmadiyya Movement in Lagos. Martin was also a cofounder and chairman of the Pilgrimsâ Board of Nigeriaâs western region, which administered the hajj pilgrimage following independence.
The Ahmadiyya Movement began establishing centers in the north in the 1960s, which was resisted among local Muslim leaders, including Abubakar Gumi, an Islamic legal scholar and future leader of the Islamist Yan Izala movement. Gumi translated several anti-Ahmadiyya works, including those by Pakistani Islamist Abul A'la al-Mawdudi, and supported the decision of the Islamic World League condemning the Ahmadiyya as heretical. In 1973, Saudi Arabia forbade Ahmadi Muslims from acquiring hajj visas, leading to violent protests in Nigeria during which Ahmadis occupied the Saudi embassy in Lagos. In 1974, the Nigerian Supreme Council of Islamic Affairs and the Jamaâatu Nasril Islam adopted the Leagueâs resolution, requiring that Muslims seeking a hajj visa acquire a written certificate from a local imam affirming that he or she was not a member of the Ahmadiyya Movement. As a result, the Ahmadiyya Movement split again, one dissenting group adopting the named Anwar al-Islam (âRays of Islamâ) and aligning itself with mainstream Sunni Islam. 

Nayyar's stay in Lagos coincided with the establishment of additional branches in Ebutte-Meta and Epe. Movement activities commenced in Yaba in 1921, and within two years, members had established missions in Ibadan, Kano and Zaria.[6] Expansion into Ado-Odo, Otta, Ijede and Ondo was completed by the mid 1930s .",1916,2024,1082,1304,Jabir  Musa,55,Julian Weideman,2024-01-25 11:41:38.267 +0100,2024-01-25 11:41:38.267 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),1.3254807314077113e-17,5.5542112116298085e-15,0.02051006683365221,1.2977163468558322e-13,0.9794884018391725,4.442015211781683e-24,2.3784178384692495e-07,6.834241959789523e-24,1.293485256165734e-06

2140,"St. John Chrysostom, Homilies On the Incomprehensible Nature of God",52,Religious Text (v1.0),"An important place among John's discourses are the five sermons on God's incomprehensibility. They form a unity, which the editors have incorporated into a series of discourses which Chrysostom delivered against the Anomeans. The Anomoeans was a religious group that represented an extreme form of Arianism. Arius and his followers believed that the essential difference between God and Christ was that God had always existed, while Christ was created by God. The Anomeans distorted the Nicene Creed formulation that the âSon of God, the only begotten of the Fatherâ meant that the Father is believed to be unbegotten and the Son being begotten made God. Therefore, the Father and the Son are unalike (Î±Î½ÏÎ¼Î¿Î¹Î¿Î¹). The founder of the Anomoeans, AÃ«tius of Antioch, held that God and Christ could not be alike. Since ingenerateness is a crucial part of the essence of God, Christ could not be like God because he lacked this essential quality. Another principal belief of the Anomeans was the ingenerateness (á¼Î³ÎµÎ½Î½Î·ÏÎ¯Î±) of God the Father. Being ingenerated, the Father could never come into contact or communicate His nature to generated beings. Therefore, the Son is generated (Î³ÎµÎ½Î½Î·ÏÏÏ), created by the power of the Ingenerated Father. The homilies Against the Anomoeans (twelve in number) fall into two series both in theme as well as in time and place. The setting was unique: not only were the Anomoeans present among his flock to listen to John, but they had even challenged him. This was a fine opportunity both to refute the errors of the Anomeans and to instruct his creed in the tenets of the true faith. Chrysostom, hence, could work for the conversion of the Anomoeans, and, at the same time, he could protect his own flock. The first five sermons were delivered in Antioch, in the autumn of 386, that is, the year in which Chrysostom had been ordained as a presbyter. The first sermon was delivered presumably at the end of August, while the rest during November and December of the same year. Although the theme of the sermons is strictly doctrinal, there is a number of moral exhortations, so dear to Chrysostom. For this reason, John also introduces the issue of prayer in these five sermons, particularly towards the end of each speech. In these five sermons Chrysostom mainly deals with a key point of the Anomean teaching, as posited by Eunomius: the epistemological problem. Following Aristotle, the Eunomius and his followers admitted that the human intellectual capacity is unlimited and able to conceive both the nature of the world and the actions of God. Thus, what God knows about himself, can be also known by humans. The Orthodox theologians, hence, diagnosed two tendencies in the Anomean teaching, which give rise to two problems: 
1) the tendency to declare man epistemologically self-sufficient, since he is able to grasp with his intellect everything, therefore he does not need God;
2) the tendency to diminish the greatness of God, since they persist in the abusive attempt to make God an object of curiosity and intellectual inquiry, as an object accessible to the human intellect. 
So, according to Chrysostom, God is transcendent and inconceivable. As the sole principle, cause and source of all beings and all goods, God acts through and with his Word (Logos). It is therefore impossible for human beings to conceive the inconceivable God. Being finite with limited intellectual capabilities and moving within the epistemological limits that God has provided to, human beings cannot reach the full understanding of the divine mystery. However, Chrysostom does not promote agnosticism. On the contrary, God gave man the possibility of partial knowledge. This is a natural result of His goodness, that is, that he descends into the world and allows himself to be known. God reveals Himself, but what He reveals is not His essence, but His divine energies. For this reason, the human intellect can never comprehend Godâs essence, but only His will and His energies. Such revelation comes through faith. It does not need logical constructions, only auxiliary, interpretive ones. Regarding the following seven sermons, the 6th sermon is a break in the sequence of Chrysostom's attack against the Anomoeans. John has proved that God's nature is incomprehensible to every creature and has introduced the second part of his argument, the ""glory of the only begotten,"" the con substantiality of the Son with the Father. Therefore, the theme in sermons 7-12 that the Son is one in substance with the Father. So, in the remaining sermons Chrysostom sets to complete his discussion of the Son's co-substantiality. Hence, sermons 7 and 8 have the same theme with sermons 9 and 10, since they all stress the glory of the only begotten and His equality in power with the Father. So the twelve homilies against the Anomoeans treat of two themes, the incomprehensibility of God (sermons 1-5) and the consubstantiality of Christ with the Father (sermons 7-12); they fall into two series separated by time and place: sermons 1-5 were delivered at Antioch in the years 386-87; sermons 11 and 12 belong to 398 and were preached in Constantinople.",347,407,2205,1170,Lampros Alexopoulos,49,Ian Randall,2024-01-27 10:22:07.957 +0100,2024-02-02 09:39:28.281 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),5.2073936144695885e-06,0.0013378467967704584,0.009762808654830696,0.08337257447417677,0.0004019989021944078,2.9743155868215924e-24,5.715230709981787e-06,2.9400374383508883e-12,0.9051138485447633
2143,City of God,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"City of God is one of the last works written by Augustine of Hippo (554-430 CE), a Christian bishop, philosopher, theologian, and Church Father from Hippo Regius in Roman North Africa. Many of the ideas put forth in this work remain essential Church doctrines. These include the doctrine of original sin, the conflict between divine omniscience and free will, and explanations for the existence of evil. 
Augustine wrote City of God as a response to those non-Christian Romans who argued that the sack of Rome by the Visigoths in 410 CE and the general decline of Rome was the fault of Christians. Roman religion required sacrifices to various gods in order to gain their favor and protection resulting in good conditions for the Roman Empire. Many thus argued that Christianity's adoption by Rome since the reign of Constantine (272-337 CE) had caused neglect of duties to Roman gods, resulting in Rome's deterioration.
Augustine first asserted that it was Christianity that was responsible for Rome's earlier successes. Furthermore, he argued that Rome's decline was ultimately unimportant compared with the goal of heaven, which he called the City of God (distinguished from Rome as the CIty of Human Beings). 
City of God examines human history as the conflict between these two cities which is the conflict between God and Satan, arguing that God is bound to win because history is and has always been divinely guided.",410,426,2299,1128,Joshua Schachterle,49,Ian Randall,2024-01-28 18:48:46.842 +0100,2024-03-07 09:55:10.232 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.19046900952970647,0.08469544979755729,0.07599296679502324,0.1286926594757364,0.02289739360050501,0.13431172791540893,0.18540555594718813,0.11818788305113635,0.05934735388773817

2149,Judaism in Byzantium,43,Religious Group (v6),"Jews constituted a significant minority group with the Byzantine Empire for the entirety of its history, and were, to a degree, integrated into wider Roman society, yet occupying something of a liminal position. Their legal status was defined and circumscribed in Late Antiquity by successive legislations, with them being guaranteed a degree of protection from arbitrary molestation and right to practice their religion freely, while also being legally and socially subordinated to the Christian majority. For example, the Theodosian code barred their participation in civil or military officialdom, while the Justinianic code attempted to subordinate the administration of the Jewish community to that of the Roman State, further circumscribing the rights of Jews and, most strikingly, banning the public reading of the Pentateuch in Hebrew rather than Greek, and totally proscribing the reading of the Mishna. Herakleios, faced with a combination of internal crisis and Jewish support of Sassanian and later Arab occupations of Syria and Egypt, attempted a massive forced conversion of Jews and heretics within the empire, though this was apparently unsuccessful, as the continued existence of vigorous Jewish communities within Byzantium attest, and the years between the reign of Herakleios and the Fourth Crusade would be punctuated by only brief and limited persecutions under Leo III the Isaurian, Basil I the Macedonian, and Ioannes Tzimiskes. Despite their potentially precarious social and legal position, the Jewish communities of Byzantium flourished; Justinian's prohibition on the reading of the Mishna conversely led to the composition of elaborate liturgical poems known as piyutim, which were influential in later traditions of the Mahzor, while scholars in a Jewish Community in the Byzantine Catepanate of Italy composed the famous chronicle of the Sefer Yosippon. Benjamin of Tudela's notes on his travels through Byzantium in the twelfth century during the reign of Manuel I Komnenos reveal a world in which, despite both institutionalized and informal systems of antisemitic segregation and discrimination, Jewish communities flourished economically, taking part in agriculture, medicine, trade, and the especially the production of luxury textiles. Though partially segregated from broader society by the boundaries of their designated quarters and internal communal institutions, Jewish communities were a conspicuous presence in the larger cities of the Byzantine world such as Thebes, Corinth, Thessalonike, Rhodes, and above all in Pera-Galata opposite Constantinople, which, before it became a Genoese colony, was an extramural settlement of Jews and tanners. The depredations visited upon the Empire by Latin Crusaders and seaborne marauders that would culminate in the Fourth Crusade effected Byzantine Jews as it did their Christian neighbors (or, indeed, perhaps more so), and the impoverished successor states which emerged from those crises proved more able and more willing to persecute Jews than their predecessors, as bouts of persecution in the Despotate of Epiros under Theodore Komnenos Doukas, and in the Empire of Nikaia under Ioannes Vatatzes and his son Theodoros II Laskaris demonstrate. Nevertheless, the ascension of the Palaiologoi at least temporarily reversed this pattern, for Michael VIII relied on the funds of the Jewish community in his bid for emperor and, as such, extended to them certain freedoms and protections which were preserved by his son and successor Andronikos II, attracting censure from the Melkite Patriarch of Alexandria. Ultimately, the Jewish communities which proved the sites of the most anxiety for the Palaiologoi would be those of Venetian Jews or Jews of naturalized Venetian citizenship, who thus came under the purview of the economic and legal concessions granted to La Serenissima. The conquest of Byzantium by the Ottomans, however, incorporated Byzantine, or Romaniote, Jews into a far broader patchwork of communities in Europe and the Middle East, and led to the settlement in the Aegean of numerous Sephardic refugees fleeing from the kingdoms of Iberia, which would alter the Jewish demography of the region. Nevertheless, Romaniote congregations continue to exist in Greece, Israel, and the United States to this day.",330,1453,1893,1320,Ethan Schmidt,49,Ian Randall,2024-01-29 16:09:16.212 +0100,2024-02-22 19:00:42.575 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.0528972029772975,1.8469321337967456e-12,9.54809876207735e-15,0.1917803819261355,0.005088748616640078,0.6535065437882052,0.0002170617054182536,0.0965100108291006,5.01553464668646e-08

Basically, Lu Xiujingâs catalogue divided the Lingbao canon into two sections: the Old Lingbao scriptures (jiu jing èç¶) instructed by the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Commencement (Yuanshi Tianzunåå§å¤©å°) and the newly revealed scriptures (xin jing æ°ç¶) instructed by Xu Laile, the Perfected of Most Utmost (Taiji Zhenren Xu Laile å¤ªæ¥µçäººå¾ä¾å). The Old Lingbao scriptures start with two essential scriptures: the first one is Scripture of Celestial Writing, Perfect Script in Jade (or Five) Tablets, Written in Red by Five Elders of Primordial Commencementåå§äºèèµ¤æ¸çï¼äºï¼ç¯çæå¤©æ¸ç¶ that introduce the emergence of celestial scripts; the second one is Wondrous Scripture of Jade Instruction Written in Red by Numinous Treasure, Cavern Mystery of Most High å¤ªä¸æ´çéå¯¶èµ¤æ¸çè¨£å¦ç¶ that is read as commentary for the celestial scripts. Therefore, these two scriptures which are preserved in the in the Daoist Canon of Zhengtong (Zhengtong daozang æ­£ç»éè) of the Ming are closely related to each other. 
The first scripture demonstrates the Daoist concept of genesis and celestial provenance starting from the emergence of the Perfect Scripts which symbolizes the openness of the new Kalpa cycle. The Perfected Scripts were regarded as the supreme and most powerful force in the Daoist cosmogeny, but they were invisible and intangible to humans. Then the Perfected Scripts were materialized by the highest deity Celestial Worthy of Primordial Commencement (Yuanshi Tianzun åå§å¤©å°). Then he transmitted them to other celestial beings. The materialized Perfected Scripts were still unintelligible to humans. So, the celestial beings took the responsibility to translate the Perfected Scripts into the form of the human language which are in total thirty-six juan scriptures and two juan oral instructions These scriptures were called Old Lingbao Scriptures that were categorized into ten sections. The scripture contains the images of Cloudy seals of the Perfect Script and the Five Directional Talismans, followed by the instructions for use of the talismans.
The second scripture Jade Instructions is regarded, to some degree, as the commentary of the first one. It introduces how the Lingbao scriptures, which are translation and interpretation of the Perfected Scripts done by the Most High Lord of Great Dao å¤ªä¸å¤§éå (abbr. the Lord Dao éå or the Dao é) and other celestial beings, were transmitted to the human world at the end of the Five Kalpa Cycles. The two humans who received the Lingbao scriptures from the Lord Dao were Wang Longci çé¾è³ and A Qiuzeng é¿ä¸æ¾. This scripture also provides the methods and rituals on how to use the Instruction of Five Directions to eliminate crimes and disasters.
Scholars have noticed a great number of terms and concepts in the Lingbao scriptures that were adapted from Buddhist scriptures. However, the meanings and the connotations of these terms were changed and became distinct from those in the Buddhist context in order to serve the Daoist purposes, or to solve the newly emerged challenges that Daoist were encountering.",500,1000,2281,1464,Liying Xu,45,Matthew Hamm,2024-01-31 19:10:28.422 +0100,2024-02-28 19:56:08.643 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),8.686328348227869e-14,7.361000906762585e-13,1.1826503118022506e-13,0.9827667660765015,0.00014224543932806833,0.003942743319293513,0.013148218326436365,1.1711912519174468e-13,2.6837382400812818e-08
2157,Blue Light Evangelicals in the Late Eighteenth-Century Royal Navy,43,Religious Group (v6),"Rear Admiral Richard Kempenfelt and Comptroller of the Navy Charles Middleton are credited for spearheading the Blue Light Movement within the Royal Navy. This was a Methodist campaign that sought to restore ritualized religious adherence among sailors aboard ship throughout the American, French, and Napoleonic Wars. This aquatic sub-revival is closely affiliated with the Navy, but merchantmen also witnessed this movement below deck. Navy officers with Methodist leanings were principally referred to as ""Blue Lights,"" and while these men were characteristically socially and politically conservative, they believed that the spiritual status-quo of the Royal Navy prior to the American Revolutionary War necessitated reform. The Blue Lights believed that the Navy was tainted by licentiousness, lethargy and moral decline due to a lack of competent religious leadership throughout the eighteenth-century and needed a spiritual reawakening. For these staunch Protestants, a primary aim for introducing evangelical Christianity into British maritime life was to group officers and common seamen together in a religious unity that transcended rank. Blue Lights perceived the ship as a fertile missional ground for evangelistic activity and paternal pastorship among the rank and file. As one ""church,"" officers and sailors gathered below deck in the crew's quarters to read the Bible, sing psalms, and pray in equitable brotherhood; a revolutionary idea in a traditional environment that structurally reinforced rank segregation. As a term, it is difficult to ascertain when ""Blue Light"" was first used. However, the nickname caught on by the end of the Napoleonic Wars in naval circles, with common sailors being referred to as Methodists or pslam-singers and officers as Blue Lights (sometimes also called psalm-singers).",1775,1815,2225,1560,Bethany Henderson,1,M.

2160,Manichaeans,43,Religious Group (v6),"Manichaeism was a dualistic religious movement that was founded in Persia in the 3rd century CE by Mani, who was known as the Apostle of Light or the supreme illuminator. Even though Manichaeism was broadly considered as a Christian heresy, which many Christian Fathers opposed with their writings, it was in fact a religion per se. The coherence of its doctrines and the rigidness of the structure and institutions, preserved throughout its history a unity and unique character. The founder of Manichaeism was Mani. He was of Iranian origin, born in 216 near Seleucia-Ctesiphon (southern Babylonia), in modern day Iraq, in the Parthian Empire. It is believed that his parents were members of the Jewish Christian Gnostic sect known as the Elcesaites, a sect active between 100 and 400 CE originating in the Transjordan region. Mani considered himself as the final successor in a long line of prophets, from Adam to Jesus Christ, also including Buddha and Zoroaster. His views on other, earlier religious systems was critical, since he believed that the effectiveness of religious experience, as well as the transcendental experiences were limited. He therefore regarded himself as the carrier of a universal message destined to replace any other religion. In his effort to prevent corruption and to ensure doctrinal unity, he recorded his teachings in writing and gave them canonical status during his lifetime. At the age of 24, after receiving a divine order that imposed him to publicly proclaim his doctrines, Mani began preaching throughout the Persian empire. Mani pursued to establish an ecumenical and universal religion that would integrate all the teachings of previously revealed truths, particularly those of Zoroaster, Buddha, and Jesus. However, beyond mere syncretism, it sought the proclamation of a truth that could be perceived in different forms. Manichaeism, therefore, resembles Iranian and Indian religions, as well as Christianity, Buddhism, and Taoism, depending on the context and in accordance with the different cultural background into which it spread. Maniâs missionary activity was unconstrained since he had the support of the Sasanian Empire. However, he failed to win the favor of the next generation of Persian royalty, the Emperor Bahram I, and with the disapproval of the Zoroastrian clergy Mani possibly died imprisoned (perhaps in 276-277) awaiting execution- his followers called that period the âPassion of the Illuminatorâ or Maniâs âcrucifixionâ. From its very first steps, the Manichaean church begun an active missionary activity to convert the world. Mani encouraged the translation of his writings into other languages and organized an extensive mission program. Manichaeism, hence, quickly spread west into the Roman Empire. From Egypt it moved across northern Africa, managing to convert figures such as the young Augustine, and even reached Rome in the early 4th century. It was during that century that the Manichaean expansion in the West reached its peak, establishing churches in southern Gaul and Spain, while it has also spread to the eastern provinces of the Persian Sasanian empire. The expansion of the Manichaeans to the East had already begun in the 7th century, after Chinaâs conquest of East Turkistan. A Manichaean missionary reached the Chinese court in 694, and in 732 an edict gave the religion freedom of worship in China. When East Turkistan was conquered in the 8th century by the Uyghur Turks, one of their leaders adopted Manichaeism. Manichaeism thus remained the state religion of the Uyghur kingdom until its overthrow in 840. Manichaeism probably survived in East Turkistan until the Mongol invasion in the 13th century. In China it was forbidden in 843, but, although persecuted, it continued there at least until the 14th century. Beliefs similar to Manichaeism appeared during the Middle Ages in Europe in the so-called neo-Manichaean sects. Groups such as the Paulicians (Armenia, 7th century), the Bogomilists (Bulgaria, 10th century), and the Cathari or Albigensians (southern France, 12th century) bore strong resemblances to Manichaeism. Mani and the Manichaeans were fiercely attacked by both the Christian church and the Roman state. Several Church Fathers, such as Serapion of Thmuis, Titus of Bostra, Epiphanius of Salamis, Cyril of Jerusalem, Augustine, John the Grammarian wrote treatises against Manichaeism, while philosophers also, such as Alexander of Lycopolis and Simplicius, attacked their doctrines. Hence, Manichaeism disappeared almost entirely from western Europe by the end of the 5th century and from the Byzantine empire during the 6th century.",250,843,2228,1170,Lampros Alexopoulos,49,Ian Randall,2024-02-02 18:31:40.583 +0100,2024-02-05 16:04:55.981 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),3.3275800582850705e-07,0.003414073430435916,0.07967741968074188,0.9169081682078061,2.919377989774235e-12,3.1815406460471773e-23,5.0001730153951865e-17,1.0227699612848301e-14,5.9200805419031155e-09
2166,Judaism in Byzantium,43,Religious Group (v6),"Jewish communities lived throughout the Byzantine Empire, as demonstrated by both historical sources and by archaeological excavations. 

From an archaeological standpoint, one of the most thoroughly researched Jewish communities in Byzantium to date is the Jewish community at Sardis, where a synagogue has been excavated and restored. In addition, graffiti and finds from the Byzantine shops at Sardis provide information about the occupations of some members of the community.

Archaeological evidence also indicates a Byzantine Jewish presence at Anemurium, Ephesus, Hierapolis (Pamukkale), and Sardis during the early Byzantine period; outside of Anatolia, sites such as Stobi, Tell Beit Mirsim, and Jerusalem had Jewish communities while under Byzantine rule (Crawford, p. 154).

For the period from ca. 300-700 CE, the Jewish communities of the Byzantine Empire are most extensively studied through the archaeological record, significant recent historical works notwithstanding (see Kalmin, below). However, the period from 700 onward allows for a more detailed historical analysis, due to the greater survival of primary source texts, such as the travels of Benjamin of Tudela in the 12th century. From the twelfth century onward, Jewish communities throughout the Byzantine Empire (as well as formerly Byzantine lands) have been recorded across the western half of Anatolia, in the Aegean, as well as throughout the Balkan and Peloponnesian peninsulas (Bowman p. 51, 173).

Although Jews were typically allowed to exist as a legally recognized, autonomous groups within the Byzantine Empire, the Byzantine period also included periods of persecution and forced conversion. In 721-2, Leo III issued an edict which required baptism both for Jews and for Montanists. This led to some Jewish communities leaving the empire, while others converted, sometimes continuing to practice Judaism in secret (Starr p. 2). Emperor Basil II (r. 867-886) also enacted measures to convert the Byzantine Jews, first through persuasion, and later through compulsion (Starr p. 4).

Jews of the Byzantine Empire were typically referred to as ""Romaniotes"" (Benjamin of Tudela). The Byzantine Empire included both Karaite and Rabbanite communities.",395,1453,1893,1520,Sofia Kane,49,Ian Randall,2024-02-05 12:46:28.503 +0100,2024-02-22 13:39:08.561 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.0003036857640932551,0.026341806773536147,1.778897188823537e-15,0.033433137816339595,0.00013187420492354575,2.2090623598624163e-12,6.549260936274293e-05,0.9113341694201208,0.02838983340941306

2177,The Covenant Ceremony in the Community Rule (1QS),52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Covenant Ceremony is a section of the Community Rule (1QS 1:16â2:18), one of the Dead Sea Scrolls. It is an initiation ceremony for members joining the community and a reminder of group boundaries and beliefs for those who have previously joined the group. The ceremony itself consists of three parts: a description of the community which the initiates join (referred to as the order of the yahad) and a blessing of God; a description of Godâs deeds for Israel (led by the priests) and the sins of Israel (led by the Levites) to which the initiates respond with confession of their own sins and priests bless God's lot and the Levites curse Belial's lot; and a statement regarding the priests' and the Levitesâ cursing those who come to the covenant ceremony with impure or false motives. The initiates assent to the conclusion of each major section of the ceremony with a collective âAmen, amen.â There is no specific timing for the ritualâs performance described within the text, but textual references hint that it may have taken place during the festival of weeks, which is associated with covenant-making traditions. The ceremony pairs blessings and confessions to ensure that those who join the covenant with pure heart and mind receive the blessing and those who do not are cursed. Only those initiated into the community via the ceremony were able to access purification and atonement from their God. The best manuscript of the Covenant Ceremony is the Community Rule (S) 1QS 1:16-2:18, though fragments with parallel textual material have been found in other manuscripts (4Q256, 4Q257, and 5Q11). All texts of the Covenant Ceremony are written in Hebrew, and all but 4Q257 (which is written on papyrus) are leather scrolls. Extant manuscripts are dated to the first century BCE. There are no variants in the textual material across these manuscripts but the material is poorly preserved.

2178,Aladura Christianity in Nigeria,43,Religious Group (v6),"Aladura Christianity emerged in Nigeria in the early 20th century as a response to the perceived inadequacies of the Mainline Christian denominations in addressing the spiritual and physical needs of the people. The movement sought a return to what its founders believed were the authentic, spiritual roots of Christianity. Also, the emergence of this brand of Christianity could be said to be in reaction to a community in turmoil caused by hunger, the Great Depression, smallpox, and influenza outbreaks, which were some of the effects of the First World War. The term ""Aladura"" is a Yoruba word that translates to ""owners of prayer"" or ""people of prayer."" Aladura Christianity has played a significant role in the religious landscape of Nigeria. Key figures in the early history of the Aladura movement in Nigeria include Joseph Babalola of the Christ Apostolic Church (CAC), Moses Orimolade Tunolase and Christiana Abiodun Emanuel, prominent leaders associated with the Cherubim and Seraphim (C&S), Josiah Ositelu of the Church of the Lord - Aladura (CLA) and Samuel Bilewu Joseph Oschoffa of the Celestial Church of Christ (CCC).
Since its founding as prayer gatherings inside more established Nigerian churches, particularly the Church Missionary Society (CMS), the Aladura churches have attracted a sizable following. Early in the 20th century, the Aladura churches flourished, although along ethnic lines, especially among the Yoruba. Over the years, this brand of Christianity has enjoyed significant patronage from other tribes. Salvation, repentance, forgiveness, holiness, healing, deliverance, exorcism, spiritual baptism, spiritual gifts, and spiritual authority are the foundational elements of Aladura Christianity.
Aladura churches emphasise the importance of fervent prayer and spiritual warfare against forces of evil, and to retain the presence and power of the Holy Spirit. Members often engage in intense prayer sessions, deliverance services, and fasting. This movement places strong emphasis on divine healing and miracles through the power of the Holy Spirit. Healing services and the belief in the laying on of hands for healing are common practices. Their services are known for their vibrant and charismatic worship style, including lively music, dancing, and spontaneous expressions of faith. The movement embraces the charismatic and Pentecostal aspects of Christianity. Many Aladura churches have a strong prophetic ministry, where leaders and members believe in receiving and delivering messages from God through prophetic utterances. They often incorporate elements of indigenous African spirituality and cultural practices. The group's syncretic practices are evident in the use of indigenous languages, cultural symbols, and rituals.
Aladura churches are often involved in community development, social welfare, and philanthropic activities. They play a role in addressing social issues such as poverty, education, and healthcare in their communities. It must be noted that while Aladura Christianity has its roots in Nigeria, it has spread to other parts of the world. Churches affiliated with the Aladura movement can be found in various countries with Nigerian and African communities. This brand of Christianity has contributed significantly to the diversity of Christian expression in Nigeria and has influenced the broader Pentecostal and Charismatic movements within the country.",1918,2023,1082,1451,Oluwasegun Aluko,57,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,2024-02-12 10:46:30.872 +0100,2024-04-29 17:15:48.862 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.00020040501206472743,0.6234552615760055,1.400247555837724e-15,0.012441389495784579,2.2528075612930508e-12,0.363635491543286,0.0002672798099495645,1.7256065556378566e-07,1.373830030628863e-18
2180,Cao ÄÃ i,43,Religious Group (v6),"Cao ÄÃ i is a syncretic indigenous Vietnamese religion that was born out of the milieu of the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam and the borderlands of Vietnam and Cambodia. Although the religion is monotheistic, it also intentionally blends elements of Catholicism, Vietnamese folk traditions, Chinese religions (especially the sanjiao or tÃ¢m giÃ¡o, Daoism, Confucianism, and Chinese influenced/Chinese Buddhism), and more global understandings of revelation. For instance, the Prophet Muhammed is considered part of the ""Prophets of the Christian Era"" along with the Prophet Baab (Bahai'i), Moses (Judaism), and Jesus (Christianity). The religion was founded by NgÃ´ VÄn ChiÃªu, who was a Vietnamese administrator and district head in the French colony of Cochinchina. Officially, this new religion became name as the Äáº¡i Äáº¡o Tam Ká»³ Phá» Äá» (Great way of the Third Time of Redemption,"" indicating the perception that the early 20th century was to be a new era of revealed truth. Thus, it is not entirely surprising that modern historical figures, such as the French author Victor Hugo, the Chinese nationalist Sun Yat Sen, and Vietnamese national poet-saint, Nguyá»n Bá»nh KhiÃªm (1491-1585) were established as saints. During the First Indochina War, the Cao ÄÃ i movement formed their own militia, which was then subordinated to the Republic of Vietnam military (ARVN) during the Second Indochina War. Typically anti-communist during the Second Indochina War, Cao ÄÃ i militia members were treated with extra scrutiny during and after the subsequent reunification of Vietnam in 1976. Consequentially, substantial Cao ÄÃ i diasporas can be found in France, the United States, Canada and Australia. However, after normalization of relations between Vietnam and the United States in 1995, during a period of liberalization in the late 1990s, Cao ÄÃ i recognition in Vietnam was officially granted in 1997. Thus, after 1997, Cao ÄÃ i practice has been relatively unrestricted and formally recognized. In recent decades, splinter schools or offshoots of the officially recognized Cao ÄÃ i religion have complained about scolding and harassment from state sanctioned Cao ÄÃ i authorities. Such debates have emerged in a context where state-sanctioned religious sites, especially the main Cao ÄÃ i temple in TÃ¢y Ninh province--just north of Há» ChÃ­ Minh City, have become major sites for the international tourist community to visit.

2187,1 Samuel 2:1-10,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"1 Samuel 2:1-10 is an ancient Hebrew poem contained in the opening narrative of the Samuel-Saul-David narrative cycle in 1-2 Samuel. In 1 Samuel 1, Hannah, a wife of Elkanah the Ephraimite, beseeches Yahweh for a child because she is barren, and Elkanahâs second wife Peninnah âprovokesâ (*kaÊ¿as) Hannah on this account. In desperation, Hannah prays to Yahweh, asks for a child, and vows to dedicate the boy to Yahweh if he grants her request. Yahweh hears Hannahâs vow, and she conceives a child, the prophet Samuel. Hannah then dedicates Samuel to Yahweh in Shiloh. 1 Samuel 2:1-10 presents the characterâs celebration of her god and the narrator explicitly states that âHannah prayedâ (wattitpalleÌl hÌ£annaÌ) the material in 1 Samuel 2:1-10. Based on manuscript and internal evidence, 1 Samuel 2:1-10 was added to the narrative after initial composition, which explains its superficial connection to the preceding narrative. 1 Samuel 2:1-10 is composed in classical Hebrew verse that is intertextually coordinated with other biblical poetry, such as Deuteronomy 32:1-43 and 2 Samuel 22âPsalm 18 (among others). The poetic lines are written in typical Northwest Semitic two-part (bicola) and three-part (tricola) parallelism. The poem extols Yahweh as the prototypical god, a god of knowledge and wisdom, one who exacts justice and mercy, grants childbirth, controls life, death, and the whole earth. Finally, the poem celebrates Yahwehâs victory over the enemies of his faithful (hÌ£asiÌd) and assures that Yahweh gives strength to his (unnamed) king. If the poem of 1 Samuel 2:1-10 circulated independently before being added to 1 Samuel, it could have functioned as a royal victory song during or shortly after the monarchic period (ninth to fifth centuries BCE).

2194,The Redeemed Christian Church of God,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) was founded in Nigeria in 1952 by Josiah Olufemi Akindayomi.  The church has a rich history and a profound impact on the global Christian landscape. 
Akindayomi was born in Ondo, Southwestern Nigeria, in 1909.  Although he was born into a family that followed indigenous religions, he later joined the Anglican Church, where he was baptized in 1927.  His religious desire made him move further to the Cherubim and Seraphim Church (C & S) in 1931.  He founded a prayer group within the C&S, which he called Egbe Ogo Oluwa (The Glory of God Fellowship) in 1947.  It was this group that metamorphosed into the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) in 1952.  According to Ogunewu, Akindayomi made several prophetic declarations about the RCCG that have come to fruition. He predicted that the church would spread to all nations of the world and that it would be characterized by mighty miracles and wonders. Akindayomi also foresaw that the RCCG would be at the forefront of a Pentecostal explosion on the African continent. His commitment to prayer, evangelism, and spiritual growth laid the foundation for the churchâs remarkable growth and influence. By the time of his death in 1980, RCCG had about 40 parishes within Nigeria.
Enoch Adejare Adeboye succeeded Akindayomi as the General Overseer in 1981.  Before this appointment, he served as the founderâs interpreter, demonstrating his close relationship with the churchâs origins.  Born on March 2, 1942, in Ifewara, Osun State, Nigeria, Adeboye hails from a very humble family. He often shares the story of wearing his first shoes at the age of 18.  Adeboye went to Ilesha Grammar School in Osun State and started to study mathematics at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka.  Due to the Nigerian Civil War, he completed his first degree in mathematics at the University of Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University) in 1967.  His academic pursuits continued with a Masterâs degree in hydrodynamics from the University of Lagos and a Ph.D. in applied mathematics from the same institution.  Adeboye joined the RCCG in 1973 and initially served as an interpreter. In 1975, he was ordained as a pastor by Pa. Josiah Akindayomi.  By 1981, he had become the General Overseer, leading the churchâs expansion.  The RCCG, which had 40 parishes in Nigeria at the time of his appointment, has now grown to about 198 nations worldwide, with over 9 million worshipers in Nigeria alone.  He is considered a preacher of the holiness movement and emphasizes Christian discipleship through local churches. Adeboyeâs global impact extends beyond Africa, with a great following for the church through various Christian ministries and social efforts  Adeboyeâs vision includes establishing RCCG branches within walking or driving distance in cities, ensuring accessibility for worshipers.
The church emphasizes holiness, discipleship, and obedience to Godâs Word. RCCGâs impact extends beyond Africa, touching lives through ministries and social efforts. In 1990, the RCCG Bible School was founded, nurturing leaders and ministers. The Redemption Camp in Mowe, Lagos, was purchased in 1983, serving as a hub for conferences, retreats, and worship. The Redeemed Christian Fellowship (RCF) for students was established in 1988, fostering spiritual growth among young believers.  The churchâs headquarters, now at 1-5 Redemption Way, Ebute-Metta, Lagos, symbolizes its journey from humble beginnings to global prominence.",1952,2023,2256,1525,Olusegun Olawoyin,57,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,2024-02-17 04:12:52.372 +0100,2024-03-04 18:55:05.728 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.8143345280735038,4.40207360284929e-12,4.77525077112458e-15,0.016445915812490327,5.311496113432217e-05,2.3858226064297124e-12,1.4597890647866803e-15,0.16916644114557183,5.055446893221291e-13
2199,"Prayer for Vengeance against Mariam, Kallinikos, and Others",52,Religious Text (v1.0),"A prayer to the Christian God and his subordinate powers to avenge a woman against a long list of enemies who are implied to have wronged her. This text is one of a number of curses of this type in Coptic and Greek from Christian Egypt from between the fourth and ninth centuries CE, which are distinct from many contemporary curses in presenting themselves as petitions (libellus) to redress past wrongs. This text would have been folded and deposed in a significant site, although the lack of surviving archaeological context leaves this context uncertain; it may have been a grave or shrine. The targets of the curse include twenty named individuals (11 female and 9 male), as well as a number of others identified by other means (such as âthe son of the cumin-sellerâ). It addresses the âLord Godâ as well as various subordinate angelic beings (the archangels Michael, Gabriel, and Suriel, one of the seraphim of the divine presence), the prophet Daniel, and two personified figures â the place in which the text was deposed, and the Lordâs Birthday (Christmas day, perhaps the date of the textâs deposition). These figures are called to âavengeâ the petitioner, and âstrikeâ (apatasse) the targets, presumably with sickness, death, or other misfortunes. Before deposition, the text was folded numerous times to produce a small package; from other texts we know that it was believed that the curse could be undone by unfolding and reading it again.",401,500,136,1577,Korshi Dosoo,58,Jennifer Singletary,2024-02-20 13:07:27.595 +0100,2024-02-22 20:09:36.268 +0100,Prayer in the Ancient World,0.004965497369995715,0.03600592207865022,0.04594539337902356,0.12484403077896149,0.0014653684008442802,1.0920619682393919e-12,0.02958912625154379,0.47688429407378774,0.2803003676661011
2200,The Roman Catholic Mission in Nigeria,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Roman Catholic Church in Nigeria is part of the universal Roman Catholic Church under the authority of the Pope. The Roman Catholic Mission (RCM) in Nigeria is more prevalent in the southern part of the country than the north. The Pope has a representative called the Nuncio (ambassador) in Nigeria. The local church in Nigeria is governed by the Catholic Bishops' Conference of Nigeria (CBCN) in conjunction with the Catholic Secretariat of Nigeria (CSN) as the highest administrative body for decision making for the Catholic Church in Nigeria (CBCN). The Catholic Secretariat of Nigeria (CSN) has her headquarter in Abuja. The current president of the CBCN is Lucius Iwejuru Ugorji (2022), the Archbishop of Owerri Archdiocese. The president of this body is by rotation. The Roman Catholic Mission in Nigeria is hierarchically structured; the Cardinals, Archbishops, bishops, Reverend Fathers, Religious, Reverend Deacons, Sisters, Seminarians and the lay faithfuls.
The Augustinian and Capuchin monks from Portugal were the first set of Missionaries that visited Nigeria. They first came to the present amalgamated Nigeria, through the Benin River and made contact with the Itsekiris during the fifteenth century. Warri was probably the first place they visited but without success. The subsequent enthusiastic Society of African Mission (SMA) was sent by Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith from Rome after the failure of Lisbon and Spanish Capuchin in 1856. The nineteenth century also witnessed the coming of the Holy Ghost Fathers (CCSP) into the country. The SMA went to the Western part of the country while the (CCSP) went to the Eastern part of the country.
Because a significant group of European missionaries gained access to Nigeria through the Badagry port, the town became the historic entry point of Christianity in the country. Rev. Fr. Borghero brought the Catholic faith to Yorubaland. This was done by the pastoral initiative of Melchoir Joseph De Marion Bresillac from France, who founded the SMA with the aim of evangelizing Africa. As early as 1860s a catechist named âPadre Antonioâ was in charge of a nuclear Catholic family that existed in Lagos. The 1868 advent of the SMA marked the arrival of Francesco Borghero to Lagos. The work of evangelization started from Lagos and spread to other areas which are covered today by five provinces: Lagos, Benin, Ibadan, Jos and Kaduna.
The Holy Ghost Fathers (Spiritans) arrived Onitsha in December, 1885 led by Fr. Lutz.  They preferred raising Christian communities and did not put much emphasis on education. The initial evangelization in the lower Niger consisted of buying black slaves, giving them medical care, and bringing them up in a Christian community.
Although attempts were made by the Catholic church to establish their presence in the north in 17th/18th century in Gobir (Sokoto) and Bornu. Around this time, the Kingdom of Kororofa was said to have had nearly 100,000 Christians and a sixty-bed hospital built by a priest. 
 The encounter with Islamic religion in the Niger Benue confluence foreshadowed what problem would later bedevil evangelization and the relationship between Christianity and Islam. As happened with the Protestant mission, the move to the north was halted by British order. However, in 1907 the intrepid Zappa was able to make the 300-mile leap from Asaba to establish the only Catholic station in the north. This was in Shendam in present day Plateau State. The parish remained the only Catholic mission station in Northern Nigeria up to the 1930s. The evangelization of northern Nigeria was very difficult because of the colonial ambitions in the north.  One of the problems was âthe Lugard exclusionâ which forbade missionaries from preaching to Moslems. 
The pastoral activities of the church in Nigeria today embraces a number of directorates manned by the Clergy, Religious and the Lay Faithful for the spiritual, pastoral and social growth of the Country. Each of the directorate is also an agency for the continued evangelisation in Nigeria. They are: The Family Ministries, Marriage Tribunal, the Directorate of Religious Education, Biblical Apostolate, Catechetical Institute, Communication, Health, Justice, Development and Peace Commission, Judicial Commission, Prisons, Vocations, Liturgy, Music, Pontifical Mission Society, etc.  All these Commissions provide social services to the general public without discrimination. They are means by which the CBCN uses to communicates her voice to all and sundry especially to the Nigeria government.",1480,2024,1082,1568,Joseph Ajayi,57,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,2024-02-20 13:28:08.473 +0100,2024-03-29 17:53:43.471 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),1.2258675343361217e-07,0.0015141782507217063,0.0006864485366076154,0.024348565054610454,0.001148970603636115,1.113231086316365e-24,2.3494184252716765e-07,1.6648332025890217e-12,0.9723014800241633
2208,The Book of Judith,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Book of Judith is an ancient Jewish work which details the resistance of Judith, a pious widow, who assassinates an Assyrian general besieging her town. The work narrates the attempted invasion of Judea by Holofernes, and the heroism of Judith, who prevents the destruction of the people and the Jerusalem Temple through her faithfulness, but also her cunning and leadership. The work is often described as being of two halves; the first seven chapters cover the conquests of the Assyrian army and introduce the character of Achior, while chapters eight to sixteen narrate Judithâs infiltration of the Assyrian camp, successfully assassinating Holofernes and breaking the siege of her hometown Bethulia. 

The work is commonly part of the Christian canon, although at least since Jerome, it was not considered on a par with the core of the Hebrew Bible and was attributed a so-called âdeuterocanonicalâ status. The work appears to have limited impact amongst early Jewish readers; there are some references to Judith in rabbinic sources, mostly clustered around particular associations between Judith and Hannukah. 

The work was likely composed around the beginning of the 1st century BCE, although there is some debate about the exact circumstances which may have led to the composition. The earliest reference to the work is known from Clement of Rome, writing around the end of the 1st century CE. The manuscript evidence begins in the 3rd century CE with seven verses of chapter fifteen inscribed on a pot sherd, and the major codices of the 4th and 5th centuries (Sinaiticus, Vaticanus and Alexandrinus) have the full text, with some differences.

These earliest textual witnesses are all in Greek. It was thought for a long time (and presented by Jerome) that the work was likely originally composed in Hebrew, but more recent work has begun to argue strongly in favour of a Greek original; Hebrew features of the text can be explained through connections with the Greek of the Septuagint (the Greek translations of the Hebrew Bible).

The work has inspired a lot of artist representation, which has furthered interest in the Book of Judith, but has also on occasion tended to misrepresent the evidence of the work itself. One notable case is the famous Caravaggio painting of Judith Beheading Holofernes (1598-1599), where Judith's maid (or slave) is depicted as an old women. This woman is said to outlive Judith, herself dying aged 105. While not a significant mistake, the artistic tradition nevertheless contributes to ongoing reception of the Book of Judith.",-160,80,44,1247,Joseph Scales,50,Andrew Danielson,2024-02-22 11:58:27.317 +0100,2024-06-05 22:27:20.221 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),1.015743909715562e-26,4.234017952021299e-26,0.9999999997610243,2.3630338334901714e-12,4.014689612860683e-13,1.347149545713635e-35,3.384354727098698e-16,3.0010275110519173e-37,2.362106794950791e-10

2210,Living Faith Church Worldwide,43,Religious Group (v6),"The founding of the Living Faith Church  International is directly linked with the divine call of the founder in person of Bishop David O. Oyedepo.  So, it is good to begin with the life story of David Oyedepo and how he was called into the ministry. David Olaniyi Oyedepo was born in Osogbo, in the present Osun State, Nigeria  on September 27th, 1954. He is however, a native of Omu-Aran, Irepodun Local Government Area of Kwara State, Nigeria. He was raised in a mixed-religious family. His father, Ibrahim, was a Muslim healer.. His mother, Dorcas, was a member of the Holy Order of the Cherubim and Seraphim Movement Church (C&S), a branch of the Aladura movement in Nigeria. He was raised by his grandmother in Osogbo, who introduced him to the virtues of Christian life via early morning prayers. She also taught him the importance of tithing. After his primary and secondary education, Oyedepo proceeded to study architecture at the Kwara State Polytechnic Ilorin.. He worked briefly with the Federal Ministry of Housing in Ilorin before resigning to concentrate on missionary work. He was born again in 1969, through the influence of his teacher, Betty Lasher, who took an interest in him during his high school days. According to him, he received a mandate from God through an 18-hour vision in May 1981, to liberate the world from all oppression of the devil through the preaching of the word of faith. This inaugural vision led to the founding of the Living Faith Church World Wide (LFCWW), first called Liberation Faith Hour Ministries, in 1981. Two years later, on September 17, 1983, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, ordained David and his wife, Florence Abiola Akano (known as Faith Abiola Oyedepo) to become pastors and officially commissioned the new church. Five years later, he was ordained as Bishop by Archbishop Benson Idahosa. 
Living Faith Church (AKA Winners Chapel International) started in Kaduna but moved to Lagos, the former capital of Nigeria in July 1989, to start a new branch of the church after Bishop Oyedepo received instructions from God to reach out to the people of Lagos.  Since 21st August, 1982, Bishop David Oyedepo has been happily married to his heartthrob, Pastor Mrs. Florence Abiola Akano (now known as Faith). They have four children together (David Jr, Isaac, Love and Joyce). David Oyedepo (Jr) and Isaac Oyedepo were ordained as Pastors in May 2007 by Kenneth Copeland. David Oyedepo Jr formerly pastored the London Branch of the Church with his wife, Kemi but is now the resident pastor of the Ministry's headquarters church (Faith Tabernacle) while Isaac Oyedepo pastors Winners' Chapel International, Maryland, in the United States of America with his wife Ayomitide. His first daughter, Love is married to Stephen Ogah, who also pastors in Winners' Chapel. Joys Priscilla is the last child and second daughter. She got married to Abimbola Abodunrin in 2020.
Bishop Oyedepo began his Church ministry and planted the 1st Church in Kaduna, called, Living Faith World Outreach â Dec. 11, 1983. He published and released his first 2 books; âThe Miracle seed, and The Law of Faith,â in April 25, 1985. He founded the Word of Faith Bible Institute, which today runs across many nations of the world â Sep. 1: 1986. He began church planting work in the northern part of Nigeria â May 1987. His mission acquired a 13-acre property in a prime area of Kaduna city called Garden of Faith â Sep. 1989.  He moved into Lagos, following a divine mandate, âArise get down to Lagos and raise me a peopleâ â Sep. 24, 1989. He founded Dominion Publishing House, whose printing press has today grown to an industrial scale and currently publishing Bibles â July 1992. He led a great revival at the Lagos church that took the church from about 3,500 to 50,000 within 5 years â 1994-1999. 
Following another divine mandate âthe harvest of Africa is overripe, rush in and preserve it from decadence, embark on Mission to Africa. Today, his mission now has a strong presence in over 41 nations of Africa â Jan. 1994.- His Mission took delivery of the first mission aircraft in Sept. 18, 1996. His mission acquired 530 acres of property in the outskirts of Ota, a suburb of Lagos which is today called Canaan land in May 1998. He was able to build 50,000-seat capacity sanctuary called Faith Tabernacle, was built and dedicated within one year between Sept. 1998 and Sept. 1999. He started the annual convocation of Winners worldwide, tagged âShilohâ which now transmits to about 177 nations real time and draws delegates from between 50 and 60 nations annually, with millions gathering at various viewing centres across Nigeria and many other nations of the world  in 1999.
 He embarked on Mission to the world, covering Europe, North and South America, Asia, Australia and Middle East in August 2000.  He founded Covenant University, which is today listed among the Elite Universities of the world â October 2002. He founded Landmark University, a university blazing the trail today within the Nigerian university education space in Mar. 2011. 
He led a great church growth revival that doubled the attendance of the Lagos church twice within 6 months. Today, the Faith Tabernacle is said to be the largest local church congregation in the world, which runs four services every Sunday with about 38,000 Home cells â May â Oct. 2015. By divine instruction, he supervised the planting of over 5,000 churches across Nigeria within one year in 2019.
By divine mandate, he led the planting of over 10,000 churches within one year across Nigeria and over 1,200 others across 35 other nations of the world in spite of the restriction by the global lockdown occasioned by covid-19 pandemic in 2020. Also, by divine instruction, he led the replication of over 21,000 new home cells within one year at Faith Tabernacle, which represents about a hundred percent of the existing home cells in 2021. He further led the planting of Churches in 80 additional nations across 4 continents of the world in 2022. Currently, the construction of the historic 100,000-seat capacity stadium-like sanctuary, whose foundation was laid on March 25, 2021, is very much in progress, with the claim that Godâs hand was clearly evident in the areas of speed, supplies, etc.. 

Canaan Land is in Ota, Ogun state and is the 5,000-acre (20 km2) estate and campus, that houses the 50,000 seat auditorium, the church secretariat, the church's youth chapel, a primary school called Kingdom heritage model school, a full boarding mission secondary school called Faith Academy, with over 1,500 students and the Covenant University facilities - which accommodates over 7,000 students, fully resident in ultra-modern hostel facilities - with fully equipped faculty buildings and numerous staff housing facilities. Canaan land campus also has for-profit establishments operated by the church such as a bakery, a bottled water processing plant, a petrol station, various restaurants and shopping stores, several residential houses that provide for the over 2,000 church employees and guesthouses. Four banks are also present on this Estate, three of which are branches of external commercial banks and one which is a community and micro-finance Bank and operated by the Church. The whole of Canaan land which includes a proposed 15,000 housing estate known as Canaan City had increased to 17,000 acres as at 2012. The Ministry's biggest annual meeting Shiloh, holds every December in the Faith Tabernacle. It hosts thousands of congregants across the world.

Winners Chapel International operates a Bible training programme known as the Word of Faith Bible Institute for members and non-members alike to develop knowledge of Christian principles as well as to develop leaders and future pastors. The institute is run in major branches of the Church. Oyedepo is the president and chairman of David Oyedepo Ministries International (DOMI), the umbrella organisation comprising Living Faith Church World Wide (a global network of churches), World Mission Agency (WMA); the global missionary arm of the church's operations, Dominion Publishing House (DPH - the publishing arm of the church), Covenant University, and the Social Development Missions projects - made up of hospitals, maternity homes, schools, etc. Oyedepo has criticized corruption in Africa as a whole and poor leadership in government.  
The Living Faith Church also operates its own publishing house, called Dominion Publishing House (DPH). Commissioned on December 5, 1992, the publishing house has published over 70 Christian, inspirational and motivational books, mini books, magazines and other resources.",1981,2024,2119,1533,Enoch Gbadegesin,57,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,2024-02-22 15:52:33.852 +0100,2024-03-26 12:48:12.964 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),6.928341618021283e-05,0.10085989256906637,6.7466990488445664e-15,0.09161316109354962,0.06477303755026832,0.561160319155738,2.2106048068829067e-05,0.18150197422601805,2.2594110393232038e-07
2220,Ansar-ud-deen Society of Nigeria,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Ansar-ud-deen Society of Nigeria is a Muslim organisation established in Lagos, Nigeria with a view to developing the Muslim community in terms of education, and enhancing the social and moral development of the Muslims. The organisation was founded in 1923. It is neither a sectarian nor a political educational organisation. In fact, in the typological analysis of Islamic organisations in Nigerian society, Ansar-ud-deen society of Nigeria is considered as one of the first generation Islamic organizations in the country.
The establishment of the organisation in question was informed by a response to the advent of a class of Western trained Christian elites in the colonial capital of Lagos. Thus, this organization emerged to engage in the promotion of reformist ideas and development in the Muslim communities of Lagos and later in Nigeria. Today, the society has gone far to the extent that its branches abound in almost every place where Nigerian Muslims are found at home and abroad. In 1926, the society constituted a mission board assigned to organize the religious related activities such as the celebration of some important Islamic events and dates, open-air praying, child naming ceremonies and fund raising programs. 
The organization has spread all over the towns and cities in Nigeria. And characteristically, any place where the branch is found, there used to be the societyâs mosque where members would be observing their prayers, particularly the JumÊ»ah Salah (Fridayâs prayer) that divinely holds on every Friday in lieu of the Zuhr Salah (afternoonâs prayer) that is being observed in any other day. During the service on Fridays, the chief Imam of the branch will lead the congregants by first delivering khutbah (sermon) before the observance of two rakÊ»ahs. The recital from the Quranic passages in the prayer, including the opening chapter of the Quran, will be made aloud- and this is opposed to the manner of recitation during the middle of the day in all other six days of the week.
In the Ansar-ud-deen Society, women are active major players. They are being carried along with all the organizational activities. The society has a womenâs wing, whereby the majority of the wives of the members too play a vital role in the religious propagation and obligations among their fellow women in the society. As a matter of fact, the womenâs role is spiritual and material. They engage in a prayer session called AsalÃ£tu on Sundays, and make a financial contribution which is of material benefit to the development of the society. Both the men and the women fundraise for the societyâs coffer. The funds generated through the membersâ contribution is being used to run the affairs of the society which include, among other things, building of mosques and madÃ£ris (Arabic/ Islamic schools), sponsorship of many dawah programs through the mass media and so on.",1923,2023,1082,1569,Abdul mumin Alawiye,55,Julian Weideman,2024-02-26 13:33:50.837 +0100,2024-05-05 14:16:32.994 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),1.7307524388454215e-06,0.08920755533019374,0.0019230558504674466,0.042683525741937525,0.000970504772882195,1.6836090157024189e-13,4.859495071514472e-06,0.18999015763575863,0.6752186104210818
2225,"Culdees, CÃ©li DÃ©, CÃ©ili DÃ©, CÃ©le DÃ©,  ""Clients of God"", ""Servants of God"", ""Spouses of God"", ""Companions of God"", Kelidei, Kaledei; CÃ©ile DÃ©",43,Religious Group (v6),"The Culdees (an Anglicisation of the Irish term ""cÃ©li DÃ©"" â Clients of God; singular ""CÃ©ile DÃ©"") were members of a monastic movement (possibly reforming in its nature) that initially appeared in Ireland in the eighth century or individual ecclesiastics emerging from this network, such as it was. The cÃ©li DÃ© constituted individuals and groups of ascetic and eremitical monastics, although their precise nature is obscure and subject to debate. The movement emerged in Ireland in the middle of the eighth century and remained active in the following centuries. The Culdees played a key role in the religious landscape of the Ireland until the burgeoning of foreign religious orders in the twelfth century and the influx of continental Catholicism. They appear to have constituted an elite stratum within the early Irish Church. The Culdees continued longer in Irish-influenced areas of Scotland where the notion of a âCuldee Churchâ has been important to some modern (largely Presbyterian) conceptions of a âpurerâ, independent, or distinct tradition of church governance, organisation, and identity in the pre-modern Scottish or ""Celtic"" Church that is thought to have been at variance with Rome (sometimes referred to as the âCuldee Church). There is some evidence that the group in its earlier stages comprised bands of anchorites which numbered thirteen or communities of twelve brethren and a prior (cenn âchiefâ) in emulation of Christ and the Apostles.  In some places, for example, Armagh â Irelandâs primatial city â the group seems to have continued much longer than elsewhere. In Armagh, the community that was Culdee in origin survived into the sixteenth century before succumbing to the Henrician dissolution of the monasteries in 1541. Although the later community at Armagh was only Culdee in origin, having departed from their primitive form and been superseded by Canons Regular, this origin represents the centrality of the movement to some of the most important religious foundations in Ireland.  The Culdees represented the flourishing of a particular insular kind of Christian monasticism in Ireland following the consolidation of the faith by Patrick in the fifth century and the influx of foreign orders in the twelfth. The Culdees espoused a mission that was centred on secular ministry, austere monasticism, piety, austerity, humility, mortification, simplicity, care of the sick and poor, and the ascetic lifestyle. However, the extent to which the Culdees were a formally organised âorderâ and the exact nature of their vows, monastic rule, community life, and practices are not conclusively understood. Despite these uncertainties, there was clearly a distinct strand within Irish Christianity which can be distinguished by this term. A number of notable historical figures are associated (or thought to be associated) with the cÃ©li DÃ© including Ãengus of Tallaght (or Ãengus the Culdee, author of the FÃ©lire Ãengusso, an important early martyrology from Tallaght), MÃ¡el Ruain, and the Old Irish poet Blathmac mac Con Brettan. Important Culdee sites in Ireland include Armagh, Clones, Clonmacnoise, Devenish Island, Dunshaughlin, Fore, Inis Cathaigh, Lismore, Monaincha (Ros CrÃ©), and Tallaght. Important sites in Scotland include Abernethy, Brechin, Dunkeld, Loch Leven (and the island of St Serfâs Inch therein), Monifieth, Monymusk, Scone, and St Andrews.",700,1100,2283,1422,John Gallagher,49,Ian Randall,2024-02-28 18:28:36.346 +0100,2024-03-01 23:33:58.732 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),5.079851842388409e-14,1.1438778859462749e-12,0.01509226389099827,0.4655831879606693,0.002318856574593074,2.4313177829151694e-12,0.00014267645213327535,5.446319259454086e-11,0.516863015063517
2228,Church of God Mission,43,Religious Group (v6),"This entry is about the Church of God Mission, a Christian denomination (Pentecostal/Charismatic). The Church of God Mission was founded in Nigeria by Benson Idahosa in the year 1972. The root of the Church of God Mission can be traced back to a prayer group that was named Calvary Fellowship which was inaugurated by Edgar Perkings (a clergy) officially in 1965 (though they began meeting in 1962). They started by meeting in a shop on Ivbizua Street, off Mission Road. Benson Idahosa was at that time the Sunday School Superintendent of Assemblies of God Church but on October 26, 1968,  Perkins requested that the leadership of the Assemblies of God church release Idahosa to oversee the prayer ministry. After Idahosa took over leadership, the group moved to Number 26, Forestry Road, Benin City. The group began to experience numerical growth leading to the erection of church buildings. They moved into the Iyaro Church building in 1974 which resulted in more numerical growth. Syney Elton and Gordon Lindsay who were both foreign missionaries were the ones who declared the church open. Benson Idahosa was one of the most outstanding gospel preachers of his time in Africa. He is referred to as a leading Independent âmega-churchâ preacher in Africa. He was trained at the Christ for the Nations Institute, Dallas, Texas (an independent Pentecostal college) for three months in 1971. 

The church Motto is: Evangelism our Supreme Task. Idahosa believed he is sent by God to raise up an army that will go with the gospel to all Nations to teach, preach and heal in the power of the Holy Spirit as exemplified by the life of Idahosa. This led to the church soul conversion efforts, church planting and erection of modern church buildings. The numerical growth of the church led the building of Miracle Centre and dedication in 1975 with seating capacity of over 10,000. He got good financial support for these buildings from American partners such as Gordon and Freda Lindsay, T.L. Osborn and Jim Bakker. Faith Miracle Centre auditorium reputed to seat over 20,000 people was completed in 1986. Several other church building was erected later and the church grew to have branches all over the world. By 1991 Church of God Mission had at least 300,000 members and a ministry headquarters in Benin City, in the southern part of Nigeria. Benson Idahosa and the Church of God Mission had good relationships with other charismatic organizations in Africa and beyond. The mentees of Benson Idahosa (who later became Archbishop) are many, they include; David Oyedepo of the Living Faith Church and the Founder of Covenant University, Christ Oyakilome of the Believers Love World Church, Ayo Oritsejafor of the Word of Life Bible Church, Johnson Suleiman of Omega Fire Ministries, Mike Okonkwo of The Redeemed Evangelical Mission (TREM), Wale Oke, Fred Ado and the Ghanian pastor, Dunkan Williams,

Benson Idahosa was seen as controversial when he promoted the financial and material prosperity of the church by his preaching the wealth and health gospel. Idahosa posits that Christians are supposed to enjoy material things such as televisions, automobiles, have money, possess the good things of life and that the church should not be poor. The church in Nigeria today as a result is one of the wealthiest in the world with more than 30 universities, many primaries and secondary schools, hospitals and other diversified investments. It became controversial because some opined that he emphasized prosperity at the expense of gamine biblical virtues such as faithfulness, integrity and holy living. He had confrontations with witches and wizards during his life time. In a live press conference Benson Idahosa opposed and stopped the proposed world conference of at least 9,800witches and wizard scheduled to hold in Benin City, Nigeria when he threatened that death will be the result for the conveners.The Church of God Mission began The All Nations for Christ Bible Institute to gospel ministers. This institute grew to become the leading bible institute in Africa during Idahosaâs lifetime. The Word of Faith Group of Schools was started to carter for the educational needs of those in pre-nursery, primary and secondary schools. The Benson Idahosa University was started to carter for the tertiary educational needs of the people.  The Faith Mediplex Group of Hospitals was initiated to attend to the medical needs of the people. In 1998 the sudden death of the Founder of the Church of God Mission was announced and his wife and ministry partner assumed leadership of the ministry. It has been reported that Idahosaâs demise had negative impact on the continued growth and unity of the Church of God Mission.
The church of God Mission International Headquarter is located in Benin City, Nigeria, West Africa.

2232,"Lollards, Lollard, the Lollard movement, Lollardism,  Lollardy, Wycliffites",43,Religious Group (v6),"The Lollards were a proto-Protestant, dissident, heretical sect that emerged towards the end of the fourteenth century in England, the ideas of which continued as a strand of religious thought until the English Reformation of the sixteenth century. Lollardy and its adherents were thought to be associated with the Oxford scholar John Wycliffe and his circle of followers, and to follow their ideas and teachings. Although the two groups share ideas, âWycliffiteâ more accurately describes the cadre of academic theologians and associated individuals who followed the teaching of Wycliffe, while the term âLollardâ is more general and denotes anyone or anything deemed heretical, those who criticised the practices of the Church, and those who called for reform. Although the etymology is uncertain, âLollardâ is said to derive from the Middle Dutch verb lollen âto singâ (a derogatory reference to muttering or mumbling) or, more likely, from Latin lolium âtareâ, a sort of damaging weed and a reference to the Parable of the Weeds. Within both the Wycliffites and the Lollards, emphasis was placed on personal faith, vernacular scripture, divine election, and biblical authority. Aspects of Church teaching and practice that they criticised include transubstantiation, clerical celibacy, ecclesiastical hierarchy, indulgences, pilgrimage, iconography, the cult of the saints, fasting and abstinence, and other aspects of Catholic practice. In some respects, the Lollards resemble earlier groups focused on reform, such as the Fraticelli, and exerted significant influence on later continental movements such as the Hussites in Bohemia, which began with the reformer, Jan Hus. Lollard ideas came to enjoy a popular and widespread currency after 1400 and has a significant impact on the theological landscape of the fifteenth-century in England.",1350,1500,2289,1422,John Gallagher,49,Ian Randall,2024-03-04 16:48:47.046 +0100,2024-04-10 00:38:32.187 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.00037261497168714395,0.0769080345114896,2.7271596321494705e-13,0.852798635035872,1.947827443296712e-14,4.295825743939929e-22,8.553223986903179e-15,0.06973192877414103,0.0001887867065093986
2233,The Way of Former Heaven (Xiantiandao åå¤©é),43,Religious Group (v6),"Xiantiandao åå¤©é, the âWay of Former Heaven,â is the common designation of a network of Chinese popular sects that share similar symbols, beliefs, and practices and from which many later Chinese redemptive societies, such as Yiguandao ä¸è²«é (""The Way of Pervading Unity"") and Tongshanshe ååç¤¾ (""The Fellowship of Goodness"") emerged. In addition, Xiantiandao is a significant influence on the Vietnamese new religious movement Cao Dai (Äáº¡o Cao ÄÃ i) that emerged from Sino-Vietnamese sectarian groups in 1920s French-colonial Saigon. 
While claiming descent from a genealogy of enlightened masters that goes back to the dawn of Chinese civilization, Xiantiandao emerged as a distinct religious group in eighteenth-century Jiangxi Province in southeastern China. In this early period, practitioners and outsiders seem to have referred to the sect and its teachings by various names, including Xiantiandao and Qinglianjiao éè®æ (""Green Lotus Sect""), a term that appears in nineteenth-century government surveillance material. Having appealed to traveling merchants and labor migrants in the nineteenth century, Xiantiandao quickly spread throughout southern and southwestern China and, from the 1860s onward, also to Chinese communities in Southeast Asia, especially in Thailand and what is now Singapore and Malaysia. 
Like many other nonofficial sects, Xiantiandao was subject to state persecution and vilification as an âevil sectâ (xiejiao éªæ)âa deprecatory label employed by government officials and cultural elites to criminalize nonofficial religious groups that is still used today in public and political discourses in the Peopleâs Republic of China (PRC). Accordingly, Xiantiandao was banned and persecuted by consecutive Chinese regimes, including the PRC. Thus, although almost entirely eradicated on the Chinese mainland since the early 1950s when it was considered a âcounterrevolutionary sectâ (fandong huidaomen ååæéé), the sect still retained a considerable presence among overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. In fact, state persecution has fueled Xiantiandaoâs translocal spread in many ways. For instance, many practitioners were forced underground following a large-scale crackdown in southwestern China in the 1840s. With many leaders apprehended and executed and forced to act clandestinely, Xiantiandao branched into various subsects and local networks, many of which later evolved into independent sectarian groups. The well-known redemptive societies Tongshanshe and Yiguandao, but also others such as Guigendao æ­¸æ ¹é (âThe Way of Returning to the Originâ) split off from Xiantiandao during this period of instability in the second half of the nineteenth century. 
Similar to many other Chinese sects, Xiantiandaoâs teachings are often described as âsyncretic.â This characterization highlights its peculiar synthesis of established symbols and beliefsâmost notably the so-called âThree Teachingsâ (sanjiao ä¸æ) of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoismâand millenarian beliefs centering on the supramundane creator deity Wusheng Laomu ç¡çèæ¯ (âEternal Venerable Motherâ) and her salvationist mission to rescue humankind from the impending apocalypse. Stressing individual moral self-cultivation as a means to restore oneâs inherent original nature (a Buddhist concept), Xiantiandao practitioners seek to repatriate to Laomuâs âoriginal homelandâ (guxiang æé) from which the early humans were exiled many eons ago. The sectâs teachings are immersed in a narrative of decline and moral corruption, according to which humankind is doomed to be annihilated in the final cosmic apocalypse, and only by following Laomuâs teachings will humans be able to restore their inherent true selves and return to her eternal paradise. Like in many earlier popular sects during the Qing period and many later ones, including Yiguandao and Tongshanshe, this narrative is embedded in a cycle of three consecutive cosmic periods. Even though the final period, which is called baiyang ç½é½ (âWhite Sunâ), represents the beginning of the worldâs end, it also marks the period during which the universal truth is being made available to all of humankind, whereas in earlier cosmic periods, only selected people had access to it. Accordingly, the baiyang period represents a time of high urgency to spread the teachings and help more people avoid the apocalypse. 
Besides highlighting how Confucian-oriented social values are instrumental in actualizing oneâs true self, vegetarianism is crucial in Xiantiandao teachings. Drawing on Buddhist, Daoist, and Confucian notions of meat abstention and fasting, it serves many purposes, from ritual purification to ethical concerns and cleaning up karmic bonds of oneâs past existences. In addition, many Xiantiandao rituals, individual and communal, are conceptualized in Daoist-inspired terms, most notably neidan å§ä¸¹ (âinternal alchemyâ). Adopting the trope of laboratory alchemy to conceptualize meditative practices, neidan practitioners typically seek to invert the natural course of life by refining subtle substances within the human body to nurture an immortal embryo that will withstand the decay and death of the physical body. Finally, as far as we know, Xiantiandao is the earliest Chinese sectarian group to have adopted spirit-writing (fuluan æ¶é¸, âyielding the phoenix,â or fuji æ¶ä¹©, âyielding the planchetteâ) as a means of communicating with deities, Buddhas, bodhisattvas, and deceased leaders. While it was already a widespread practice in many different religious contexts, it was only in the 1820s to 1840s that spirit-writing gained currency in Xiantiandao. It became an essential means of religious text production and a source of legitimacy, especially regarding leadership and organization.
In contrast to Buddhist and Daoist clerics, Xiantiandao sectarians consider themselves lay practitioners, meaning that most live ordinary lives and maintain families. The sect is organized according to a hierarchy of eight ranks, but the exact number may vary depending on which subsect, region, and period one looks at. This system channels access to the sectâs teachings and practices, whereby higher-level (âesotericâ) teachings are only available to accomplished practitioners. The rank-holders at the top of the hierarchy are also responsible for the overall organization and translocal proselytization. In many subsects, the highest four ranks are only available to men. Yet, researchers found that many practitioners and even entire communities are female, especially in Southeast Asia. Thus, during most of the twentieth century, Xiantiandao âvegetarian hallsâ (zhaitang é½å ) in Thailand, Singapore, and Malaysia served as safe havens for unmarried women who sought to evade male-dominated lives and for widows. In traditional Chinese societies, Confucian values of obedience and female subordination strongly compelled girls and women to marry and give birth to children. Accordingly, seeking refuge in a Xiantiandao temple and living a chaste religious life was a rare opportunity to evade male domination.
Because of the PRCâs strict religious policy and anti-sectarian agenda, Xiantiandao has almost disappeared from the Chinese mainland. Even though some communities survived in Taiwan and Southeast Asia and continued to thrive well into the twentieth century, ideological pressure from mainstream Buddhist groups led to a large-scale âBuddhisizationâ of Xiantiandao communities. Accordingly, many sites were converted into Buddhist monasteries and temples, and many sectarian practitioners formally became Buddhist monastics.",1734,2024,2291,1595,Nikolas Broy,45,Matthew Hamm,2024-03-05 16:15:38.348 +0100,2024-03-05 16:15:38.348 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),2.7900258294936377e-05,0.00524535871436191,0.05418978895599243,0.04200255284840699,0.03397141835650429,1.9511576640473462e-24,0.0007705621560175741,1.347820109904305e-12,0.8637924187090741

2237,"Order of Preachers, Dominicans, Friars Preachers, Black Friars, Jacobins",43,Religious Group (v6),"The Dominicans (officially called the Order of Preachers) are a Roman Catholic mendicant order founded at the start of the thirteenth century in France by Saint Dominic, a priest and cathedral canon from Old Castile. The Order is known as the Jacobins in France (where their first house was dedicated to Saint James), the Black Friars in the British Isles and Ireland (after the black mantle or cappa worn over their white habit), the Friars Preachers, Domini canes âthe dogs of the Lordâ or âwatchdogs of orthodoxyâ (because of the role they played in Church Inquisitions), or simply the Dominicans. The order has its origins in a diplomatic mission to Denmark during which Saint Dominic, alongside Diego, Bishop of Osma, encountered the Albigensian heresy in southern France en route to northern Europe. Having completed their mission in Denmark and inspired to join the Danish missionary activity and conversion efforts among the Baltic peoples, the two went to Rome so that Diego might tender his episcopal resignation. Both were instead sent instead by Pope Innocent III to tackle the Albigensian (Cathar) heresy in southern France beginning at Montpellier. Dominic and Diego enjoyed success in their mission among the Cathars. When Diego returned to his diocese in 1207, Dominic sought to establish an order to develop competent, educated preachers who could argue convincingly against heresy. Since its inception, the Orderâs mission is specifically devoted to preaching, study, and education, eschewing manual labour in favour of a direct focus on spiritual work through rigorous intellectual discipline. In a similar fashion to other mendicant orders such as the Franciscans, the Friars Preachers are active in urban centres and embrace corporate poverty. The Order expanded rapidly throughout the medieval and early modern periods. The Order established religious houses and institutions for clerical education (studia generalia) in a great many university cities and towns; the Dominicans established houses in centres of education like Paris and Oxford deliberately to attract university students to the Order. Influential Dominicans include Thomas Aquinas, Albert the Great, Margaret of Hungary, Raymond of Penyafort, Meister Eckhart, Catherine of Sienna, Rose of Lima, and Martin de Porres, among many other notable figures.",1217,2024,2332,1422,John Gallagher,49,Ian Randall,2024-03-06 13:19:42.639 +0100,2024-03-10 20:31:42.483 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.00026566270031584585,0.022324586440391536,0.0009944935442103718,0.05450028159874371,0.0010224121461510779,1.938314973194083e-12,6.562777647078516e-05,0.7585066962115697,0.16232023958020866

2240,"Inka and non-Inka groups in Cusco, Peru",43,Religious Group (v6),"This entry uses ethnohistoric and archaeological evidence to reconstruct religious practices and beliefs among Inka and non-Inka social groups in the late pre-contact Cusco region, the former Inka imperial heartland. The late pre-contact period began with political decentralization and competition between ethnic groups. Leading up to imperial expansion, the Inkas increasingly formalized institutions and developed novel religious practices related to agricultural cycles and mummified ancestors. Meanwhile, non-Inka groups in the surrounding region variably established alliances with the Inkas while likely maintaining relative autonomy and diverse religious practices related to local landscape features. Though Inka religion in Cusco has been extensively studied, understanding neighbouring groups' religious beliefs and practices is necessary to reconstruct the cultural context and sociopolitical dynamics implicated in Inka state formation.",900,1532,2298,1597,Julia Earle,54,Diana Moreiras,2024-03-07 02:39:26.666 +0100,2024-05-31 22:01:51.683 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),1.072846032488622e-13,9.522317326699953e-15,0.8668153098431992,1.26382976293624e-19,0.06118413937078217,1.1054333718368184e-24,0.07200055078590181,3.1484793745415815e-35,1.5189611083613485e-17

2244,"Catholicism in the Latin Empire, Catholicism in the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantium), the Latin Patriarchate of Constantinople",43,Religious Group (v6),"Catholicism was established in the Eastern Roman Empire following the Sack of Constantinople by the forces of the Fourth Crusade (AD 1202â1204). The Crusaders initially intended to recapture Jerusalem (via Egypt), which had fallen to the Muslim Ayyubids in AD 1187.  Due to financial pressures, organisers of the Crusade diverted from their course to help the deposed Byzantine prince, Alexius Angelos, who promised financial backing; once Alexius IV Angelos was crowned co-emperor alongside his previously deposed father, Isaac II Angelos (who was unexpectedly released from imprisonment), it became clear that the promise of support could not be upheld. Therefore, the Latins executed both co-regnants, violently sacked Constantinople, and assumed control of the Byzantine Empire. In this surprising turn of events, Catholicism was established where it had not held sway before. Byzantine territories were divided up, in a process referred to as âpartitio terrarum imperii Romaniaeâ, between the Republic of Venice which was behind the initial campaign, leaders of the Crusade, and the Latin Empire, which established its seat at Constantinople. Although the Latin Empire laid claim to the vassal states it established in Greece and northern Thrace, it really only exerted control in eastern Thrace and Bithynia. It was in these regions of the Eastern Empire that Catholicism obtained.

Installation of the French crusader, Baldwin of Flanders as Emperor Baldwin I led contemporary Byzantines to dub this new form of rule the âFrankokratiaâ (rule of the Franks) or âLatinokratiaâ (rule of the Latins). The new Crusader state was not referred to as the âLatin Empireâ by Latin contemporaries, but as âRomaniaâ (territory of the Romans) or âImperium Constantinopolitanum.â It is worth noting that âByzantiumâ is a later appellation and that Byzantines in the Middle Ages referred to their polity as âÎÎ±ÏÎ¹Î»ÎµÎ¯Î± Ïá¿¶Î½ á¿¬ÏÎ¼Î±Î¯ÏÎ½â (BasileÃ­a tÅn RhÅmaÃ­Ån) and to themselves as âá¿¬ÏÎ¼Î±á¿Î¿Î¹â (RhÅmaÃ®oi). In diplomatic documents, titles in Greek and Latin were used on an equal footing. The Latin emperors, Baldwin and his successors, asserted their authority as imperator (emperor) over both the Romaniae (i.e. Byzantines) and Romanorum (i.e. Romans). 

The failure of the Fourth Crusade, which never reached either Egypt or Jerusalem, led to a unique phase in the history of the Eastern Roman Empire in which Catholicism superseded Orthodoxy in terms of religious authority and dominance. Unsurprisingly, the Latin Empire and its Church faced resistance from Byzantines who identified with Orthodoxy. 

The Latin Empire attempted to adopt a framework of governance that paid deference to both eastern and western ideologies, seeking continuity and assimilation through the use of Byzantine titles and rituals. The Latin Emperor was crowned according to a modified Byzantine coronation ritual. Notwithstanding this religious-political gesture, the new regime placed Catholicism front and centre: Catholic structures replaced Orthodox equivalents throughout the territories it controlled (cf. the replacement of Orthodoxy with Catholicism in Sicily). While Byzantine bishops and clergy continued, the new outpost of the Catholic Church introduced a Latin Patriarch and Catholic episcopal hierarchy, clergy, and religious orders. Orthodox Greek Christians resisted imposed Latinisation, but some compromise was achieved. Pope Innocent III ordered Latins to show tolerance to Orthodox rites, although the divisive matter of papal authority was never questioned. Orthodoxy was not suppressed by the Latins per se, although attempts to enforce obedience to the papacy were sometimes aggressive and obedience to the Latin Patriarch was required. The Pope and the leaders of the Latin Empire probably hoped for unity and expected that Orthodox Christians and clergy would be absorbed into the Catholic Church. On the ground, Latins who settled in the empire practiced Catholicism while Byzantines continued to practice Orthodoxy. 

The Great Schism had created an unbridgeable gulf between Catholic and Orthodox Christians and dogmatic issues (e.g. the filoque) that could not easily be ameliorated. The Sack of Constantinople, and the looting and desecration of churches by the Latins, was brutal. This had a significant impact on how the seismic change in the religious landscape was received and negotiated. Matters were further compounded by internal tensions between the Latin Patriarch (Thomas Morosini was the first) and the Latin Emperor, both of whom were appointed by different stakeholders.

The shift was significant, but ultimately short-lived: Constantinople was eventually recaptured in 1261 by Byzantines following decades of strife between the Latin Empire and the neighbouring Bulgarian and Nicaean empires. Areas of the Mediterranean remained under Latin control until modern times and in such areas a Catholic presence persisted. However, the lasting effects of Catholicism in the region were limited. The Latin Patriarchate continued after 1261, but with responsibility for Catholics in the remaining parts of Latin Greece. The title survived as a titular see until it was abolished in 1964.",1204,1261,2302,1422,John Gallagher,49,Ian Randall,2024-03-09 12:18:29.622 +0100,2024-03-10 20:30:19.531 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.00026566270031584585,0.022324586440391536,0.0009944935442103718,0.05450028159874371,0.0010224121461510779,1.938314973194083e-12,6.562777647078516e-05,0.7585066962115697,0.16232023958020866

2255,Dongxiang,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Dongxiang people  are a Mongolic people and one of 56 ethnic groups officially recognized by the People's Republic of China. Half of the population live in Dongxiang Autonomous County, Linxia Prefecture, Gansu Province, China. The rest are divided over Hezheng County, Linxia City, Lanzhou, Dingxi and Ningxia. According to the 2010 census, their population numbers 621,500, although research has found that the number is inflated due to Hui identifying themselves as Dongxiang for the census, in order to benefit from minority policies.

2264,Puritans,43,Religious Group (v6),"Puritanism was a Protestant reform movement that sought to ""purify"" the Church of England of lingering Roman Catholic ""popery."" As a term, ""puritan"" first emerged in England in the 1560s as an insult against ministers and laypeople who deviated from the orthodoxy of England's church. Puritans believed they were God's ""elect"" according to the Calvinist principle of predestination. They emphasized that a covenantal relationship with God was essential for the erasure of sins. This relationship came on the heels of an initial conversion experience that was emotionally, spiritually, and personally impactful. Salvation was thereafter administered to the saints by their preaching and testifying in partnership with the Holy Spirit: salvation's active instrument. Not to be confused with the Pilgrims of the Plymouth Colony who were theologically separatist from the established church and had ties to Holland, Puritans originally sought reform within the Church of England as non-separatists. Espousing ideas from Calvinism, Puritans perceived themselves as the predestined elect who were tasked to usher in the material Kingdom of God on earth. They promoted strict moral behaviour, presbyterian eldership of churches, and literacy for the sake of widespread Biblical teaching, preaching, and proselytization. Puritans perceived themselves in a similar light to the Jews as God's chosen but persecuted elect. Those who migrated to North America were among the more radical Puritan thinkers who were dissatisfied with the episcopal polity of the state church. Shunned for their congregational ideologies in England and outspoken criticisms, these ""separatist"" Puritans, dissatisfied with the church's stagnation and corruption, migrated from the regions of East Anglia and greater London to realize their ideal of a Holy Commonwealth in the so-called New World. As ""visible"" saints, these individuals withdrew themselves from English cities to institute self-proclaimed cities of God on the ""untouched"" and ""pure"" shores of North America. The early seventeenth century saw waves of Puritans making the dangerous transatlantic crossing. However, unlike earlier migration movements where single young men dominated population outflows, families comprised the majority of Puritan migrants. With men immigrating to North America with their wives and children, settlers quickly outgrew their initial settlements and spread into the adjacent areas of the northeast. As God's elect who were chosen to live and model godly lives both individually and communally, more colonies formed and grew into what eventually became Connecticut, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Maine. By the early eighteenth century, the dissenting nature of Puritanism inevitably led to its own fragmentation as a homogenous group. Its ideals and ideologies were grafted into the tenets of Quakers, Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians, and other Protestant evangelical groups. Although Puritanism itself disappeared by the mid-eighteenth century, Puritans' characteristic moral rigour, self-reliance, and political localism remained distinctive amongst American colonists.",1560,1720,2350,1560,Bethany Henderson,1,M.

2271,The Gideons International in Ngeria,43,Religious Group (v6),"The entry relates to the establishment/inauguration of the Gideons International in Nigeria since 1964 and its growth and activities since then including the ways it has impacted the country and the extent of the success of its activities.
The Gideons International in Nigeria is an association of Christian Business and Professional men who have accepted the Lordship of Jesus and committed to making Christ known through their witnessing, association for Christ and the distribution of the Bibles in the traffic lanes of lives. Traffic lanes of life are places that the association believes that people will pass through at least once in their lifetime. These are schools, hospitals, hotels, motels, police and army formations as well as prisons. The ultimate aim of the association is that every soul encountered in the traffic lanes of life will come to the saving knowledge of the Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ. The association is a part of a worldwide association that operates in 199 countries of the world and distributes bibles printed in 109 different languages. The language of the Bible distributed in Nigeria is English. It came into being in the United States of America in 1899 through the  inspiration of God to John H Nicolson and Samuel E Hill. The name Gideons derives from the story of the Biblical Gideon in the sixth and seventh chapters of the Book of Judges. The Biblical Gideon was a man who was willing to do exactly what God wanted him to do, irrespective of his own judgement as to the plans or results. Humility, faith and obedience were his great elements of character, a standard that the Association is trying to establish in all its members. An integral part of the Association is the auxiliary, which comprises the wives of Gideons who meet the same spiritual qualifications. Ultimately, the association is a family ministry where every member of the family has a part. The Auxiliary are expected to be on their knees praying for the Gideons to be on their feet placing Bibles and witnessing. To be spiritually qualified to be a Gideon and a part of the association,  a person must believe in the Bible as the inspired Word of God, believe in the Lord Jesus Christ as the eternal Son of God, have received Jesus as his personal Saviour and endeavour to follow Him in his daily lives. In addition, a person must believe in the endless lake of fire for the unsaved, accept the Biblical standard of marriage being between one biological man and one biological woman. In addition he must be a member in good standing of an Evangelical or Protestant church, congregation or assembly and should willingly participate in the activities of a camp, a smaller units into which the association is divided. One must also be professionally qualified by being engaged in a work for which one gets regular income. This could be by working for government, other people or being self employed in a business, trade or vocations. The Association is guided by  and lay emphasis on the importance of fulfilling seven Spiritual Objectives: being men and women of the Book (the Bible, the Gideon Guide Book, Cheque Book (for giving), Diary for keeping records) Prayer, Faith, Separated Walk, Compassionate Heart, who Witness and Give. Funding for the mission of the Association is secured through personal contributions and bequests, church offerings, and through the GideonCard Bible Programme (a programme through which members and Believers generally give in honour of their ceremonies (Birthdays, wedding anniversaries, among other ceremonies) or in memory of dear ones, for the printing and placement of scriptures. Since 1964 when the first camp was established in Nigeria, there are 281 camps as at March 2024. These camps have been differently organised in the past as zones. They are now grouped into seven state structures namely South-West, Central-West, North-West, North-East, Central-East, South-East and Central-South each under the direction of a trustee who also doubles as the state president and who is responsible to a national cabinet elected annually at the national convention of the association. The national cabinet comprising the president, vice-president, treasurer secretary/executive director, chaplain and the seven state  trustees is complemented by the national auxiliary cabinet which comprises the auxiliary president, vice-president, secretary/treasurer and chaplain. The national cabinet operates  under the authority and direction of the International Cabinet which is also elected annually at the International convention. The national cabinet positions are replicated at the camp level but with programme leaders (church relations, faith fund, scripture distribution, gideoncard, membership) appointed. Regional Directors in state associations and Area leaders like Area Directors and programme leaders at the state and area levels are appointed. Since 1964, the association has placed over 80 million scriptures in nooks and crannies of Nigeria as part of  over 2.3 billion scriptures that the Gideons in different countries of the world have placed.",1964,2024,2256,1601,Abimbola Adesoji,57,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,2024-03-23 10:11:43.362 +0100,2024-03-28 12:09:17.503 +0100,Database of religion history (DRH),1.2509409369432603e-06,0.0018652861124197043,0.002104000111857775,0.014033569746988052,0.02194429949163539,8.553785405627935e-24,1.0362760704290156e-06,5.580289546785473e-12,0.9600505573145115

2274,IÌjoÌ£ AÌdiÌmuÌlaÌ (An Institutionalised Indigenous Religious Movement in Yorubaland,43,Religious Group (v6),"IÌjoÌ£ AÌdiÌmuÌlaÌ is a unified movement of Yoruba traditional religion that sprung up in Ile-Ife under the leadership of Olorunfemi Osiiga an IÌjeÌÌ£buÌ man in the 1920s. The term IÌjoÌ£ means assembly while AÌdiÌmuÌlaÌ means ""The Personality one can hold on to and be saved"". the term has been adopted to describe Yoruba religion. IÌjoÌ£ AÌdiÌmuÌlaÌ started as a secessionist movement from IÌjoÌ£ AÌdiÌmuÌlaÌ ti KrÌstiÌ (which was a Christian denomination). It was noted that Osiiga's goal was to create a purely Yoruba traditional religious worship system which has since spread to other Yoruba communities of southwestern, Nigeria. IÌjoÌ£ AÌdiÌmuÌlaÌ came into existence in some other communities as a need for social coercion for members of Yoruba indigenous religion. It was noted that the prevalence of Christianity in those communities was gradually driving indigenous religion into extinction which calls for a drastic reaction from practitioners of indigenous religion to have a voice. Such communities include OÌ£ÌlaÌ, MaÌsiÌfaÌ, OÌkoÌ, EÌjiÌgboÌ, OÌsogbo, among others.  IÌjoÌ£ AÌdiÌmuÌlaÌ gained more prominence in IÌleÌ-IfeÌ£Ì, OÌ£ÌlaÌ, MaÌsiÌfaÌ, and several others within Osun State. The membership of the group is drawn from every Yoruba religious group such as IfaÌ, SaÌngoÌ, OÌ£ya, EguÌnguÌn, OÌguÌn, and ObaÌtaÌlaÌ among others. The group population varies from one community to the other. For instance, IleÌ-IfeÌ£Ì has an average population of 220, OÌ£ÌlaÌ 750, and MaÌsiÌfaÌ 630 with women and children inclusive. Some of the distinctive features of IÌjoÌ£ AÌdiÌmuÌlaÌ to the different Yoruba religious groups are the creation of structures within the system, the use of documented text that has unarguably been associated with Yoruba indigenous religion, and the introduction of public service within modernised buildings called IleÌ IÌjuÌbaÌ (worship centres) as opposed to worship in shrines and groves. It is important to note that the temple is regarded as a sacred place where the divinities abide, because of this notion reference is accorded to the temple demonstrated by individual putting off their shoes before entering into the temple. Also individuals bow themselves touching the floor with their forehead in reverence to the divinities believed to be present in the temple.
The group structures comprise both administrative and spiritual: the administrative includes alaÌgbaÌ taÌbiÌ AÌwoÌ£n AÌgbaÌgbaÌ IÌjoÌ£ (Elders), IÌgbiÌmoÌÌ£ IÌjoÌ£ (Council of the assembly), AÌwoÌ£n AkoÌ£ÌweÌ IÌjoÌ£ (Secretaries and Treasurers of the Assembly), EÌ£gbeÌ£Ì AmuÌ IÌjoÌ£ duÌn (which they interpreted as Deacons and Deaconess), EÌ£gbeÌ£Ì OÌ£deÌ£ (Security); while the spiritual involves AdariÌ IÌjoÌ£/OloÌriÌ IÌjoÌ£ (Leader of the Assembly), AsoÌ£seÌ£ IÌjoÌ£ (Preacher), AÌwoÌ£n EÌ£gbeÌ£Ì AkoÌ£rin IfaÌgbayeÌ, IfaÌloÌlayoÌ£Ì, OÌdoÌdoÌ/IÌraÌwoÌÌ£ OÌ£ruÌnmiÌlaÌ (Choir groups for married women, single ladies and the children respectively who dress in their different regalia), among others.
The group days of worship differ from one community to the other. It was gathered that IÌjoÌ£ AÌdiÌmuÌlaÌ in IleÌ-IfeÌÌ£ worship on Sunday while those in MaÌsiÌfaÌ and OÌ£ÌlaÌ worship on Saturday. The form of worship was purely liturgical although it allows for a bit of flexibility. The leading personnel reads from the worship guide while the congregation listens and responds at the appropriate places.
The content of the worship guide begins with a call to worship, then a processional hymn, and salutations to OloÌduÌmareÌ, followed by other oÌriÌsaÌ of Yoruba which includes all deities and OriÌ (destiny) which is often regarded as one of the most important personal oÌriÌsaÌ among the Yoruba. This is followed by IÌwuÌre IÌbeÌ£ÌeÌ£ÌreÌ£Ì IÌsiÌn (Opening prayer) and other features such as OÌ£ÌroÌ£Ì IÌwuÌriÌ (sermon), IÌdaÌwoÌ (collection of plates), IÌduÌpeÌ£Ì (thanksgiving), Orin laÌti oÌ£ÌdoÌ£ AÌwoÌ£n AkoÌ£rin (choir renditions) among others. It should be noted that IfaÌ corpus that are documented in the worship guide forms the major text of every sermon, however, the preacher is at liberty to recite any OduÌ IfaÌ (Ifa verse) he or she deems necessary for his sermon and close the service with a congregational prayer. The group in each community also has aÌjoÌÌ£duÌn which is specific annual festival that they hold in high esteem.",1920,2023,2357,1602,Ebenezer Elesemoyo,57,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,2024-03-24 23:45:26.201 +0100,2024-03-25 21:45:25.888 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.03889908955680644,0.14850445386805372,7.569673686244473e-14,0.36147072294318183,0.009116687727388403,0.1922427369018251,0.20388866367238115,0.04587758461602675,6.07142608049594e-08
2277,Western Zhou Bronze Inscriptions (Xi Zhou jinwen è¥¿å¨éæ),52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The name Western Zhou è¥¿å¨ bronze inscriptions (jinwen éæ) refers to a variety of texts inscribed on bronze vessels and bells, primarily for ritual purposes, during the Western Zhou dynasty, over a time span of less than 300 years, ranging from 1046 to 771 BCE.
Most of the ritual bronzes that came down to us, both inscribed and uninscribed, were found inside burials or, alternatively, in underground hoards, where families who possessed such goods (exclusively noble families) hid them to prevent them from being stolen by their enemies.
The bronze inscriptions themselves represent the main source for their study, given the absence of other contemporary textual sources, along with the characteristics of the bronzes themselves on which they are inscribed and the burials and hoards in which they are found. 
The very metal from which the inscribed vessels are cast, a bronze made from an alloy of copper, tin, and lead, was considered a means of communication with the deity Shangdi ä¸å¸, as well as a symbol of both political and religious power: for this reason, the privilege of casting bronze was reserved for the Zhou king, who shared it with his allies through ritual ceremonies, enabling them to initiate rites for their ancestral spirits. Inscribed vessels were mostly employed in rituals for offering drinking and food sacrifices to the spirits and, in the case of bronze bells, for the music performance during rituals. The ritual employment of inscribed bronzes might signify that the writings, which often included military and political achievements of the owner, were inscribed both for the ceremony participants, the descendants, and the ancestral spirits to be informed. In return for these sacrifices and prayers, blessings from the ancestral spirits were expected, in the form of wealth, longevity, and fertility.  
While, at first, these inscriptions were short phrases that might even only include the name of a clan, gradually they began to display texts about ancestorsâ worship, treaties, war reports, awards, etc. As highlighted in Schwermann 2014, event notations and dedications of bronze
inscriptions often also contain references to authorsâ names, even though more than one individual was involved in the production of an inscribed bronze: the donor and commissioner, a composer who wrote or reworked a pre-existing text, a calligrapher who produced a master copy for the casting, and a caster. 
According to Cook and Goldin 2000, circumstantial evidence seems to prove that, at least as it regards later inscriptions, texts inscribed on bronze possibly derived from longer brush-written records on perishable materials kept by the royal court or aristocratic lineages.
The tradition of casting bronze and inscribing characters on it was inherited from the earlier Shang dynasty å (c. 1600 BCE-c. 1045 BCE), along with other features of the ritual system, such as the veneration of certain deities, including Shangdi, and the great majority of sacrifices to ancestors. The Zhou, however, introduced the concept of heavenly mandate (Tianming å¤©å½) through which the ruler received his right to rule directly from heaven in the form of ""virtue"" or ""power"" (de å¾·).
We distinguish three main phases within the three centuries circa of Western Zhou rule, corresponding to variations in the type and number of bronzes, decorations, and the quantity and length of inscriptions, which implied a gradual differentiation from Shang bronzes: the earliest phase of the Western Zhou Dynasty, the middle period, and the latest phase.
During the earliest period of the Western Zhou Dynasty, most of the bronzes were not inscribed or were inscribed with short texts of up to ten characters, reflecting the Shang tradition. At this time, drinking vessels (such as the jue çµ) were the most commonly cast. The system of bronze casting and inscribing underwent gradual changes starting from the middle Western Zhou period. Firstly, the production of alcoholic beverage drinking and storing vessels gradually diminished, replaced by the increased production of vessels for storing grain and cooked meat (such as the gui ç° tureen and the ding é¼ cauldron), implying a switch in the ceremonial focus from beverages to food and agriculture. Decorative motives evolved from naturalistic and animal-like shapes to abstract and geometric dÃ©cors, including wave- and scale-like motives, implying a gradual decline of Shang taotie é¥é¤®masks, dragons, and tigers (replaced by bird decorations).
Starting from the IX century BCE, a process of standardization of the shape and number of vessels began because of which, by the end of the Western Zhou period, the typologies of vessels were significantly reduced: only two standard types of gui tureen and ding cauldron embellished with abstract patterns were still produced. Around the same period, also large musical bells (yongzhong ç¬é) were commonly cast, reflecting the growing importance of musical performance in rituals. These artifacts were now produced in sets, of huge dimensions, decorated with bold abstract patterns, and inscribed with identical texts. The texts, that originally were short and hidden inside the vessels, became significantly longer and were typically inscribed on the outer surface of vessels and bells, visible even at some distance. The texts began to gradually include lineage histories (up to the first ancestor to work for the Zhou), commemorations for ceremonies of various kinds, feasts, military campaigns, awards, treaties, etc. While the texts gradually became longer and more complex, they also became more and more standardized and repetitive. During the last phase of the Western Zhou, the reiterative style of the inscriptions, together with the decorative patterns of the vessels, tended to be evocative of the past, through references to the dynastic founders, indirectly serving also as historical memory keepers, besides being ritual items. Archaeological evidence seems to prove that, during the latest period of the Western Zhou dynasty, inherited vessels were kept together with the newly earned ones.",-1046,-771,82,1195,Francesca Puglia,45,Matthew Hamm,2024-03-25 13:23:15.388 +0100,2024-03-30 21:58:47.744 +0100,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.04153075167439644,0.892828379115072,0.050352935947450446,0.00554265877321496,2.5075092038844135e-12,0.009745273168757087,1.9476935328665496e-12,1.3166538828218439e-09,4.3998538386610834e-29

2279,The Ndau people of Chimanimani area in Zimbabwe,43,Religious Group (v6),"The identity of the Ndau people is rooted in the Mnonomotapa Empire before colonization. At the present moment the Ndau people are found both in Zimbabwe and Mozambique. In Zimbabwe Ndau people they occupy the south-eastern parts of the country. In Mozambique, the Ndau are found in areas facing the south-west, and their language is called Ndau. The Ndau people specifically occupy the Chimanimani and Chipinge districts in Zimbabwe. That area was formerly called Gazaland In the present day, this is largely a rural area which still needs considerable development. They were named the Ndau because they say Ndau-wee when welcoming or greeting a visitor into their homestead. This is still their practice in the present day. The term has also a geopolitical dimension. The term Ndau denotes space, and in this regard, the term may raise issues to do with a claim to ownership of their space. The language they speak is also called Ndau. Some people also contend that they were named after their language. Social structures and cultural norms serve to unite and bind together the Ndau people. There has not been much change in the way social and cultural activities are practised.  Several of the customs in place in the twentieth century, such as the burial and succession of chiefs, are similar to those practiced centuries earlier. While there has been a few changes with time, the changes have are still applicable and relevant for the present Ndau people. These traditions in Ndau history serve as cultural materials that define aspects of a scripted Ndau identity. Amongst the Ndau people are also special religious specialists who assist the community indigenous knowledge system. Some of the specialists include midwives, nâanga, rain makers and chiefs. These specialists are crucial in preserving both cultural values and the environment. The religious specialists assist the community with the utilization of natural resources responsibly as they strongly believe that the earth or environment is capable of regenerating itself.The Ndau people operate under the influence of a patriarchal social system which upholds the rule and control of men. Men dominate, while women and children are just followers. It is men who hold all decision-making powers, while women and children do not have access to such powers. Women generally do not have a voice to crucial decisions in life. This has resulted in a culture of silence among women in Chimanimani. However the history of these people is highly debatable as there are number of contradictions between narratives from oral tradition and written documents.",1890,2024,2360,1437,TERENCE MUPANGWA,57,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,2024-03-27 08:51:52.919 +0100,2024-03-29 19:08:23.415 +0100,Personal Expertise,0.03744599770983086,0.9343635825454087,5.224903608636761e-14,0.028190419534513594,3.186612072406966e-27,1.3934705708200542e-24,9.863377201525127e-23,2.1019462334667094e-10,3.3604663343713884e-27
2280,Enki and Ninmaá¸«,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"âEnki and Ninmaá¸«â is a short Sumerian literary composition, of circa 140 lines, that addresses the creation of humans and the decree of their destinies. At some point, during the celebration for the anthropogenic act, Enki and Ninmaá¸« seem to compete to find out who can better define the appropriate destinies for some newly created disabled humans. Enki manages to decree a good fate to every single case/creature created by Ninmaá¸«, but on the contrary, the goddess is unable to do so for Enkiâs creature, Umul. As such, the composition ends with Enki being praised.
Several translations for this composition were proposed over the years, beginning with a partial one by Kramer (1944), and a first complete one by Benito (1969), to which more were followed. More recently, Lambert (2013) and Ceccarelli (2016) offered new proposals, working with several manuscripts and copies, mostly dated from the Old Babylonian period, though they also used some bilingual versions exhumed in Nineveh, dated to Ashurbanipalâs reign (668-627).
The narrative can be divided into two main parts, with different sections each. The first part starts with a description of the cosmic status quo in a distant time, where a group of âminorâ gods worked for the group of the âseniorâ ones at great expenses (lines. 1-11). Upon hearing their complaints, Namma, the primeval goddess, felt compelled to act, thus exhorting her son, Enki, to create a âsubstituteâ for the divine workers (lines 12-23). After pondering on the matter, Enki agrees to act, summoning several goddesses related to creative powers, and together the first humans are molded from clay (lines 24- 37, followed by some fragmentary lines). 
When the narrative resumes, which can be identified as the beginning of the second part, the deities are feasting together, celebrating the anthropogenic act (lines 44-71). The abundant consumption of beer, particularly by Ninmaá¸« and Enki, provoked some enthusiasm, leading the goddess to brag on her capacities to decree destinies to every single human (ls. 52-55). Enkiâs reaction is immediate, defying the goddess to a contest: he claims he will define a good fate to every single human with disabilities she fashions, and defies her to do the same to a creature of his own making (lines 56-61). For seven times, Ninmaá¸« creates these humans with disabilities or illnesses (the first on the hands, the second on the eyes, the third on the feet, the fourth with some kind of a mental problem, the fifth with a genital condition, the sixth with infertility and the last one as a human with no sexual organs) , and for seven times, Enki decrees a good fate for them (respectively: unspecified service for the ruler, musician for the ruler, silverwork, unspecified service for the ruler, healing of the genital disease, service to the queen as weaver, and, lastly service for the ruler) (lines 63-82).  
Then, Enki fashions Umul, who some scholars (Kilmer 1976: 267; Rodin: 2014:293; KaÄnici 2018: 442) understood as a premature child or even (an aborted?) not fully developed baby, that displays several disabilities, to whom Ninmaá¸« is unable to decree a good fate (lines 83-101). In the last section, both deities exchange words, with the goddess seemingly accepting the winning and thus the superiority of Enki, who is praised by the narrator (lines 102-141).
As such, one can say there are two intertwined topoi in this composition: the anthropogonic account, which according to Frymer-Kensky (1977: 155) and more recently Pinto (2014: 17-18) was deeply influenced by the famous epic composition Atraá¸«asÄ«s; and the explanation for the divine-origin of disabilities and illnesses, with accordingly solutions for their societal integration (either by decreeing them functions or by providing the means to cure/relieve the ailment). Both topoi are entangled in the theocentric mentality that these literary compositions display, diachronically.",-1900,-1600,476,1468,Isabel Gomes de Almeida,50,Andrew Danielson,2024-03-27 19:16:52.984 +0100,2024-04-04 22:53:33.900 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),4.2840571386955804e-13,2.743390243490039e-20,6.971889023304683e-14,0.006565367196616381,1.3040716888629324e-26,4.1126810477357495e-25,0.9934346328028788,2.106423428591246e-19,6.637540371572171e-15

2285,Enki and Niná¸«ursaÄa,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"âEnki and Niná¸«ursaÄaâ is a Sumerian literary composition of circa 280 lines that addresses the divine creative processes, at several levels, while exploring the tension between the protagonist deities. Because it is set on a land idyllically described, Dilmun, it was initially compared with the biblical paradise, a notion now long abandoned. 
Kramer was the first to attempt a full philological publication (1945) whose translation he revised some years later (1955). Attinger presented his own proposal several decades later (1984), followed by other authors in the years to come (Jacobsen 1987; BottÃ©ro and Kramer 1989, RÃ¶mer 1993, for instance). Though its origins are older (at least from the Ur III period) the main known copies of this composition are dated to the Old Babylonian period and seem linked with school contexts (Rodin 2014:116). Several references point out to a strong influence of its content in the elaboration of the Sumerian compositions known as âEnlil and Ninlilâ and âEnlil and Sudâ (Cooper 1989, Vantisphout 1987). 
The narrative begins with an idyllic description of the land of Dilmum (modern day Bahrein), where Enki and his divine consort, Ninsikila rest (lines 1-28), in what can be seen as a state before the divine creative process begun (Lambert and Tournay 1949:122; Alster 1978:16) Yet, as water is lacking, the goddess asks Enki to make the land fertile, to which he complies, further stressing that Dilmun will be so rich that it will become an emporium (lines 29-49). Next, according with the version of the manuscript from Ur, there is an interpolation (KomorÃ³czy 1977) focused on the richness of the trade carried out in this maritime trading port. Numerous products (mainly precious metals, stones, and woods) and several regions, which were commercial partners of the cities of Sumer, are thus alluded (ls. 49Aâ 49V). Afterwards, the main narrative resumes, with the description of the creation of the abundant waters, as the sun-god Utu rises, thus turning Dilmun into an emporium, as Enki had previously stated (lines 50-62.). 
This deity is thus described as being within the marshes, where he ejaculated into Nintur/Niná¸«ursaÄa, who got pregnant and gave birth to Ninnisig (lines 63-87). Three similar sections are then described: from the marshes, Enki sees a goddess (Ninnisig, Ninkura, Ninimma, respectively) who catches his attention, and, after talking with his divine assistant, Isimud, they sail ashore. A sexual act is performed, the goddess gets pregnant, and gives birth to another goddess, who in turn gets the attention of Enki, who is on the marshes, repeating the events (ls. 88-107; 108-126; 126A-126CC, respectively).
Uttu seems to break the cycle. In a rather fragmentary passage, she receives instructions from Nintur/Niná¸«ursaÄa (lines 127-146) and when the narrative resumes, the meeting with Enki is described in different terms: Uttu asks for gifts, to which Enkiâs complies (lines 147-165). With the gifts, he presents himself at Uttuâs door, being welcomed inside her house. It is only then that the sexual act is performed (l. 168-189). Impregnated, Uttu gives birth to 8 plants to which Enki, after tasting them, decrees its fates (lines 190-219). This act seems to infuriate Niná¸«ursaÄa, who curses him, making him ill, a situation which impels a fox to try to mend things (lines 220-246). After some missing lines, Niná¸«ursaÄa is described as seating Enki on her vagina, healing 8 of his body parts, by creating a deity from each one: Ab-u from the top of the head; Ninsikila from the hair; Ningiriutud from the nose; Ninkasi  from the mouth Nazi for the throat; Azimua, from the arm; Ninti from the ribs, and Ensag from the sides (lines 247-271). The narrative comes to an end with new fates being decreed by Niná¸«ursaÄa to these deities, and with a praise to Enki (lines 272-281)  
The multi-nuanced fertile actions of Enki can be read as a way to legitimate his power over Niná¸«ursaÄa within the pantheon. Yet, as Rodin (2014: 218-220) postulated there was still a need to maintain the imperative presence of both female and male deities in the creative processes, which can explain the active role of Niná¸«ursaÄa throughout the narrative. 
This interpretation runs parallel to a political-religious discourse of dominance over Dilmun, probably during the Ur III period (Alster 1983:59), which can lead to other fruitful analyses on the dynamics of ancient southern Mesopotamian context, independent from the (initial) biblical lens.",-1900,-1600,476,1468,Isabel Gomes de Almeida,50,Andrew Danielson,2024-03-28 19:25:12.072 +0100,2024-04-04 22:52:20.546 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),4.2840571386955804e-13,2.743390243490039e-20,6.971889023304683e-14,0.006565367196616381,1.3040716888629324e-26,4.1126810477357495e-25,0.9934346328028788,2.106423428591246e-19,6.637540371572171e-15

2295,Nergal and EreÅ¡kigal,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"âNergal and EreÅ¡kigalâ is an Akadian literary composition focused on describing how Nergal became ruler of the Netherworld, the Mesopotamian cosmic domain of the dead, traditionally ruled by the goddess EreÅ¡kigal. Two main versions of this narrative are presently known: the earlier one was found in Amarna (Egypt), and though it was probably written down during the mid-15th century BCE, the copy exhumated is dated to the 14th century BCE (Pettinato 2000: 5, 47). As for the later version, which is considered the standard one, it is known through two copies, one from Sultantepe (Turkey) dated to the 8th-7th centuries BCE, and another from Uruk (Iraq), dated to circa 500 BCE. Throughout time, several specialists proposed the translation of these versions, such as Gurney (1960), Dalley (1989, revised 2000), Izreâel (1997), Pettinato (2000) or Ponchia and Luukko (2013).
Though they differ in length, both versions describe how there was a divine banquet in heavens to which EreÅ¡kigal could not attend, as she could not leave her domain. She therefore sent her divine assistant, Namtar, who is received by all deities with the necessary protocolar respect. Yet, one god, Nergal, did not paid his respects, which was considered a great offense to EreÅ¡kigal. In the shorter Amarna version (circa 90 lines), the queen of the dead swears to kill him, to which Nergal, with the help of his father, the god of wisdom, Ea, responds by attacking that realm assisted by several daimÅnes. He succeeds in taking EreÅ¡kigal from her throne, and as he was ready to kill her, she persuaded him to become her spouse and therefore to become lord of the Netherworld.
The longest standard version (circa 350 lines) tells a different story, though the outcome is similar: sent by Anu to the Netherworld to apologize for his protocolar faux pas, Nergal is instructed by Ea to not engage in some acts while there, which included not having sex with EreÅ¡kigal. Yet, after resisting a first time when faced with her seductive naked figure, while she is getting ready to bathe, during a second sight, Nergal cannot control his desire, and the two passionately embrace. The couple shares the bed for 6 days and 6 nights, but when the seventh day arrives, Nergal leaves her, and returns to the heavenly domain. Angry, as she does not want to be separated from him, EreÅ¡kigal sends Namtar to get him back. After some trouble in identifying Nergal (as he was protected by Eaâs action), Namtar finally finds him, bringing him back to the Netherworld. This time, Nergal violently bursts through the 7 gates of that domain, quickly arriving at EreÅ¡kigalâs presence. He then grabs her by her hair and takes her to bed. Again, they spend 6 days and 6 nights together, and at the arrival of the seventh day, in a rather fragmentary passage, Anu seems to blesse their union/marriage, and as such, Nergal becomes ruler of the Netherworld.
This narrative displays parallelisms with other Sumero-Akkadian compositions, such as âIÅ¡tar's Descent to the Netherworldâ, as some of the formulae used are practically the same, especially in what concerns the way the Netherworld is first described (âas a place of no returnâ) as well as in the threat EreÅ¡kigal makes if Nergal does not return to her company (of âraising the deadâ). Also, the instructions Ea gives Nergal, before he goes to the Netherworld, are quite similar to the ones this deity gives to the creatures he moulded to save Inannaâs from the imprisonment (death!) on that cosmic domain, in âInannaâs Descent to the netherworldâ, as well as the instructions the famous Urukian hero gives Enkidu in Tablet XII of the âGilgameÅ¡ Epicâ (Almeida 2023: 302-303). Also, as Abusch (1986:186) first noted, there are some parallels between the Amarnaâs version passage where EreÅ¡kigal persuades Nergal to become her husband, and the episode narrated in Tablet VI of the âGilgames Epicâ, where IÅ¡tar proposes to the eponymous hero.
Nevertheless, though evoking and using several (older) traditions, this composition seems to have been created circa mid-second millennium BCE to accommodate the change in the Netherworld throne, which until the Old Babylonian period seemed to belong solely to EreÅ¡kigal (BottÃ©ro and Kramer 1989: 454; Katz 2003: 404-420; 2005:82-83).",-1600,-500,476,1468,Isabel Gomes de Almeida,50,Andrew Danielson,2024-04-03 15:19:28.898 +0200,2024-04-04 22:54:10.609 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),9.492060654542965e-23,3.7472742380230916e-22,1.4801431845960283e-11,0.9999999999537599,2.890667015426108e-34,5.766711329377629e-23,3.1438782997869123e-11,4.818601841020915e-31,3.136750000910369e-32
2296,Taiyi jiangxing tu å¤ªä¸å°è¡å,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The Taiyi jiangxing tu å¤ªä¸å°è¡å is a painting on a silk cloth, unearthed from Han æ¼¢ Tomb No. 3 in Mawangdui é¦¬çå , which includes both texts and figures. The tombâs owner died in 168 BCE and was the son of the Marquis of Dai and Chancellor of Changsha, Li Cang (who died in 186 BCE and was buried in Mawangdui tomb n. 1) and Lady Dai (who died after 168 BCE and was buried in Mawangdui tomb n. 2). The diagram was found together with a large number of manuscripts and artifacts, including medical works, other diagrams and maps, a collection of Huanglao é»è texts, a copy of the Zhanguo ce æ°åç­, and early editions of both the Yijing æç¶ and the Daodejing éå¾·ç¶.
Several names have been attributed to this diagram by various scholars. The first one was She shen tu ç¤¾ç¥å, attributed to the painting by Zhou Shirong, based on the character She, written and encircled under the left arm of the central figure. Li Xueqin and Li Jiahao proposed the title Bing bi Taisui tu åµé¿å¤ªæ­²å, Li Ling the title Taiyi bi bing tu å¤ªä¸é¿åµå, Chen Songchang, Taiyi jiangxing tu å¤ªä¸å°è¡å, Hu Wenhui, the title Taiyi chuxing tu å¤ªä¸åºè¡å, and Lai Guolong, the title Taiyi zhu tu å¤ªä¸ç¥å. The Taiyi jiangxing tu has been found inside a lacquer box, folded together with other silk manuscripts, broken into several fragments. Zhou Shirong, from the Hunan province museum, reassembled it into a 43.5x45 cm cloth. 
In the upper section of the cloth, the most severely worn, only part of the central figure and the Rain and Thunder gods on its sides are still visible. In the middle of the cloth, there are four other figures that, according to Lai Guolong, possibly represent four martial arts disciples. Three dragons are pictured in the lower section of the cloth: one black dragon in the center, which stands just below the central figureâs legs, one yellow dragon on the right, and one azure dragon on the left. 
The figure in the central section of the cloth is pictured wearing a horned hat and black shorts. It has been identified with either Taiyi or the god of the land, She ç¤¾. These associations are based on the texts written in proximity to the character. Above its right shoulder, the name Taiyi appears, while She is written under his left arm. Li Ling, Chen Songchang, Li Xueqin, and others identify the central figure as Taiyi. Li Jianmao and Hu Wenhui identify the same figure as the deity She. Both Zhou Shirong and Lai Guolong claim that it might represent both Taiyi and She at the same time. Lai Guolong further claims that this figure might as well represent the legendary emperor Yu ç¦¹, in the role of a protector for the traveler during his journey, as well as the traveler using the diagram himself. The mention of Yuâs proceeding appears as a possible reference to the pace of Yu (Yu bu ç¦¹æ­¥), a mystic dance that originated from Yu the Greatâs dragging walk after having exerted himself while managing the flooding waters.
The theme of travel is also reinforced by both the sections of text readable on the cloth and the style of the clothes worn by the central figure.
This diagram has been long understood as a model for a blessing or a template for guiding a ritual, based on the use of the indefinite pronoun mou æ, that needs to be replaced with the actual information during the ritual: æä»æ¥ä¸[è¡ï¼]. The template also imparts precise instructions on gestures, such as not looking back and spitting to the left and to the right, and includes references to celestial coordinates (e.g., the position of the Big Dipper).
As for the specific type of ritual in which it was to be employed, it is still a matter of debate. Hypotheses range from military use of soldiers to avoiding troops, from shielding during a journey away from one's home to protection during the deceased soul's ascent into the netherworld.",-221,-194,598,1195,Francesca Puglia,45,Matthew Hamm,2024-04-03 19:40:38.854 +0200,2024-04-10 10:36:05.308 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.0105612977468855,0.08830784192782277,0.1273458084854605,0.19081784114170766,0.014047167754406403,0.019677801518613654,0.45757754092328345,0.03620971837905909,0.0554549821227608
2297,Waldensians (Waldenses),43,Religious Group (v6),"The Waldensians, or the Waldenses, were members of an ascetic Christian movement that originated in Lyon, France during the twelfth-century. Peter Valdes (or Waldo), a formerly wealthy merchant from Lyon, is attributed as the founder of this so-called proto-Protestant sect in pre-Reformation Europe. Eager to acquire knowledge for biblical teaching, Waldo organized the translation of the four Gospels from Latin into Arpitan (a Frano-ProvinÃ§ial dialect). Around 1170, after reading the account of Jesus and the rich young ruler (Matthew 19:16-30, Mark 10:17-31, Luke 18:18-30), Waldo sold his possessions and gave all he had to the poor. Waldo was especially struck by the verse, ""If you want to be perfect, go and sell your property and give the money to the poor"" (Matt. 19:21); to which Waldo (and his followers) practiced literally. Waldo began preaching as a layman in Lyon (1170-1176) and quickly attracted a following in southern France. His movement became known as ""Paupers du Lugduno"" or ""The Poor of Lyon."" However, due to Waldo's scant theological training and use of a non-Latin translation of the Bible, ecclesiastical authorities had issue with his message. In 1179, Waldo attended the third Lateran Council in Rome and was confirmed in his vow of poverty by Pope Alexander III. At this council, he gave his Profession of Faith (which still exists): a statement of orthodox beliefs that individuals accused of heresy were required to sign. Waldo originally sought reform within the church and did not condone its destruction. Nevertheless, being dissatisfied with Rome's recognition of his movement's main message, he continued his ministry. His audacious defiance eventually led to the group's denouncement by the archbishop of Lyon, and were ascribed as a heretical sect by Pope Lucius III in his papal bull ""Ad abolendam"" (1184). Soon after their excommunication, Waldo and his followers formally departed from the tenets of the Roman Catholic Church. They rejected many of the seven sacraments, such as the practice of selling indulgences, the confession of one's sins to a priest, infant baptism and partial baptismal submersion, and the doctrine of transubstantiation. They also renounced the idea of purgatory, prayers for the dead, and the worship of saints. The organization of Waldo's movement reacted against the great ostentatious displays of the existing medieval church and the worldly depravities of its contemporary churchmen. As a staunch anticlerical group, the Waldensians believed the church had lost its spiritual life by becoming wealthy, powerful, and privileged. The Waldensians' emphasis on poverty was not perceived as a spiritual value, but as an exact evangelical design to model in one's life that stood in stark contrast with the church. To further reflect their lack of confidence in the ecclesiastical order, Waldo and his followers promoted the equitable participation of men and women in the preaching and teaching of the Bible. This challenged the church's monopoly on exclusively male priestly preaching by barring vernacular translations of the Latin Bible. By gaining access to the Word of God as laymen, Waldo and his followers accepted the Bible as the sole and total authority of all doctrine. They opted to hold simple services in their homes and outdoors to mirror the apostolic model of the early church. Over time, however, the French Catholic authorities persecuted the Waldensians to the point of the sword due to ongoing pressures from Rome. Many were forced to leave the diocese of Lyon and fled for safer haven in the Alpine region of Piedmont and Lombardy in northern Italy (to this day, the valleys of Val Pellice, Val Chisone, and Val Germanasca in Piedmont are known as ""Waldensian valleys""). Subsequent inquisitions and persecutions against the Waldensian heresy continued throughout the thirteenth-century, forcing many communities to flee and disband. The violence reached a peak in 1487 with Pope Innocent VIII's bill for the extermination of the Waldensian heresy. Several crusades were conducted against Waldensian communities which led to their virtual extermination in southern France and Lombardy. In 1532, the Waldensians joined the Protestant Reformation after hundreds of years of persecution. This new identify as a Protestant sect enabled them to receive support and political protection from Protestant nation-states, allowing the faith to endure into the modern era.",1173,1699,2375,1560,Bethany Henderson,1,M.

2312,The philosophical system of 'Ubuntu' in Southern Africa,43,Religious Group (v6),"The terms Ubuntu/Botho/Hunhu are of the local languages indigenous to southern Africa. They are of Zulu/Xhosa/Ndebele/Sesotho/Shona origin referring to the moral attribute of a person, who is known in the Bantu language as Munhu (Among the Shona of Zimbabwe), Umuntu (Among the Ndebele of Zimbabwe and the Zulu/Xhosa of South Africa) and Muthu (Among the Tswana of Botswana) and Omundu (Among the Herero of Namibia) to name just a few of the Bantu tribal groupings. Though the term has a wider linguistic rendering in almost all the Bantu languages of Southern Africa, it has gained a lot of philosophical attention in Zimbabwe and South Africa, especially in the early twenty-first century for the simple reason that both Zimbabwe and South Africa needed home-grown philosophies to move forward following political disturbances that had been caused by the liberation war and apartheid respectively. Philosophically, the term Ubuntu emphasises the importance of a group or community and it finds its clear expression in the Nguni/Ndebele phrase: umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu which when translated to Shona means munhu munhu muvanhu (a person is a person through other persons).  Hunhu/ubuntu is a traditional and/or indigenous philosophy focussing particularly on cohesion as distinctive features of groups, its components and how it is deployed in the public sphere.",-1800,2024,2389,1436,Peter Masvotore,57,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,2024-04-05 09:40:41.567 +0200,2024-04-24 13:00:24.616 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.15160335249991028,2.5195286581082496e-12,6.926614594550554e-26,3.7055429605809384e-13,0.06507190961738528,0.7833247378797045,1.0249828108867977e-16,1.0984070700693956e-13,1.4583902187347367e-27
2313,Dungan people,43,Religious Group (v6),"Dungan is a term used in territories of the former Soviet Union to refer to a group of Muslim people of Hui origin. Turkic-speaking peoples in Xinjiang Province in Northwestern China also sometimes refer to Hui Muslims as Dungans. In both China and the former Soviet republics where they reside, however, members of this ethnic group call themselves Hui because Dungans are descendants of historical Hui groups that migrated to Central Asia.",600,2024,2390,1527,Jonathan Ouellet,55,Julian Weideman,2024-04-05 12:49:23.523 +0200,2024-04-05 12:49:23.523 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.0003036857640932551,0.026341806773536147,1.778897188823537e-15,0.033433137816339595,0.00013187420492354575,2.2090623598624163e-12,6.549260936274293e-05,0.9113341694201208,0.02838983340941306
2320,Sanjiejiao (ä¸éæ),43,Religious Group (v6),"Sanjiejiao (ä¸éæ), or Pufa-zong (æ®æ³å®), the Three-Stages Movement, is a Buddhist Sect founded by the Zen master Xinxing (ä¿¡è¡, 540~594) in the Sui-Dynasty China, banned by the Tang Dynasty, and gradually disappeared then. Sanjiejiao is mainly based on the pufa"" (æ®æ³, universal dharma)"" doctrine while its main classics, Sanjie Jilu (ä¸ééé, Sanjie Collection) and Sanjie Fofa (ä¸éä½æ³, Sanjie Buddhism), were compiled based on the Huayan Classics and others. All were lost after the Tang Dynasty, while the complete Sanjiejiao documents were discovered in Jinchuanwan Village (Chunhua, Shaanxi) in 1981. Some classics were introduced to Japan in the early Tang period, inspiring Japanese adherents to continue the school afterwards. Sanjiejiaoâs philosophy bases on the Buddhist Sad-dharma Puá¹á¸Ã¡rÄ«ka SÅ«tra, or the Fahua SÅ«tra (æ³è¯ç¶/The Lotus SÅ«tra), divides the evolution of the universe into the True Dharma (æ­£æ³, Zhengfa; Sad-dharma), The Likely Dharma (åæ³, Xiangfa; Sad-dharma-pratirÅ«paka), and the Declining Dharma (æ«æ³, Mofa; Sad-dharma-vipralopa). Sanjiejiao aims at asceticism and humiliation, advocating that everyone has his own âdharmaâ in his heart-mind, so he can practice âdharmaâ to achieve a transcendence. Sanjiejiao advocates the concept of Tri-kÄla (ä½æ³ä¸æ, Three Stages of Buddhism), divides Dharma into three categories based on time, place, and people, and each category, in turn, is divided into three phases (sanjie). The three phases of time include the True Dharma lasting for 500 years (after Buddhaâs death), the Likely Dharma lasting for 1000 years, and the Declining Dharma lasting for 10,000 years. The place is divided into the Land of Purity (åå, Jingtu), the land of the dirty (ç§½å, Huitu), and the secular world. Sanghas are divided into the Wise Monks (æºæ§å§ç¾, zhihui sengzhong) and the Mute Sheep Monks (çç¾å§, yayang seng). Due to the limitation in capacity, the Mute Sheep Monks should practice âformless samÄdhiâ (ç¡ç¸ä¸æ§, wuxiang sanmei) to achieve the goals. Sentiment beings are divided into three levels based on their moral roots: the ""bodhisattvas"" who have the ability for the One Vehicle [the EkayÄna]; the ones have the ability for the Three Vehicles [that of the Åravaka, the pratyekabuddha, and the bodhisattva] and practiced âformless samÄdhiâ in their previous lives; and those who break the precepts and the views, thus residing in communities to practice the pufa doctrine. Sanjiejiao highlights the role of the ânever despiseâ SadÄparibhÅ«ta Bodhisattva and advocates reciting Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva, instead of Shakyamuni Buddha. Sanjiejiao focuses on the pufa doctrine, all sentiment beings have âBuddha-natureâ and deserve to get âuniversal venerationâ (æ®æ¬, pujing).",500,800,2398,1614,Ngoc Tho Nguyen,6,Matthew Hamm,2024-04-06 19:17:13.567 +0200,2024-04-15 06:11:17.798 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),7.149196247611759e-13,4.7902816288535526e-14,8.099728633874232e-12,2.6062838472213945e-11,0.9771959942572269,2.1704566535501765e-12,0.02280400570567631,7.817318913524871e-35,9.24702570228397e-16

2325,"Outer alchemy (å¤ä¸¹, waidan)",43,Religious Group (v6),"Outer Alchemy (å¤ä¸¹, waidan), corresponding to Inner alchemy (åä¸¹, Neidan), is a Daoist doctrine and methodology focused on cultivating personal morality and compounding elixirs (jin/golden cinnabar) from minerals, metals, and herbs for the sake of conferring longevity and immortality. Outer alchemy is based on Laozi's ""Dao"" philosophy, adding Zhuangzi 's transcendental thought and Zhang Daoling's mystical theory, and advocates practitioners to cultivate immortality (ä¿®ä», xiuxian) by training Confucian ethics, valuing the dao (é), refining and ingesting elixir. In practitionersâ faith, elixirs can activate and nourish qi (æ°£, energy), thereby vitalizing the peopleâs physical health and attain mental transcendence. Outer alchemy had been mentioned during the Western Han Dynasty (202 BC â 9 AD) by esoterica masters (æ¹å£«,  fangshi ) and written in Yantie lun (ãé¹½éµè«ã, Discourses on Salt and Iron, ca. 60 BCE.), Hongbao yuanbi shu (ãé´»å¯¶èç¥è¡ ã, Arts from the Garden of Secrets of the Vast Treasure), Hanshu (ãæ¼¢æ¸ã), many  Taiqing å¤ªæ¸ Daoism text, especially in Ge Hongâs Baopuzi (ãæ±æ´å­ã, He Who Holds to Simplicity). Outer alchemy developed mostly during the Tang Dynasty, however, the abuse of elixirs led to unexpected deaths of Emperor Wuzong (r. 840â46), Xuanzong (r. 846â59), and possibly also Xianzong (r. 805â20). From the late Tang onward, outer alchemy gradually declined.
Ge Hong (also Ko Hung èæ´ª, 283-343 CE, Danyang, Jiangsu) is one the most well-known Waidan masters. His main text, Baopuzi, consists of Neipian (åç¯, â20 Inner Chaptersâ, focusing on alchemical studies and the pursuit of immortality) and Waipian (å¤ç¯, â50 Outer Chaptersâ, stressing the importance of Confucian ethic cultivation of the secular lives). Against the background of the long period of chaos (220-589 CE), Ge Hong founded esoteric studies, immortality cultivation and outer alchemy based on the natural principle of âmetamorphosesâ (è®å, bianhua)"". Ge considered this profane world is not âclosed, final, and perpetual realityâ; instead, it is âinfinite, boundless, and endless world of new thingsâ that only transcended immortals (xian, ä») could access. Transcended immortals, in Geâs thought, are ânon-aging, non-dyingâ beings who are living in the fairy world of eternal happiness. A man must maintain his purity (especially the Confucian concept of benevolence (ä»ren)) before cultivating immortality. Ge concluded that dao is the ""root"" and ru is the ""branch."" Based on Ge Hongâs concepts, outer alchemy became popular in ancient China.",-200,900,501,1614,Ngoc Tho Nguyen,6,Matthew Hamm,2024-04-09 05:49:59.166 +0200,2024-04-11 21:40:46.268 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),1.6860180721957236e-11,1.926842711237517e-23,0.4918676769238805,0.4436692946437103,0.022201496942200853,0.01329580329301224,0.028965630181558347,1.1901576433670463e-13,9.799865858678958e-08
2327,OÌ£BAÌTAÌLA RELIGIOUS GROUP AMONG THE YORUBA OF ILEÌ-IFEÌÌ£,43,Religious Group (v6),"OÌ£BAÌTAÌLA RELIGIOUS GROUP AMONG THE YORUBA OF ILEÌ-IFEÌÌ£
The OÌ£baÌtaÌlaÌ religious group forms one of the cardinal traditional religious groups among the Yoruba in southwestern Nigeria. Just like most other groups, it is affiliated with one of the primordial deities in the Yoruba pantheon. OÌ£baÌtaÌlaÌ is also called OÌriÌsaÌ nÌlaÌ. OÌ£baÌtaÌlaÌ is believed among the Yoruba of Ile-Ife to be the arch divinity whom OloÌduÌmareÌ (the Supreme Being in Yoruba cosmology) saddled with the responsibility of creation of all that exists. It was noted that OÌ£baÌtaÌlaÌ overindulged himself in drinking palm wine, he then stepped aside to drink wine which resulted in him sleeping off. Having slept off, another deity OduÌduwaÌ picked up the item and proceeded to carry out the assignment having heard OloÌduÌmareÌ while instructing OÌ£baÌtaÌlaÌ. When OÌ£baÌtaÌlaÌ woke from his sleep, he discovered the situation and forbade himself and his children from ever taking palm wine. As a result, members of the group are forbidden from drinking palm wine. Another version of the Yoruba mythology notes that despite his failure in creating the universe, he was still responsible for the creation of humans. The Yoruba people believe that OloÌduÌmareÌ has much trust in OÌ£baÌtaÌlaÌ's creativity and capacity. Therefore, He did not commit much time into supervising and inspecting the humans he moulded before breading life into them. The myth states that OÌ£baÌtaÌlaÌ's negligence resulted in creating some humans with deformities. The Yoruba classify albinos, one legged, hunchback, blind and other physical disabilities as deformities resulting from OÌ£baÌtaÌlaÌ's defective creation. This act, the Yoruba traditionally hold as being responsible for the existence of people with different disabilities. In Yoruba parlance therefore, individuals with physical disabilities are referred to as eÌ£ni OÌriÌsaÌ which means the people of OÌriÌsaÌ (OÌ£baÌtaÌlaÌ being the OÌriÌsaÌ).
The group believes that OÌ£baÌtaÌlaÌ being the arch divinity embraces all other deities. This is demonstrated with the presence of shrines dedicated to some other deities in OÌ£baÌtaÌlaÌ compound. 
OÌ£baÌtaÌlaÌ is regarded as the essence of justice, purity, and clear thinking. He is wisdom personified and also represents cleanliness and calmness. His wisdom and cleanness results in his use of a white robe which is also replicated by members of the group. While his adherents are permitted to use other colours, places such as shrines that are considered sacred among the group can only be accessed by individuals arrayed in white clothing alone. The group's adherence to cleanliness as exemplified in OÌ£baÌtaÌlaÌ also makes it sacrosanct for anyone who would enter the compound or the palace of OÌ£baÌtaÌlaÌ in IgboÌ-IÌtaÌpaÌ in IleÌ-IfeÌ£Ì to put off their shoes at the gate before entry.
The group worships OÌ£baÌtaÌlaÌ following the Yoruba indigenous (traditional) calendar which comprises five days each week. The group also observes vigils. The OÌ£baÌtaÌlaÌ worshipers have houses built as palaces and halls for worship among others. The group also established schools like OÌ£baÌtaÌlaÌ Nursery and Primary School, IgboÌ-IÌtaÌpaÌ, IleÌ-IfeÌÌ£ where indigenous knowledge (OÌriÌsaÌ related topics) and western education subjects are taught. The group also âhas shrines where sacrifices are offered to OÌ£baÌtaÌlaÌ. It is believed that children of OÌ£baÌtaÌlaÌ are easily prone to stress and deadlines which often result in mental stress. However, this is often taken care of with the purchase of two coconuts, one will be offered to OÌ£baÌtaÌlaÌ while two holes will be punched in the other through which the fluid inside the coconut will be poured into a cup and applied into the person's scalp for some hours or overnight. The group maintains that once this is done, the individual will surely recover due to the calming effects of the procedure.",1900,2024,2406,1602,Ebenezer Elesemoyo,57,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,2024-04-10 11:52:47.739 +0200,2024-04-28 14:32:33.014 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.03889908955680644,0.14850445386805372,7.569673686244473e-14,0.36147072294318183,0.009116687727388403,0.1922427369018251,0.20388866367238115,0.04587758461602675,6.07142608049594e-08
2328,Church of Almighty God (Quannengshen jiaohui å¨è½ç¥ææ) / Eastern Lightning (Dongfang shandian æ±æ¹éé»),43,Religious Group (v6),"The âChurch of Almighty Godâ (Quannengshen jiaohui å¨è½ç¥ææ), also known as âEastern Lightningâ (Dongfang shandian æ±æ¹éé»), is a Protestant-inspired religious organization in post-Mao China and among Chinese diasporas worldwide. Its popular nickname, âEastern Lightning,â derives from Matthews 24:27, which prophesizes the future advent of God: âFor as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.â In line with earlier Chinese Christian communities, the Church of Almighty God (CAG) understands this iconic quotation as referring to the second advent of Christ as taking place in China. According to its teachings, Christ has already revealed himself, incarnated as a woman from central China. More importantly, practitioners believe that the Second Christ has revealed a new set of scriptures that supersede the conventional teachings, values, and practices codified in the Bible. Resembling traditional Chinese sectarian concepts of three stages in cosmic history (such as in Xiantiandao and Yiguandao), the Second Christâs activities mark the third period in Godâs scheme, which is the âAge of the Kingdomâ (guodu shidai ååº¦æä»£).
The CAG emerged in the milieu of Protestant-inspired new religious groups and underground churches in post-Mao China, a time marked by the rise of the Qigong wave and the emergence of Falungong æ³è¼ªå. Departing from conventional Protestantism, many Protestant-inspired groups sought to adapt Christian teachings to Chinese contexts by adding other symbols, teachings, and practices. For instance, many cherish steadfast faith as the central pillar of individual practice and well-being, and they promote an apocalyptic and millenarian understanding of the Christian tradition. Despite the abundance of material related to matters of faith provided online by the CAG, little is known of daily religious life in its communities. From what we know, the church promotes an iconoclastic framework that applies to standard Christian rituals and festivals (such as Christmas, Easter, or communion) and Chinese traditional festivals and cultural practices. Meetings do not seem to follow a formal liturgy for worship. Rather, members listen to sermons and share their thoughts and experiences afterward. Accordingly, writing and publishing testimonies, primarily through CAG websites, is among the most cherished practices of pious adepts. Most of them relate to spiritual journeys and how steadfast faith in the powers of Almighty God was instrumental in overcoming hardships. 
Even though the names of the founder and other leaders are almost absent from CAG material, it seems that it was founded by Zhao Weishan è¶ç¶­å±± (b. 1951), a man from the northeastern Chinese province of Heilongjiang é»é¾æ±ç. Before founding CAG in Henan Province æ²³åç, central China, in ca. 1991, he was affiliated with various Protestant-inspired groups in the late 1980s. It was he who declared a woman as the second incarnation of Christ. Usually, her name is absent from CAG material as well. In 2012, Chinese authorities revealed her purported identity as Yang Xiangbin æ¥åå½¬ (b. 1973) from Shanxi Province å±±è¥¿ç (just north of Henan), but this claim has not been corroborated by the CAG and academic scholars. Interpreted as the âutterances of Christ of the last days,â the Second Christâs speeches were collected and evolved into the groupâs focal scripture Hua zai roushen xianxian è©±å¨èèº«é¡¯ç¾ (The Word Appears in the Flesh). At the moment, it consists of two volumes: the first comprises texts from 1991 to 1997; the second was published in 2014 and has since outranked the first as the more authoritative scripture. Remarkably, in this volume and other recent publications, the role of the female Christ seems to have shrunk compared to that of Almighty God.
Like many other Protestant-inspired groups, the CAG was declared an âevil cultâ (xiejiao éªæ) in 1995. Even though robust statistics are not available and CAG activists sometimes report contradictory figures, several crackdowns by the Chinese government seem to have resulted in the detainment of up to hundreds of thousands of people. Moreover, according to CAG activists, at least dozens of practitioners have been killed by the authorities or died during detention. According to ethnographic research and unconfirmed claims, Zhao and the female Christ escaped to the United States in the early 2000s. 
During the 1990s and 2000s, the CAG seems to have been strongest in Henan and neighboring provinces, many of which are considered rural and poor compared to the fancy global metropolises of Shanghai, Beijing, and Shenzhen. Initially, most practitioners appeared to be elderly and often illiterate women, but more recent research indicates that the CAG also thrives in metropolitan areas. In 2014, the Chinese authorities estimated there would be 4 million practitioners in China, but these high numbers are likely exaggerated by public security institutions to justify the harsh measures. Due to the ongoing suppression of the church, during the past decade, considerable communities have also been established by refugees in South Korea, the Philippines, and the United States. 
The church is well-known for its opposition to conventional Christians unwilling to accept the superiority of their new revelations, for which they are labeled as âfakeâ or âanti-Christâ (jiajidu / dijidu ååºç£ï¼æµåºç£). Similarly, practitioners conceive of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) as the âgreat red dragonâ (dahonglong å¤§ç´é¾) mentioned in Revelation 12, i.e., an incarnation of Satan. Accordingly, the churchâs confrontation with the Party attains an eschatological meaning. Probably for these reasons, the CAG is a highly controversial organization in China and beyond. Chinese Christians and the government have blamed it for its allegedly coercive proselytization strategies, kidnapping, maltreatment, violence, and even involvement in a highly publicized homicide. On May 28, 2014, a group of six who allegedly belonged to the church killed a saleswoman in a McDonaldâs restaurant in eastern Chinaâs Zhaoyuan City æé å¸ (Shandong Province å±±æ±ç). The authorities were quick to blame the crime on the CAG, but close scrutiny by Western scholars suggests that the group was not a part of the church anymore or never has been. Still, the McDonaldâs murder incident has firmly established the churchâs negative image in the Chinese public, but also in Western media. 
Like in the case of Falungong, the Internet plays a pivotal role in the CAGâs activities: to circulate the scriptures and messages and to sustain a globally dispersed community. Besides archiving free books and other readings, especially testimonies, CAG websites provide many other services in different languages (41, at the moment of writing), including music videos, movies, sermons, hotlines, and a mobile phone app. In addition, the church also operates YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram accounts.",1991,2024,2407,1595,Nikolas Broy,45,Matthew Hamm,2024-04-11 02:13:55.689 +0200,2024-04-11 02:16:15.152 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.0003036857640932551,0.026341806773536147,1.778897188823537e-15,0.033433137816339595,0.00013187420492354575,2.2090623598624163e-12,6.549260936274293e-05,0.9113341694201208,0.02838983340941306
2329,HÃ²a Háº£o,43,Religious Group (v6),"HÃ²a Háº£o is a Vietnamese Buddhist religious movement that was founded in 1939 by Pontiff Huá»³nh PhÃº Sá» (Huá»³nh PhÃº Sá») in HÃ²a Háº£o village, TÃ¢n ChÃ¢u district, ChÃ¢u Äá»c province (current name: PhÃº Má»¹ town, PhÃº TÃ¢n district, An Giang Province). HÃ²a Háº£o Buddhism was also one of the millenarian sectarian movements in southern Vietnam in 19th and 20th centuries. Born into a wealthy family as a fragile boy, Huá»³nh PhÃº Sá» often needed medical assistance from different healers in the Mekong Delta region, and especially those from the sacred mountains of Tháº¥t SÆ¡n (Seven Mountains). After a bodily collapse, he claimed himself to be the reincarnation of Äá»©c Pháº­t Tháº§y TÃ¢y An (the Buddha Master of Western Peace). The Buddha Masterâs real name was ÄoÃ n Minh HuyÃªn, who founded Bá»­u SÆ¡n Ká»³ HÆ°Æ¡ng religion (Strange Fragrance from the Precious Mountain) in mid-19th century. Huá»³nh PhÃº Sá» gained popularity and attracted followers by the same methods of ÄoÃ n Minh HuyÃªn: predicting apocalyptic events, preaching religious philosophy, and healing a large number of people. Huá»³nh PhÃº Sá» had written HÃ²a Háº£o Buddhist scriptures in verses and in literature texts (Sáº¥m Giáº£ng) during 1939-1947 before disappeared in an unclarified event. The circumstance around his death was contested, but his disappearance gave rise to debates about his alleged position towards Vietnamese Communist Forces (Viá»t Minh). The event took place in the power struggle context of southern Vietnam: imperialism, millenarian, colonization, nationalism, and later, the southern Buddhist Reform in 1930 (Cháº¥n HÆ°ng Pháº­t GiÃ¡o). Caught in a conflicting position with different regimes, HÃ²a Háº£o Buddhism has redefined and renewed its political and religious positions since 1937. The current Vietnamese government acknowledged HÃ²a Háº£o Buddhism as a state-recognized religious group in 1999.

2330,Evangelical Church Winning All,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Evangelical Church Winning All, was until the year 2011 known as the Evangelical Church of West Africa. It is one of the largest Christian denominations in Nigeria. Its presence is overwhelming in Northern Nigeria as it has the largest membership of indigenous groups in that region of the country. Its membership strength is in excess of six million registered followers. The Christian group that is today called ECWA was introduced to Africa by Walter Gowans, Rowland Bingham of Canada and Thomas Kent of the United States through the Sudan Interior Mission in 1893. However, when the missionaries decided to hand over the SIM related churches to indigenous leadership in 1954, ECWA became the umbrella group through which the SIM-related churches (initially in Nigeria) came together to form an indigenous body. From this time, mission stations, seminaries and bible Schools, educational institutions and hospitals and other healthcare facilities came under the control of the ECWA leadership.

It is instructive to note that the vision for SIM, and by extension, ECWA was first born in the heart of a woman called Margaret (Craig) Gowans. Margaret, born in 1836 in Hamilton, Lanarkshire, Scotland was married to a brewer from Kilmarnock by the name, John Gowans (1836-1906) in 1861. She was the first individual in SIM history to conceive a vision to take the gospel to the Soudan. Her vision crystalized into the formation of ECWA and by extension the influence of the Christian group in the Muslim dominated northern Nigeria. Mr. and Mrs. John Gowanâs marriage was blessed with nine children. When the family emigrated to Toronto, Canada, in 1879, Mrs. Gowans began to fervently believe that a world-wide missions was an important part of the churchâs work. She played a significant part in influencing two of their children to become missionaries. Annie, their oldest child travelled to China in 1892 while Walter, her fifth, went to the Sudan a year later. Bingham was reported to have recalled an important conversation he had with Mrs. Gowans when she proudly informed him that her son had been called to go to the Sudan where 60-90 million people âlived without a single Christian missionary.â She was instrumental to the challenge which her son Walter, his friend Thomas Kent and later Roland Bingham took up to embrace Godâs heart (missions) for the people of Soudan. Their pioneering work of taking the Gospel to those of that region was one of Mrs. Gowanâs idea.
The acronym SIM first stood for âSoudan Interior Mission,â Soudan was an older variant of the Sudan region of West Africa. After various name changes, mergers and collaborations the mission agreed to go by the name âSIMâ today. In French-speaking countries it is called âSociÃ©tÃ© Internationale Missionnaire.â It comprises united organizations which were founded over a 100 years ago. The membership of this association includes Africa Evangelical Fellowship, Andes Evangelical Mission, International Christian Fellowship and Sudan Interior Mission.
The church has grown and spread its branches across most States of northern Nigeria being about the most visible Christian denomination in most parts of the region where the influence of Islam is overwhelming. It has suffered countless violent attacks from Islamic fundamentalists but has refused to give up on its ambition of making disciples of all nations where it is found. In recent times, it also began to make vigorous attempts at launching its mission works to other parts of Nigeria, Africa and beyond. The church has a well structured administrative apparatus. Its headquarters is located in Jos, Plateau State in northcentral Nigeria and it is headed by a President. There are four other key officers of the church who administer the affairs of the ministry. They all work from the Jos headquarters of the ministry. The church has been involved in giving education to the nation's youths since its advent in the country. It started with primary and secondary education, nursing and teacher training before recently establishing two universities for training youths in various vocations of their choice.

2335,The Seventh-day Adventist Church in Nigeria,43,Religious Group (v6),"THE SEVENTH DAY ADVENTIST CHURCH IN NIGERIA
Seventh-day Adventist (SDA) Church is a Sabbath Keeper and Protestant Christian denomination. made its entry into Nigeria in the year 1914 through efforts spearheaded by Elder David Caldwell Babcock who was born in New Hampshire, Ohio in United States of America on September 12, 1854. He arrived Nigeria with his family and missionaries: Dauphin, a Ghanaian and S. Morgues, a Sierra Leonean on March 7, 1914. Before his exit in 1918 as a result of ill health. Babcock had established three major branches in Erunmu (Oyo State), Shao (Kwara State) and Ipoti (Ekiti State).  It was from these branches that the present branches were organised. The Church is largely represented in the South West, South East and North East Nigeria. In a 2018 census conducted by the church, it reported having 234,200 members across the three Union Conferences that make up the SDA Church in the country. Presently, membership of the Church has now grown to about 278,000 members across 282 local assemblies in the country.
 From the emergence of the SDA Church in Nigeria, Special attentions were paid to the establishments of elementary schools where people could learn how to read and write. It was a priority for the Church to establish training centres where early Church workers were trained.  Shao became the first training ground for both Pastors and teachers. Additionally, this centre offered vocational skills, such as carpentry, bricklaying, woodwork and painting. As more souls were to the Church, new branches were opened and more schools. Presently, the Church has two universities (Babcock and Clifford), and many secondary and primary schools in Nigeria. 
As the Church kept on evangelising, it was planning to establish medical centres where people could get medical treatment. The structures, drugs and personnel were put in place to better the well being of the people. Statically, three medical centres were opened in Jengre (Northern Nigeria), Aba (Eastern Nigeria) and Ile-Ife (Western Nigeria). These were insufficient, hence, the need for more medical centres in Nigeria. The Church then opened more medical centres. Presently are many medical centres of which Babcock University Teaching is exceptionally impacting the whole Nigeria.  
The Church holds 28 fundamental beliefs that can be organised into six categories. These are: the doctrine of God, doctrines of man, salvation, church, Christian life and last day events. For a smooth administration in Nigeria, the Church this organigram. That is, Local Church, District, Conference and Union administrative offices. While local church oversees the running of the Church at the local level, the district coordinates the activities of the local churches within the same district. It is in the same manner that the conference superverses the works being carried out in the districts of the same jurisdiction.  Presently, in Nigeria the has three unions (Northern Nigerian Union-Abuja, Eastern Nigerian Union-Aba and Western Nigerian Union-Lagos) these control all the activities of the conferences under their territory.

2338,EnÅ«ma eliÅ¡,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"EnÅ«ma eliÅ¡, also known as Babylonian Epic of Creation and/or Poem of Exaltation of Marduk consists of  7 tablets and is a long narrative whose main protagonist is the Babylonian tutelar god, Marduk.  Although the date of its composition is still a subject of debate (with hypothesis ranging from the beginning until the end of the 2nd millennium BCE), historiography tends to point the period of Nebuchadnezzar Iâs reign (c. 1125-1104 BCE) as the most plausible one. Nevertheless, most of the manuscripts that survived until present-day are dated to the 1st millennium BCE, written in Babylonian or Assyrian. In what concerns the later, evidence from this version comes majorly from Assur, Nineveh, Nimrud and Sultantepe, and consists of copies and/or fragments from Middle Assyrian or Late Assyrian periods. As for the Babylonian tablets and fragments, they were mostly exhumed in Kish and Uruk, as well as in the âSippar Libraryâ (Lambert 2013: 3-4). It is safe to assume EnÅ«ma eliÅ¡ long survived the fall of the 6th century Babylonian power to the Achaemenid Dynasty, given that Berossus seems to have dedicated it a particular attention in his lost work Babyloniaca. Interestingly, many centuries later, the philosopher Damascius (6th century CE) still elaborated about EnÅ«ma eliÅ¡ based precisely on Berossusâs words (Dalley 2013).
EnÅ«ma eliÅ¡â importance throughout time and space must be explained by the combination of its polysemic nature with the reflection presented on the paradigm of a âgood rulerâ, through the archetypical figure of Marduk (Seri 2006). Concurrently, in EnÅ«ma eliÅ¡ one can find conceptions of the processes of cosmogony, theogony, and anthropogony, where old and new mythical traditions were intertwined in a detailed and calculated argument to further exalt Marduk, and, as such, its own urb, Babylon (Seri 2012, 2021; Almeida 2021). Moreover, the cosmic battle depicted between the primordial chaotic forces, led by TiÄmat, and the new generation of deities, led by Marduk, also presents itself as an opportunity to reflect on the (i)legitimacy of the act of war. As such, EnÅ«ma eliÅ¡, which was yearly dramatized during the celebrations of the Babylonian New Year Festival, appears as a fundamental scribal product, which reflected the rhetorical discourses of the institutional powers. It is worth noticing that within Assyria, its patron god AÅ¡Å¡ur takes the place of Marduk.
Since its first identification and translation by George (1876) in the 19th century, several authors presented their own proposals of transliterations and translations, including the seminal cuneiform edition of Lambert (1966, who presented a renewed translation in 2013), as well as Talon (2005), KÃ¤mmerer and Metzler (2012), and Feliu and Millet AlbÃ  (2014), amongst many others scholars.",-1200,550,476,1468,Isabel Gomes de Almeida,50,Andrew Danielson,2024-04-14 19:15:50.007 +0200,2024-04-17 18:10:16.533 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),1.3593548734459886e-11,1.009951280555906e-30,2.4219931549941367e-14,0.003944325503588092,1.4876098133343897e-27,2.708508124680977e-26,0.996055674482793,8.48556164652172e-21,1.2945206951994284e-15
2339,YorÃ¹bÃ¡ Traditional Religion,43,Religious Group (v6),"YorÃ¹bÃ¡ Traditional Religion
The YorÃ¹bÃ¡ are a distinct ethnic group found across a few countries of west Africa. They Ã²consider IlÃ©-Ifáº¹ as their ancestral home from where they migrated to all locations where they are currently found. They occupy the entire southwest Nigeria and are found in groups in Nigeriaâs north central staters of Kwara and Kogi as well as in the South-south region of Edo and Delta. The YorÃ¹bÃ¡ people are also found in places like Ghana, Benin Republic and Togo. The people have a rich cultural heritage which includes their religion. Scholars, while dissecting their religious practises have suggested several terminologies to describe their religious eco-system. Their indigenous religious structure has been described as polytheism, Poly-monotheism and diffused monotheism to mention a few. Their indigenous religious architecture has attracted such robust appraisal and reappraisal owing to its uniqueness, colour, glamour and the ingenuity of the people regarding their faith life.
The YorÃ¹bÃ¡ have OlÃ³dÃºmarÃ¨ at the apex of their religion. He is assisted in administering the universe by his retinue of deities (Ã²rÃ¬sÃ ). The Ã²rÃ¬sÃ  are of two classes. The first are the primordial deities and the second, deified gods/ancestors. Primordial deities among the YorÃ¹bÃ¡ include á»bÃ tÃ¡lÃ¡ or á»rÃºnmÃ­lÃ , ÃsÃ¹ while deified gods include SÃ ngÃ³ and Oya. Below the Ã²rÃ¬sÃ  are the personification of natural forces. The spirits/ghosts/apparitions and other phenomena are classified next to the natural forces. There is another class of beings (previously humans) who are looked upon as having attained some degree of awe, worship and reference. They are the ancestors who lived a good life and have transited the earthly realm to the realm beyond. 
OlÃ³dÃºmarÃ¨ is conceived as the almighty, the controller of the universe and the force behind order and symphony in the world. He is however held as being too busy with other issues beyond the daily running of the universe and has therefore placed the administration of the earth in the care of the numerous Ã²rÃ¬sÃ  who have their areas of specialization while intervening in human affairs. They Ã²rÃ¬sÃ  are consulted by humans whenever they seek solutions to issues that confront them. Some of the Ã²rÃ¬sÃ  are reputed as fertility gods/goddesses, others are consulted for vengeance on enemies, while some still are reputed for their strength in wars, battles and difficult challenges. Both the primordial deities and deified gods attend to the numerous challenges brought to them by members of the human community. The difference between the two classes of deities has become very blur such that many times, the deified gods are sometimes spoken of and treated as primordial deities.
 In the past, the YorÃ¹bÃ¡ depended on natural forces for protection. They relied on hills, mountains, rivers and forests/caves as defence against enemies. Many YorÃ¹bÃ¡ villages and communities soon began to venerate such natural forces either as fertility gods/goddesses or as their protectors. OlÃ³sÃ¹nta rock (Ikere Ekiti), á»Èun river (Osogbo) Oke Ibadan (Ibadan) are good examples of personification of natural forces in Yorubaland. Some of the deities are also reputed to deploy natural forces like thunder, whirlwind, and storms (eg. SÃ ngÃ³) in the defence of their votaries. Besides the natural forces, the YorÃ¹bÃ¡ also belief in Spirits, apparitions and ghosts. They recognise spirits that inhabit forests, trees and other natural elements. Ancestors are the closest of the non-human/divine beings which the YorÃ¹bÃ¡ people recognise. They are believed to be around and always present within the human community they once lived in. They are moral agents who listen to every conversation, pay attention to the strict observance of taboos and every other aspect of the lives of the people. They could reward and punish for good and bad conducts. 
Aside those in their ancestral homes, Africans in the diaspora also exported their religions in their sojourns and have continued to identify with their deities and other traditional practices for several centuries. For examples, in places like Trinidad and Tobago, Brazil, Cuba, Portugal among others, Africans and in this case, the YorÃ¹bÃ¡ have continued to showcase their religion and culture in territories and nations where they are found. The YorÃ¹bÃ¡ indigenous religion is indeed complex but exciting. Unlike some world religions, they are not prone to religious extremism which breeds violence and intolerance. Rather, each religious group observes their festivals, ceremonies and worship without the fear of violence from other groups. Religious syncretism is at its peak among the people. Votaries of one religious group accompany their friends and relations to worship their deities and they reciprocate this gesture to one another during their religious observances. 
The religious festivals of the people are usually colourful, lively and full of symbols. They begin their traditional year, planting seasons, harvest times and indeed all their significant occasions with prayers and venerations to their gods and goddesses who are believed to be intermediaries between OlÃ³dÃºmarÃ¨ and human beings. The gods/goddesses know their boundaries and do not ascribe to themselves the honour that is due to the supreme being. Rather, they are said to receive the sacrifice from the human community and present them to OlÃ³dÃºmarÃ¨ for His attention and approval.",1100,2024,2414,1526,Oyeyemi Oyekan,57,Adegbola Tolu Adefi,2024-04-15 09:56:22.735 +0200,2024-04-30 22:47:03.321 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.2687439266852719,0.45932525987234996,4.308707106502957e-14,0.23845334363844164,0.0001956098664371837,0.02929452388052634,1.1394280986114946e-12,0.0039873360557905625,1.351143354286765e-18

2342,Ugaritic Ba'lu Cycle,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"The BaÊ¿lu Cycle is an ancient mythological tale from the Late Bronze Age city of Ugarit (modern Ras Shamra in the region of Latakia, Syria). The principal protagonist of the narrative is the Canaanite storm god BaÊ¿lu (Hebrew Baal), the tutelary deity of the city-state of Ugarit. Among BaÊ¿luâs epithets, he is called Haddu/Hadad as well as the Son of Dagan. The Cycle survives on a series of clay tablets (KTU 1.1-6 + 1.8; see Pardee 2009), with only about half of the original contents of the myth preserved. It nevertheless constitutes the longest and âmost important literary work from West Semitic peoples in the second millennium BCEâ (Pardee 1997). As such, it provides an important window full of invaluable insights into the religious beliefs of ancient Ugaritians and related peoples (e.g. Canaanites).

Although there has been debate about the order of the tablets, the BaÊ¿lu Cycle can be divided into three major sections/themes: (1) the battle between BaÊ¿lu and the god Yammu/Sea (KTU 1.1-2); (2) the construction of BaÊ¿luâs palace (KTU 1.3-4); and (3) the battle between BaÊ¿lu and the god MÃ´tu/Death (KTU 1.5-6). In the following summary, the order and description follows Pardeeâs translation in Context of Scripture. The first tablet (KTU 1.1) is relatively incomplete and its relationship to the rest of the story remains unclear (Smith 1994: 14-19), but it appears to be about envoys sent from Ê¾Ilu, the chief deity in the Ugaritic/Canaanite pantheon, to the goddess Ê¿Anatu and the god KoÌtÌ±aru-wa-HÌ®asÄ±Ìsu. After a break of unknown length, tablet two (KTU 1.2) recounts Yammuâs message to Ê¾Ilu and the Great (divine) Assembly that they should âgive (up) BaÊ¿lu, the son of Daganâ (KTU 1.2 I 18-19), to which Ê¾Ilu accedes. Enraged BaÊ¿lu swears to destroy Yammu, and with the support of KoÌtÌ±aru-wa-HÌ®asÄ±Ìsu and ê¥AtÌ±tartu, he defeats Yammu. Although the end of this tablet is fragmented, some of the final words of this scene are clear: âYammu is certainly dead, O BaÊ¿lu â¦ Yammu is certainly deadâ (KTU 1.2 IV 32, 34). Tablet three concerns a feast for BaÊ¿lu as well as his message to his sister ê¥Anatu to whom he announces his desire for a palace. After ê¥Anatu is unsuccessful in convincing Ê¾Ilu, tablet four describes the conscription of Ê¾Aá¹¯iratu to BaÊ¿luâs cause. Ê¾Aá¹¯iratu, the great mother goddess and wife of Ê¾Ilu, proves successful; Ê¾Ilu proclaims: âLet a house be built for BaÊ¿lu like that of the gods, a court like that of the sons of Ê¾Aá¹¯iratuâ (ybn . bt . l bÊ¿l km . á»lm . w á¸¥áºr . k bn . áº£á¹¯rt; KTU 1.4 IV 62-V 1). The scene ends with the successful construction of BaÊ¿luâs palace (i.e., temple) by KoÌtÌ±aru-wa-HÌ®asÄ±Ìsu, the divine artisan and craftsman deity, and with an inaugural banquet. The third major scene of the cycle begins with BaÊ¿luâs hubristic decision to send a taunting message to MÃ´tu, called âson of Ê¾Iluâ (bn ilm) and âbeloved of Ê¾Ilu, the warriorâ (ydd . il . gÌzr). After a back-and-forth between BaÊ¿lu and MÃ´tu, described in tablet five which is otherwise damaged, it seems that BaÊ¿lu invites MÃ´tu to a feast in the latterâs honor, perhaps as a ploy to conduct battle with him. After a substantial break, the reader is informed through messengers sent to Ê¾Ilu that Mighty BaÊ¿lu is dead, news which causes Ê¾Ilu to lament. Tablet five ends with ê¥Anatu searching for where BaÊ¿lu has fallen, and tablet six opens with her lament for BaÊ¿lu, including self-laceration. After Ê¾Ilu and Ê¾Aá¹¯iratuâs unsuccessful attempt to replace BaÊ¿lu with ê¥AtÌ±taru as king, ê¥Anatu visits and punishes MÃ´tu; she seizes him, splits him with a knife, winnows him with a winnowing-fork, burns him with fire, pulverizes him with grindstones, then sows him in the field so that the birds can eat his flesh. It is ê¥Anatu who defeats MÃ´tu which allows for the revival of BaÊ¿lu. After BaÊ¿lu resumes his kingly estate, MÃ´tu nevertheless seeks revenge; BaÊ¿lu and MÃ´tu battle. With the intervention of Å apÅ¡u (the Sun), MÃ´tu capitulates, leaving BaÊ¿lu to remain on his royal throne. Finally, the text ends with a hymn of praise to Å apÅ¡u and her entourage (including the RapaÊ¾Å«ma and KoÌtÌ±aru-wa-HÌ®asÄ±Ìsu) as well as Ê¾IlÄ±Ìmilkuâs colophon.

Hermeneutically, scholars have proposed numerous interpretations of the myth, including interpretations centered on the seasonal pattern, ritual interpretations, sociohistorical or political readings, or cosmogonic theories (see Smith 1994: 58-114). While the text addresses a combination of these facets, the core of the text is primarily about kingship, i.e., BaÊ¿luâs struggle for divine kingship in the mythological sphere and how it reflects the struggles, responsibilities, legitimation, and divine authority of human kingship on earth. To a lesser extent, the Cycle also provides an etiology for BaÊ¿luâs role as the patron deity of Ugarit and the construction of his temple therein.",-1350,-1200,1084,1379,Matthew Saunders,50,Andrew Danielson,2024-04-17 17:08:35.089 +0200,2024-04-18 02:34:15.779 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.028756926385735525,0.23512653647123385,2.9691139910079263e-15,0.01055900240044904,5.6117111690951486e-14,0.02143846777561064,0.7041190594996473,7.467264606943503e-09,7.037066059834036e-20

2348,Ancient Israelite Religion (Iron Age),43,Religious Group (v6),"The ancient Israelite religion(s) of the Iron Age, spanning the 12th through 6th centuries BCE, represents a significant period of religious development, most importantly for producing the text of the Hebrew Bible and culminating in the formation of what would later become Judaism and Christianity. In his monumental treatment of ancient Israelite religion through the lens of divinity, Lewis (2020: 2-8) outlines a lengthy list of topics that encompasses its study, including, inter alia, the study of divinity (e.g. pantheons, individual deities, divine councils and assemblies), sacred time and space (e.g.  religious calendars, sacred architecture), cultic paraphernalia (e.g. apotropaic objects, symbols), religious praxis (e.g. rituals, religious festivals, dietary regulations, the organizing principles of cult, etc.), religious personnel (kings, priests, prophets, and other religious actors), the reflective side of religion (e.g. theology, wisdom literature), and its various aesthetic presentations (literature, music, art, and dance). Studying ancient Israelite religion is an interdisciplinary enterprise that must be approached from various scholarly perspectives, each of which offer unique insights into the beliefs and practices of the Israelites and Judeans of the Iron Age Southern Levant. These disciplines include the historical-critical analysis of the Hebrew Bible, archaeology, art history, sociology, anthropology, comparative religious studies, philology and literary analysis, and various other interdisciplinary approaches that shed light on the origins, iconography, characterization, and worship of the ancient Israelâs deities such as El, Yahweh, Asherah, and Baal (Niditch 1997; Hess 2007; Lewis 2020). Although a critical reading of the Hebrew Bible has long been the main source of information for understanding both traditional and non-traditional expressions of Yahwism, new information gleaned from archaeological excavations is gradually becoming a major player in the reconstruction of the diversity of ancient Israelite religious practices (Faust 2020). Utilizing a multifaceted methodological approach, scholars can dissect the intricate layers of ancient Israelite religion, shedding light on fundamental distinctions between official/national/state religion centered around institutionalized practices and cultic institutions like the Jerusalem temple, and family/domestic/daily religion comprising household devotion to local gods and familial traditions such as ancestor veneration and the rites of the cults of the dead (Lewis 1989). For example, one particularly fruitful case study of religious development in the history of ancient Israel from its Canaanite ancestry to its Jewish progeny is the origins and development of biblical monotheism (Albright 1940; Smith 2001) in the context of its polytheistic milieu (Cross 1973; Van Der Toorn, Becking, and Van Der Horst 1999).",-1200,-500,2424,1379,Matthew Saunders,50,Andrew Danielson,2024-04-22 05:45:45.188 +0200,2024-04-23 06:08:29.264 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.0022222631986023797,0.10362839519298787,2.09369660595396e-15,0.08422184410853466,0.003939469986598391,0.6780481713614501,0.0008770901646548508,0.1270627208464889,4.5140680583737385e-08
2349,Methodism (Wesleyanism),43,Religious Group (v6),"Methodism, or Wesleyanism, as it is contemporarily understood, is a system of Christian theology originally taught by the Anglican cleric, John Wesley (1703-1791). Wesleyanism centrally supports Jesus Christ's Two Greatest Commandments that He taught during His ministry: all believers must love God with all their heart, mind, soul and strength, and each is to love one's neighbour as oneself (Matthew 22:36-40). John Wesley's ideas are firmly rooted in Biblical scripture and Christ's teachings throughout the four Gospels. As such, Wesleyanism still upholds the tenets first articulated by Wesley, such as the centrality of moral responsibility, experiential religion, and fostering proactive evangelistic practices to reach the unchurched and disadvantaged. Originating in the early-mid eighteenth-century, John, with his brother Charles, spearheaded the Methodist movement, which was purposed to bring spiritual revival within the Church of England. The Wesleys spiritual leanings were awakened in part by John's experiences aboard a turbulent voyage to the colony of Georgia in January 1736. During a perilous storm, Wesley witnessed the unexplainable peace of a group of Moravian missionaries, who, instead of being fearful of the elements, appeared seemingly unbothered. Wesley was deeply moved by the remarkable composure of the Moravians, which he credited to their profound faith in God, and later joined a religious society comprised of Moravian Christians in London to learn more about their spirituality. In May 1738, Wesley experienced what he came to call his conversion experience to evangelicalism, where he felt his ""heart warmed"" by the Holy Spirit, and began his own ministry. Wesley did not intend to establish a new church but originally sought reform within the Church of England due to its systemic duplicity (much like Martin Luther's efforts to incite reform within the Roman Catholic Church during the early sixteenth century). Nevertheless, as Wesley's teachings disseminated, there was a steady awakening of ""societies"" which grew into the Methodist movement. The earliest Methodist ""church"" was arguably established in London near the end of 1739. About a dozen individuals deeply convicted of their sins and eagerly looking for redemption sought Wesley there. Together, Wesley spent time with them in prayer and advised the group on how to escape the coming wrath of the age. They met together weekly (usually on Thursday evenings) and many more soon after desired to join their meetings. Wesley wrote ""The Guides and Helps to Holy Living"" for his followers; not as a replacement to the Bible but as a supplemental guide on holy living. Wesley widely traveled across Great Britain and preached outdoors to large crowds. He helped form and organize Christian societies that rallied around personal moral accountability, religious instruction, and discipleship. These Christians became known as Methodists for their distinct ""methodical"" ways of practicing the faith and their mutual accountability of holding each other to the ""Way."" Under Wesleyâs leadership, Methodists became leaders in many social issues of the day, such as prison reform and the abolition of slavery and the transatlantic slave trade. Wesleyâs teachings were collectively known as Wesleyan theology or Methodism, which informed the practices of Methodist societies across the British Empire. One of Wesleyâs most compelling ideas was how by faith a believer was transformed into the likeness of Christ, and could subsequently achieve a state where the love of God reigned in their heart. This gave them an inward rather than an outward holiness. Methodism strove to cultivate a spiritual community among members that concentrated on the soul and not the physical body; a truly radical philosophy at the height of the transatlantic slave trade. As such, Methodists attracted many Black converts such as Olaudah Equiano, a notable Black late eighteenth century seafarer, author, and former slave. The movement spread to North America through the emigration of Methodists, who, in the 1760s, began to organize the Methodist ""classes"" and ""societies"" in the colonies. In December 1784 at the Christmas Conference in Baltimore, Maryland, the Methodist Episcopal Church was formally organized. The new church experienced a surge of members and quickly became one of the leading religious forces among the Protestant denominations in the new United States of America. Although John Wesley and the earliest Methodist leaders in America were staunchly against human slavery, the invention of the cotton gin and the economic advantages to slavery in the late eighteenth century led many Methodist ministers and members to become slaveholders. Abhorred by the slaveholding practices in the church, a group of ministers, led by Orange Scott, began to agitate for a new abolition of slavery within the Methodist church. With bishops and other members of the church seeking to silence these outspoken ministers in order to preserve the status quo within their congregations, a series of ministerial and church withdrawals from the Methodist Episcopal Church began in the early 1840s. Methodists who were staunchly opposed to slavery organized a convention at Utica, New York in May-June 1843 where they established a new name for their church: the Wesleyan Methodist Connection of America. This ""connection"" was an organization of local churches that avoided episcopacy and provided for equal ministerial and lay representation in all of its governing bodies. This reformed ""Wesleyan"" Methodism of sorts emphasized moral and social reform, evangelism, and prohibited the consumption of intoxicating liquors and all practices of slaveholding. Today, churches that identify as ""Wesleyan"" are still denominationally Protestant and retain an orthodoxy (and orthopraxy) reflective of the reformed teachings, values, and practices of earlier traditions.",1738,2024,2426,1560,Bethany Henderson,1,M.

2365,Moriscos,43,Religious Group (v6),"The Moriscos were a distinct people of Hispano-Muslim identity who had accepted Christian baptism within the Iberian Peninsula during the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. They were the descendants of Spanish Muslims who converted to Christianity under duress in 1502 following the surrender of the last remaining Islamic state in Iberia in 1492, the Kingdom of Grenada. Due to ongoing unrest by madejares in the years following the conquest of Grenada, King Ferdinand and Queen Isabel revoked a treaty that protected the religious freedoms of Muslims in return for their political loyalty. Ferdinand and Isabel's union signalled a new epoch, as the union of Castile and Aragon facilitated a broader movement towards national and religious unification for the Spanish kingdoms. A mandate was subsequently issued that ordered all Castilian Muslims to either depart the kingdom or accept baptism. This strategy of assimilating Muslims into a homogenized Spanish Christian society spread to the Kingdoms of Navarre and Valencia in 1515 and then to Aragon during the 1520s. Ferdinand's edict led to the baptism of hundreds of thousands of madejares or ""nuevos conversos de moros"" (new Moorish converts). While the Church expected the sacramental efficacy of baptism to transform the hearts of Moriscos, many continued to practice Islam as secret (or crypto) Muslims. After the expulsion of dissident Muslims in 1502, many Moriscos transformed their homes into spaces of resistance where families spoke the prohibited Arabic language, uttered prayers, acknowledged holy days and fasts, circumcised their male infants, maintained dietary restrictions, wore traditional costumes, and participated in ritual washing. The Muslim principle of ""taqiyya"" (often translated as ""dissimulation"" or ""precaution"") granted Muslims whose lives or livelihoods were threatened the ability to conform to Christianity outwardly while inwardly adhering to their true Islamic convictions. Moriscos could assume a nominal Christianized public-image in order to receive certain political privileges, but maintain a clandestine domestic devotion to Islam. However, others that demonstrated a sincerity towards Christianity were nevertheless treated with suspicion by Old Christians due to the perceived ambiguity between Islamic devotion and mere cultural tradition. As the sixteenth century wore on, Muslim cultural differences were interpreted by the Spanish Inquisition and Old Christians as Morisco deviance, which was inextricably linked with apostasy. Old Christians harboured a distinct racial discrimination towards Moriscos, believing them to be deceptive and dishonest. Old Christians asserted that their families did not descend from Jewish or Muslim ancestry but had ""pure"" Christian bloodlines (""limpieza de sangre"" or ""of purity of blood""). They consequently treated Morisco cultural activities as dubious and incompatible with Spanish Christianity despite many converts having abandoned their customs by adapting to Old Christian practices after baptism. Throughout the century, strict new laws were placed on Moriscos to strip them of lingering practices that linked them to an Islamic past. Spain's war against Morisco autonomy led to periodic bursts of conflict throughout the sixteenth century, such as the second Rebellion of the Alpujarras (1568-1571). The New Christians were pigeonholed by the implications of Spain's mandates which naturally elicited unrest due to its racialized legislation. The insistence of religious and secular authorities pressured Moriscos to conform to Christianity and abandon Islam, but Old Christian fears and doubts made integration into Spanish society impossible. For Spain, Moriscos threatened the religious stability of the kingdom which in turn jeopardized the Crown's sovereignty. By the seventeenth century, after a century of contention between Old Christians and Moriscos, King Philip III ordered the expulsion of all Moriscos from Spain in 1609: his solution to the ongoing ""Morisco problem."" The Moriscos of Valencia were the first to be expelled, where the population was densest and the threat of an alliance with an Islamic power in the Mediterranean was greatest. Over the next five years, this decree was implemented systematically throughout the rest of Spain until the expulsion was considered complete and pronounced a ""success"" in 1614. It is estimated that approximately 300,000 Moriscos were expelled from Spain between 1609 and 1614. Several thousand Moriscos avoided expulsion by either assimilating into virtual invisibility among Old Christian culture (e.g. marrying Old Christians) or receiving exceptional dispensations by the Crown. Although expelled Moriscos could live openly as Muslims in their places of resettlement along the Barbary Coast within the Ottoman Empire, their unique experiences in Spain consequently gave rise to complex issues of identity that were tenuous, ambiguous, and fractured.",1502,1614,2452,1560,Bethany Henderson,1,M.

2366,Islam in Hausaland,43,Religious Group (v6),"Defining the Hausaland is somewhat quagmiry. This is because some scholars give its definition based on the land where peopleâs mother tongue is Hausa language. Meanwhile, the land covers in the main a large area of northern Nigeria and part of the present-day Republic of Niger. The territory of the Hausa states lay above the confluence of the Niger and Benue rivers (in present-day northern Nigeria), between the Songhai empire in the west and that of the Kanem-Bornu, or Bornu, in the east. The seven true Hausa states, or Hausa Bakwai (Biram, Daura, Gobir, Kano, Katsina, Rano, and Zaria (Zazzau), and their seven outlying satellites, or Banza Bakwai (Zamfara, Kebbi, Yauri, Gwari, Nupe, Kororofa (Jukun), and Yoruba), had no central authority, were never combined in wars of conquest, and were therefore frequently subject to domination from outside.
The historians had spoken with one voice regarding the origin of the Hausaland. They opined that the original seven kingdoms of the Hausaland were traceable to a Muslim Arab man called Abu Zayd or Hawdhah. The latter left his native land (Baghdad) to this part of Nigeria in the late 8th century. He then rambled the land till he arrived at the place called Daura. Thereafter, his grandchildren later became the seven Hausa rulers of Daura, Kano, Katsina, Zakzaki, Zamfara, Rano and Buram. It is believed that this Muslim Arab man tended to be a survival of the Umayyad people displaced as a result of the Abbasid people that had toppled their dynasty. Thus, this man might have been responsible for the introduction of Islam in the society, and the nature of the idolaters who used to revert to their former faith might have made Islam to later become a thing of the past in the society.
As far as the advent of Islam in Hausaland, scores of scholarly historians have written at great length on the topic. According to the Kano Chronicle, a Muslim community had been found in Kano by the middle of the 14th century. The introduction of Islam into the society is said to have been traceable to some missionaries who hailed from Mali. In another historical account on the advent of Islam in Hausaland, Katsina, which is regarded as the seat of civilization and culture, some of its indigenes are said to have been the pioneer Muslims. This is because the city is topographically situated the route of the traversing caravans from Timbuktu to Borno and Egypt. And there was a big market there that the Barbarians, Wangara and the Arabs used to patronize in the middle of the 12th century.  The precise date of the advent of Islam in Katsina is unknown; but the inhabitants of this region had been in contact with Islam since time immemorial. Meanwhile, the spread of Islam to Kano in the 13th century is believed to have been precipitated by the influx of the Wangara to place.
Muhammad Ibn Abd al-Karim al-Maghili, a Berber Islamic scholar, in the course of touring North and West Africa also arrived in Kano in 1492 while on a journey that took him to Mecca as well as Air, Gao and Katsina among other places. In the course of his stopover at Kano, he organized and saw to the religious needs of the North Africa community there. Besides, it was chronicled that he handwrote a Qurá¾¿Ã£n for the people of Kano, for he had not brought a copy with him, and had to teach the Qurá¾¿Ã£n and the punishment of the law. The visitation of al-Maghili to Kano took place in the second half of the 15th century during Muhammad Rumfaâs regime (1463-1499), and that had enhanced the stability of Islam and the spread of the Islamic guidelines in this part of the world. This writing is concerned about the Hausa people, their belief system, how Islam was brought into being in Hausa-land, and its impact on the lives of the people there. It deals with the ancient cities like Kano, Katsina, Zaria, Daura, Kebbi and so on, which are situated in the present day northern Nigeria.",1500,2024,2453,1569,Abdul mumin Alawiye,55,Julian Weideman,2024-04-29 18:02:18.348 +0200,2024-05-05 11:48:07.335 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),2.680763260699231e-06,0.0926087198223758,3.0210990852211815e-15,0.0997793426220821,0.00017221152292652857,4.3408221415548064e-13,2.714522506410461e-06,0.5891334337196175,0.21830089702679392

2372,Codex Borbonicus,52,Religious Text (v1.0),"El CÃ³dice BorbÃ³nico es un cÃ³dice religioso y adivinatorio pintado sobre papel amatl. De las 40 hojas que se componÃ­a originalmente, se han perdido las dos primeras y las dos Ãºltimas. EstÃ¡ formado por tres secciones: el Tonalamatl, la representaciÃ³n de un siglo mesoamericano de 52 aÃ±os y las dieciocho fiestas de las veintenas del aÃ±o solar (ff. 23-37). El Tonalamatl es la representaciÃ³n del calendario adivinatorio prehispÃ¡nico, formado por la combinaciÃ³n de 13 numerales y 20 signos de los dÃ­as. La combinaciÃ³n de numerales y de signos lleva a la creaciÃ³n de trecenas. En el manuscritos, cada trecena ocupa una lÃ¡mina, por lo que las lÃ¡minas de la 3 a la 20 estÃ¡n dedicadas a este cÃ³mputo del tiempo. Era una herramienta mÃ¡ntica que los especialistas rituales utilizaban para adivinar sobre aspectos como la guerra, los matrimonios, los nacimientos de los niÃ±os, etcÃ©tera. La segunda secciÃ³n estÃ¡ formada por dos lÃ¡minas (21 y 22) donde se representan 52 signos, cada uno relacionado con un aÃ±o, por lo que la suma de los 52 coincide con la cuenta de un âsiglo mesoamericanoâ. En la parte central de la lÃ¡mina 21 estÃ¡n representados los ancestros de la humanidad, Oxomoco y Cipactonal. En la lÃ¡mina 22 el centro estÃ¡ ocupado por los hermanos enemigos QuetzalcÃ³atl y Tezcatlipoca. Las lÃ¡minas de la 23 a la 37 estÃ¡n dedicadas a las dieciocho fiestas de las veintenas. Se trataba de festividades cÃ­clicas del calendario solar, formado por dieciocho perÃ­odos de veinte dÃ­as, donde se llevaban a cabo ofrendas, sacrificios, procesiones, danzas y banquetes. En el cÃ³dice, la cuenta de las veintenas empieza por Izcalli y termina repitiendo la misma veintena. Para cada lÃ¡mina dedicada a una fiesta hay representaciones de las divinidades veneradas, asÃ­ como de diferentes actividades relacionadas con los festejos.",1500,1550,585,1287,Elena Mazzetto,54,Diana Moreiras,2024-05-02 19:32:53.508 +0200,2024-05-31 18:43:15.304 +0200,Database of Religious History (DRH),0.999999999999277,5.2083468494018604e-21,2.079711322097196e-27,2.4705067130041746e-15,2.0321773834540404e-27,3.517314812623512e-15,7.170948221570764e-13,1.7149416424789834e-23,4.8707785427439486e-42
