In terms of checking whether "Christianity" is driving the effect, I am wondering how broadly you want to cast the net Willis.
Some entries that are not tagged directly as Christian are part of the broader tradition, e.g.
- Irish Catholicism (tagged as "Catholic")
- Romanian Orthodox Church (tagged as "Orthodoxy").
Actually, I am surprised that these are not (also) tagged as Christianity (e.g., "Catholic" is a level 3 tag and should have "Christian traditions" as a level 2 tag I believe, but has no tag at level 2).
